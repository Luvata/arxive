      <title>A Comparative Study of Controllability, Explainability, and Performance in Dysfluency Detection Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in dysfluency detection have introduced a variety of modeling paradigms, ranging from lightweight object-detection inspired networks (YOLOStutter) to modular interpretable frameworks (UDM). While performance on benchmark datasets continues to improve, clinical adoption requires more than accuracy: models must be controllable and explainable. In this paper, we present a systematic comparative analysis of four representative approaches--YOLO-Stutter, FluentNet, UDM, and SSDM--along three dimensions: performance, controllability, and explainability. Through comprehensive evaluation on multiple datasets and expert clinician assessment, we find that YOLO-Stutter and FluentNet provide efficiency and simplicity, but with limited transparency; UDM achieves the best balance of accuracy and clinical interpretability; and SSDM, while promising, could not be fully reproduced in our experiments. Our analysis highlights the trade-offs among competing approaches and identifies future directions for clinically viable dysfluency modeling. We also provide detailed implementation insights and practical deployment considerations for each approach.</description>

      <title>Beyond Memorization: Reasoning-Driven Synthesis as a Mitigation Strategy Against Benchmark Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capability evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly shadowed by rising concerns of data contamination that cast doubts on whether static benchmarks measure genuine reasoning or mere memorization. We present an empirical study using an infinitely scalable framework to synthesize research-level QA directly from arXiv papers, harnessing the natural temporal structure of research publications where performance decay after knowledge cutoffs may indicate potential contamination. We evaluated 4 frontier model represented by 2 models of different knowledge cutoff dates per family on 1,643 multi-step reasoning questions synthesized from 20,277 arXiv papers stratified over 26 months, covering at least 6 months before and after all cutoff dates. Our results consistently showed a lack of significant performance decay near knowledge cutoff dates for models of various sizes, developers, and release dates. We further performed a comparative analysis with previous longitudinal studies that reported significant post-cutoff performance decay using directly retrieved questions based on public data. we hypothesize that the multi-step reasoning required by our synthesis pipeline offered additional complexity that goes deeper than shallow memorization, which effectively serves a mitigation strategy against benchmark contamination. We fully open source our code and dataset to aid reproducibility and advocate for a paradigm shift that prioritize reasoning-driven synthesis to construct benchmarks over simply collecting newly released questions periodically.</description>

      <title>Language and Experience: A Computational Model of Social Learning in Complex Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to combine linguistic guidance from others with direct experience is central to human development, enabling safe and rapid learning in new environments. How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games, we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured, language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative learning.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Guided Loop: Achieving Reasoning through Uncertainty-Aware Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning models often outperform smaller models but at 3--5$\times$ higher cost and added latency. We present entropy-guided refinement: a lightweight, test-time loop that uses token-level uncertainty to trigger a single, targeted refinement pass. We extract logprobs, compute Shannon entropy on top-$k$ alternatives, and apply a simple OR-logic trigger over perplexity, maximum token entropy, and low-confidence-token count. Unlike approaches that use entropy only for measurement or decoding, we pass a compact uncertainty report (tokens, confidences, alternatives, context) back to the model to guide corrective edits. On representative technical queries across reasoning, mathematics, and code generation tasks, a small model with our loop approaches 95\% of a reference reasoning model's quality at approximately one-third of the cost. The method achieves selective refinement on ~31\% of responses while improving accuracy by 16 percentage points over single-pass inference. We demonstrate that this uncertainty-aware loop provides an effective middle ground between single-pass inference and expensive reasoning chains, making it practical for production deployments where both quality and cost matter.</description>

      <title>Wrong Face, Wrong Move: The Social Dynamics of Emotion Misperception in Agent-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of humans to detect and respond to others' emotions is fundamental to understanding social behavior. Here, agents are instantiated with emotion classifiers of varying accuracy to study the impact of perceptual accuracy on emergent emotional and spatial behavior. Agents are visually represented with face photos from the KDEF database and endowed with one of three classifiers trained on the JAFFE (poor), CK+ (medium), or KDEF (high) datasets. Agents communicate locally on a 2D toroidal lattice, perceiving neighbors' emotional state based on their classifier and responding with movement toward perceived positive emotions and away from perceived negative emotions. Note that the agents respond to perceived, instead of ground-truth, emotions, introducing systematic misperception and frustration. A battery of experiments is carried out on homogeneous and heterogeneous populations and scenarios with repeated emotional shocks. Results show that low-accuracy classifiers on the part of the agent reliably result in diminished trust, emotional disintegration into sadness, and disordered social organization. By contrast, the agent that develops high accuracy develops hardy emotional clusters and resilience to emotional disruptions. Even in emotionally neutral scenarios, misperception is enough to generate segregation and disintegration of cohesion. These findings underscore the fact that biases or imprecision in emotion recognition may significantly warp social processes and disrupt emotional integration.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Debates with Local Large Language Models for AI Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) take on greater roles in high-stakes decisions, alignment with human values is essential. Reliance on proprietary APIs limits reproducibility and broad participation. We study whether local open-source ensemble debates can improve alignmentoriented reasoning. Across 150 debates spanning 15 scenarios and five ensemble configurations, ensembles outperform single-model baselines on a 7-point rubric (overall: 3.48 vs. 3.13), with the largest gains in reasoning depth (+19.4%) and argument quality (+34.1%). Improvements are strongest for truthfulness (+1.25 points) and human enhancement (+0.80). We provide code, prompts, and a debate data set, providing an accessible and reproducible foundation for ensemble-based alignment evaluation.</description>

      <title>MODE: Mixture of Document Experts for RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) often relies on large vector databases and cross-encoders tuned for large-scale corpora, which can be excessive for small, domain-specific collections. We present MODE (Mixture of Document Experts), a lightweight alternative that replaces fine-grained nearest-neighbor search with cluster-and-route retrieval. Documents are embedded, grouped into semantically coherent clusters, and represented by cached centroids. At query time, we route to the top centroid(s) and retrieve context only within those clusters, eliminating external vector-database infrastructure and reranking while keeping latency low. On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora with 100-500 chunks, MODE matches or exceeds a dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while reducing end-to-end retrieval time. Ablations show that cluster granularity and multi-cluster routing control the recall/precision trade-off, and that tighter clusters improve downstream accuracy. MODE offers a practical recipe for small and medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus matter.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Monitoring and Real-World Evaluation of Agentic AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of 84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only 30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance. Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds. We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist accompany this paper to facilitate replication.</description>

      <title>Know When to Explore: Difficulty-Aware Certainty as a Guide for LLM Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Feedback (RLVF) has become a key technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, its reliance on sparse, outcome based rewards, which only indicate if a final answer is correct or not, fails to provide granular guidance on the reasoning process itself. This limitation hinders efficient learning, as the model cannot distinguish between high quality and inefficient solutions, nor can it learn effectively from different types of failures. To address this, we observe that an LLMs self-certainty often correlates with task difficulty and solution quality. We introduce Difficulty Aware Certainty guided Exploration (DACE), a novel RL algorithm that leverages this insight to dynamically balance the exploration exploitation trade-off. DACE assesses task difficulty online based on the policys success rate. It then uses this signal to modulate an intrinsic reward: for difficult tasks where the model is struggling, DACE encourages exploration by penalizing high certainty; for easier tasks, it encourages learning efficiency by rewarding high certainty. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH) show that DACE significantly outperforms strong baselines. The DACE-trained models not only achieve higher accuracy but also demonstrate more robust performance when scaling test-time compute, validating that our adaptive approach fosters effective exploration without sacrificing precision.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Health Coverage in Ethiopia: A Learning-augmented Approach and Persistent Proportionality Under an Online Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of nationwide efforts aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 3 on Universal Health Coverage, Ethiopia's Ministry of Health is strengthening health posts to expand access to essential healthcare services. However, only a fraction of this health system strengthening effort can be implemented each year due to limited budgets and other competing priorities, thus the need for an optimization framework to guide prioritization across the regions of Ethiopia. In this paper, we develop a tool, Health Access Resource Planner (HARP), based on a principled decision-support optimization framework for sequential facility planning that aims to maximize population coverage under budget uncertainty while satisfying region-specific proportionality targets at every time step. We then propose two algorithms: (i) a learning-augmented approach that improves upon expert recommendations at any single-step; and (ii) a greedy algorithm for multi-step planning, both with strong worst-case approximation estimation. In collaboration with the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we demonstrated the empirical efficacy of our method on three regions across various planning scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study notions of (virtual) group knowledge and group belief within multi-agent evidence models, obtained by extending the topological semantics of evidence-based belief and fallible knowledge from individuals to groups. We completely axiomatize and show the decidability of the logic of ("hard" and "soft") group evidence, and do the same for an especially interesting fragment of it: the logic of group knowledge and group belief. We also extend these languages with dynamic evidence-sharing operators, and completely axiomatize the corresponding logics, showing that they are co-expressive with their static bases.</description>

      <title>HiVA: Self-organized Hierarchical Variable Agent via Goal-driven Semantic-Topological Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous agents play a crucial role in advancing Artificial General Intelligence, enabling problem decomposition and tool orchestration through Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing paradigms face a critical trade-off. On one hand, reusable fixed workflows require manual reconfiguration upon environmental changes; on the other hand, flexible reactive loops fail to distill reasoning progress into transferable structures. We introduce Hierarchical Variable Agent (HiVA), a novel framework modeling agentic workflows as self-organized graphs with the Semantic-Topological Evolution (STEV) algorithm, which optimizes hybrid semantic-topological spaces using textual gradients as discrete-domain surrogates for backpropagation. The iterative process comprises Multi-Armed Bandit-infused forward routing, diagnostic gradient generation from environmental feedback, and coordinated updates that co-evolve individual semantics and topology for collective optimization in unknown environments. Experiments on dialogue, coding, Long-context Q&amp;A, mathematical, and agentic benchmarks demonstrate improvements of 5-10% in task accuracy and enhanced resource efficiency over existing baselines, establishing HiVA's effectiveness in autonomous task execution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep research tools are among the most impactful and most commonly encountered agentic systems today. We observe, however, that each deep research agent introduced so far is hard-coded to carry out a particular research strategy using a fixed choice of tools. We introduce Universal Deep Research (UDR), a generalist agentic system that wraps around any language model and enables the user to create, edit, and refine their own entirely custom deep research strategies without any need for additional training or finetuning. To showcase the generality of our system, we equip UDR with example minimal, expansive, and intensive research strategies, and provide a user interface to facilitate experimentation with the system.</description>

      <title>Instruction-Level Weight Shaping: A Framework for Self-Improving AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are fluent but largely static after pre-training; new or shifting knowledge is typically added with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or fine-tuning. RAG raises latency and engineering overhead and often fails to integrate facts; prompt engineering is brittle and can conflict with prior knowledge; fine-tuning is costly and risks catastrophic forgetting. We propose Instruction-Level Weight Shaping (ILWS): curated system instructions act as external, auditable pseudo-parameters updated after each session via reflection and user feedback. A Reflection Engine inspects conversation traces, diagnoses reasoning successes and failures, and proposes typed deltas $\Delta K=(\Delta S,\Delta U,\Delta T)$ over instructions, user preferences, and tools. Deltas are version-controlled, evaluated with a sliding window of 1-5 star ratings, auto-repaired on first failure, and rolled back on repeated failure. When an edit budget crosses a threshold, the agent compiles a rating-weighted synthetic set and distills matured instruction-space gains into parameters, converting prompt-space improvements into weight-space without downtime. ILWS makes explicit the low-rank shaping induced by context in transformer blocks, preserves governance, and removes per-call retrieval. In enterprise support it increased throughput 2.4-5.0x and cut audited hallucinations by about 80% versus a frozen baseline. In an Adobe Commerce Cloud proof of concept "L0 Support", it achieved 4-5x more tickets per hour and about 80% lower time per ticket, with autonomous instruction updates and optional tool synthesis. Because ILWS operates at the instruction layer until controlled distillation, it generalizes to dynamic domains (legal, medical, engineering) requiring adaptive reasoning, tool creation, and low-latency deployment.</description>

      <title>SHERPA: A Model-Driven Framework for Large Language Model Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved widespread application across various fields. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs suffer from a lack of structured reasoning ability, particularly for complex tasks requiring domain-specific best practices, which are often unavailable in the training data. Although multi-step prompting methods incorporating human best practices, such as chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought, have gained popularity, they lack a general mechanism to control LLM behavior. In this paper, we propose SHERPA, a model-driven framework to improve the LLM performance on complex tasks by explicitly incorporating domain-specific best practices into hierarchical state machines. By structuring the LLM execution processes using state machines, SHERPA enables more fine-grained control over their behavior via rules or decisions driven by machine learning-based approaches, including LLMs. We show that SHERPA is applicable to a wide variety of tasks-specifically, code generation, class name generation, and question answering-replicating previously proposed approaches while further improving the performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SHERPA for the aforementioned tasks using various LLMs. Our systematic evaluation compares different state machine configurations against baseline approaches without state machines. Results show that integrating well-designed state machines significantly improves the quality of LLM outputs, and is particularly beneficial for complex tasks with well-established human best practices but lacking data used for training LLMs.</description>

      <title>SIGMUS: Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal Urban Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern urban spaces are equipped with an increasingly diverse set of sensors, all producing an abundance of multimodal data. Such multimodal data can be used to identify and reason about important incidents occurring in urban landscapes, such as major emergencies, cultural and social events, as well as natural disasters. However, such data may be fragmented over several sources and difficult to integrate due to the reliance on human-driven reasoning for identifying relationships between the multimodal data corresponding to an incident, as well as understanding the different components which define an incident. Such relationships and components are critical to identifying the causes of such incidents, as well as producing forecasting the scale and intensity of future incidents as they begin to develop. In this work, we create SIGMUS, a system for Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal Urban Spaces. SIGMUS uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce the necessary world knowledge for identifying relationships between incidents occurring in urban spaces and data from different modalities, allowing us to organize evidence and observations relevant to an incident without relying and human-encoded rules for relating multimodal sensory data with incidents. This organized knowledge is represented as a knowledge graph, organizing incidents, observations, and much more. We find that our system is able to produce reasonable connections between 5 different data sources (new article text, CCTV images, air quality, weather, and traffic measurements) and relevant incidents occurring at the same time and location.</description>

      <title>NEWSAGENT: Benchmarking Multimodal Agents as Journalists with Real-World Newswriting Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous digital agents from industry (e.g., Manus AI and Gemini's research mode) highlight potential for structured tasks by autonomous decision-making and task decomposition; however, it remains unclear to what extent the agent-based systems can improve multimodal web data productivity. We study this in the realm of journalism, which requires iterative planning, interpretation, and contextual reasoning from multimodal raw contents to form a well structured news. We introduce NEWSAGENT, a benchmark for evaluating how agents can automatically search available raw contents, select desired information, and edit and rephrase to form a news article by accessing core journalistic functions. Given a writing instruction and firsthand data as how a journalist initiates a news draft, agents are tasked to identify narrative perspectives, issue keyword-based queries, retrieve historical background, and generate complete articles. Unlike typical summarization or retrieval tasks, essential context is not directly available and must be actively discovered, reflecting the information gaps faced in real-world news writing. NEWSAGENT includes 6k human-verified examples derived from real news, with multimodal contents converted to text for broad model compatibility. We evaluate open- and closed-sourced LLMs with commonly-used agentic frameworks on NEWSAGENT, which shows that agents are capable of retrieving relevant facts but struggling with planning and narrative integration. We believe that NEWSAGENT serves a realistic testbed for iterating and evaluating agent capabilities in terms of multimodal web data manipulation to real-world productivity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in the field of AI agents have impacted the way we work, enabling greater automation and collaboration between humans and agents. In the data visualization field, multi-agent systems can be useful for employing agents throughout the entire data-to-communication pipeline. We present a lightweight multi-agent system that automates the data analysis workflow, from data exploration to generating coherent visual narratives for insight communication. Our approach combines a hybrid multi-agent architecture with deterministic components, strategically externalizing critical logic from LLMs to improve transparency and reliability. The system delivers granular, modular outputs that enable surgical modifications without full regeneration, supporting sustainable human-AI collaboration. We evaluated our system across 4 diverse datasets, demonstrating strong generalizability, narrative quality, and computational efficiency with minimal dependencies.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence-Based Analysis of Ice Cream Melting Behavior Under Various Ingredients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of ice cream during melting is a critical factor for consumer's acceptance and product quality. With the commonly added stabilizer to improve texture, structure and slower melting as the factors to analyze. This report explores the effects of locust bean gum, guar gum, maltodextrin, and carrageenan on the melting behavior of homemade ice cream. The main objective was to assess how these additives influence melting resistance and to identify a more cost-effective recipe formulation. Ice cream samples incorporating each additive were prepared and subjected to melting tests under controlled conditions. Timelapse recordings were used to capture and analyze the progression of melting over time. Python and OpenCV is used for process and analysis. Observations revealed that all samples retained a foam-like structure even after melting, suggesting the stabilizers contributed to the formation of a stable air-cell matrix. Furthermore, when the melted samples were re-frozen and subsequently melted again, they displayed increased sturdiness, indicating improved resilience of the ice cream structure. Comparative analysis of the different stabilizers highlighted variations in their effectiveness, with some offering stronger melting resistance and structural support than others. Overall, the findings provide insights into the functional roles of commonly used food additives in ice cream formulation. By evaluating both performance and cost, this study demonstrates the potential for developing recipes that balance durability with economic efficiency, contributing to practical applications in both small-scale and commercial ice cream production.</description>

      <title>LLM-Assisted Iterative Evolution with Swarm Intelligence Toward SuperBrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel SuperBrain framework for collective intelligence, grounded in the co-evolution of large language models (LLMs) and human users. Unlike static prompt engineering or isolated agent simulations, our approach emphasizes a dynamic pathway from Subclass Brain to Superclass Brain: (1) A Subclass Brain arises from persistent, personalized interaction between a user and an LLM, forming a cognitive dyad with adaptive learning memory. (2) Through GA-assisted forward-backward evolution, these dyads iteratively refine prompts and task performance. (3) Multiple Subclass Brains coordinate via Swarm Intelligence, optimizing across multi-objective fitness landscapes and exchanging distilled heuristics. (4) Their standardized behaviors and cognitive signatures integrate into a Superclass Brain, an emergent meta-intelligence capable of abstraction, generalization and self-improvement. We outline the theoretical constructs, present initial implementations (e.g., UAV scheduling, KU/KI keyword filtering) and propose a registry for cross-dyad knowledge consolidation. This work provides both a conceptual foundation and an architectural roadmap toward scalable, explainable and ethically aligned collective AI.</description>

      <title>Text-to-Layout: A Generative Workflow for Drafting Architectural Floor Plans Using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of an AI-powered workflow that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in drafting schematic architectural floor plans from natural language prompts. The proposed system interprets textual input to automatically generate layout options including walls, doors, windows, and furniture arrangements. It combines prompt engineering, a furniture placement refinement algorithm, and Python scripting to produce spatially coherent draft plans compatible with design tools such as Autodesk Revit. A case study of a mid-sized residential layout demonstrates the approach's ability to generate functional and structured outputs with minimal manual effort. The workflow is designed for transparent replication, with all key prompt specifications documented to enable independent implementation by other researchers. In addition, the generated models preserve the full range of Revit-native parametric attributes required for direct integration into professional BIM processes.</description>

      <title>Social World Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans intuitively navigate social interactions by simulating unspoken dynamics and reasoning about others' perspectives, even with limited information. In contrast, AI systems struggle to automatically structure and reason about these implicit social contexts. In this paper, we introduce a novel structured social world representation formalism (S3AP), designed to help AI systems reason more effectively about social dynamics. Following a POMDP-driven design, S3AP represents social interactions as structured tuples, such as state, observation, agent actions, and mental states, which can be automatically induced from free-form narratives or other inputs. We first show S3AP can help LLMs better understand social narratives across 5 social reasoning tasks (e.g., +51% improvement on FANToM's theory-of-mind reasoning with OpenAI's o1), reaching new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We then induce social world models from these structured representations, demonstrating their ability to predict future social dynamics and improve agent decision-making, yielding up to +18% improvement on the SOTOPIA social interaction benchmark. Our findings highlight the promise of S3AP as a powerful, general-purpose representation for social world states, enabling the development of more socially-aware systems that better navigate social interactions.</description>

      <title>BALM-TSF: Balanced Multimodal Alignment for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is a long-standing and highly challenging research topic. Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research has increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing textual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast discrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal architectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other, resulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address this modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting framework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw time series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive statistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt, producing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context alignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling strategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual embeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the aligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together integrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that, with minimal trainable parameters, BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art performance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting, confirming its ability to harness complementary information from text and time series. Code is available at https://github.com/ShiqiaoZhou/BALM-TSF.</description>

      <title>NetGent: Agent-Based Automation of Network Application Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present NetGent, an AI-agent framework for automating complex application workflows to generate realistic network traffic datasets. Developing generalizable ML models for networking requires data collection from network environments with traffic that results from a diverse set of real-world web applications. However, using existing browser automation tools that are diverse, repeatable, realistic, and efficient remains fragile and costly. NetGent addresses this challenge by allowing users to specify workflows as natural-language rules that define state-dependent actions. These abstract specifications are compiled into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs), which a state synthesis component translates into reusable, executable code. This design enables deterministic replay, reduces redundant LLM calls through state caching, and adapts quickly when application interfaces change. In experiments, NetGent automated more than 50+ workflows spanning video-on-demand streaming, live video streaming, video conferencing, social media, and web scraping, producing realistic traffic traces while remaining robust to UI variability. By combining the flexibility of language-based agents with the reliability of compiled execution, NetGent provides a scalable foundation for generating the diverse, repeatable datasets needed to advance ML in networking.</description>

      <title>On Verifiable Legal Reasoning: A Multi-Agent Framework with Formalized Knowledge Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legal reasoning requires both precise interpretation of statutory language and consistent application of complex rules, presenting significant challenges for AI systems. This paper introduces a modular multi-agent framework that decomposes legal reasoning into distinct knowledge acquisition and application stages. In the first stage, specialized agents extract legal concepts and formalize rules to create verifiable intermediate representations of statutes. The second stage applies this knowledge to specific cases through three steps: analyzing queries to map case facts onto the ontology schema, performing symbolic inference to derive logically entailed conclusions, and generating final answers using a programmatic implementation that operationalizes the ontological knowledge. This bridging of natural language understanding with symbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points, significantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches. Evaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial improvements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\% accuracy compared to 18.8\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between reasoning and foundational models. These findings suggest that modular architectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated legal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while enhancing consistency and explainability in AI legal reasoning, establishing a foundation for future research into more transparent, trustworthy, and effective AI systems for legal domain.</description>

      <title>OmniDPO: A Preference Optimization Framework to Address Omni-Modal Hallucination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) have sparked a new wave of research, achieving impressive results in tasks such as audio-video understanding and real-time environment perception. However, hallucination issues still persist. Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text modality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues while neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal scenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or auditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the intrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This oversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden audio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose OmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations in OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing text-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of audio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample pairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information. By tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding and reduces hallucination. Experiments conducted on two OLLMs demonstrate that OmniDPO not only effectively mitigates multimodal hallucinations but also significantly enhances the models' reasoning capabilities across modalities. All code and datasets will be released upon paper acceptance.</description>

      <title>Efficient Graph Understanding with LLMs via Structured Context Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in solving problems across domains, including graph-related tasks traditionally addressed by symbolic or algorithmic methods. In this work, we present a framework for structured context injection, where task-specific information is systematically embedded in the input to guide LLMs in solving a wide range of graph problems. Our method does not require fine-tuning of LLMs, making it cost-efficient and lightweight. We observe that certain graph reasoning tasks remain challenging for LLMs unless they are mapped to conceptually grounded representations. However, achieving such mappings through fine-tuning or repeated multi-step querying can be expensive and inefficient. Our approach offers a practical alternative by injecting structured context directly into the input, enabling the LLM to implicitly align the task with grounded conceptual spaces. We evaluate the approach on multiple graph tasks using both lightweight and large models, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost. The results demonstrate consistent performance improvements, showing that structured input context can rival or surpass more complex approaches. Our findings underscore the value of structured context injection as an effective and scalable strategy for graph understanding with LLMs.</description>

      <title>L-MARS -- Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and Agentic Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present L-MARS (Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and Agentic Search), a system that reduces hallucination and uncertainty in legal question answering through coordinated multi-agent reasoning and retrieval. Unlike single-pass retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), L-MARS decomposes queries into subproblems, issues targeted searches across heterogeneous sources (Serper web, local RAG, CourtListener case law), and employs a Judge Agent to verify sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before answer synthesis. This iterative reasoning-search-verification loop maintains coherence, filters noisy evidence, and grounds answers in authoritative law. We evaluated L-MARS on LegalSearchQA, a new benchmark of 200 up-to-date multiple choice legal questions in 2025. Results show that L-MARS substantially improves factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores from both human experts and LLM-based judges. Our work demonstrates that multi-agent reasoning with agentic search offers a scalable and reproducible blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains requiring precise legal retrieval and deliberation.</description>

      <title>Aligning Reasoning LLMs for Materials Discovery with Physics-aware Rejection Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets, with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.</description>

      <title>Sharpe Ratio Optimization in Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sharpe ratio (also known as reward-to-variability ratio) is a widely-used metric in finance, which measures the additional return at the cost of per unit of increased risk (standard deviation of return). However, the optimization of Sharpe ratio in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is challenging, because there exist two difficulties hindering the application of dynamic programming. One is that dynamic programming does not work for fractional objectives, and the other is that dynamic programming is invalid for risk metrics. In this paper, we study the Sharpe ratio optimization in infinite-horizon MDPs, considering both the long-run average and discounted settings. We address the first challenge with the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a mean-squared-variance (M2V) objective. It is shown that the M2V optimization and the original Sharpe ratio optimization share the same optimal policy when the risk-sensitive parameter is equal to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For the second challenge, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the M2V optimization which is similar to a mean-variance optimization in MDPs. We iteratively solve the M2V problem and obtain the associated Sharpe ratio that is used to update the risk-sensitive parameter in the next iteration of M2V problems. We show that such a sequence of Sharpe ratios derived is monotonically increasing and converges to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For both average and discounted MDP settings, we develop a policy iteration procedure and prove its convergence to the optimum. Numerical experiments are conducted for validation. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that solves the Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs with dynamic programming type algorithms. We believe that the proposed algorithm can shed light on solving MDPs with other fractional objectives.</description>

      <title>Neuro-Symbolic Predictive Process Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of suffix prediction in Business Process Management (BPM) by proposing a Neuro-Symbolic Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) approach that integrates data-driven learning with temporal logic-based prior knowledge. While recent approaches leverage deep learning models for suffix prediction, they often fail to satisfy even basic logical constraints due to the absence of explicit integration of domain knowledge during training. We propose a novel method to incorporate Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) into the training process of autoregressive sequence predictors. Our approach introduces a differentiable logical loss function, defined using a soft approximation of LTLf semantics and the Gumbel-Softmax trick, which can be combined with standard predictive losses. This ensures the model learns to generate suffixes that are both accurate and logically consistent. Experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets shows that our method improves suffix prediction accuracy and compliance with temporal constraints. We also introduce two variants of the logic loss (local and global) and demonstrate their effectiveness under noisy and realistic settings. While developed in the context of BPM, our framework is applicable to any symbolic sequence generation task and contributes toward advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI.</description>

      <title>ChatCLIDS: Simulating Persuasive AI Dialogues to Promote Closed-Loop Insulin Adoption in Type 1 Diabetes Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems (CLIDS) in type 1 diabetes remains low, driven not by technical failure, but by diverse behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers. We introduce ChatCLIDS, the first benchmark to rigorously evaluate LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for health behavior change. Our framework features a library of expert-validated virtual patients, each with clinically grounded, heterogeneous profiles and realistic adoption barriers, and simulates multi-turn interactions with nurse agents equipped with a diverse set of evidence-based persuasive strategies. ChatCLIDS uniquely supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social influence scenarios, enabling robust, multi-dimensional evaluation. Our findings reveal that while larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies over time, all models struggle to overcome resistance, especially under realistic social pressure. These results highlight critical limitations of current LLMs for behavior change, and offer a high-fidelity, scalable testbed for advancing trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare and beyond.</description>

      <title>Robust Deep Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization: Addressing Theoretical Risks in Neural Fictitious Self-Play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR) has emerged as a cornerstone algorithm for solving extensive-form games, but its integration with deep neural networks introduces scale-dependent challenges that manifest differently across game complexities. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of how neural MCCFR component effectiveness varies with game scale and proposes an adaptive framework for selective component deployment. We identify that theoretical risks such as nonstationary target distribution shifts, action support collapse, variance explosion, and warm-starting bias have scale-dependent manifestation patterns, requiring different mitigation strategies for small versus large games. Our proposed Robust Deep MCCFR framework incorporates target networks with delayed updates, uniform exploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and comprehensive diagnostic monitoring. Through systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc Poker, we demonstrate scale-dependent component effectiveness and identify critical component interactions. The best configuration achieves final exploitability of 0.0628 on Kuhn Poker, representing a 60% improvement over the classical framework (0.156). On the more complex Leduc Poker domain, selective component usage achieves exploitability of 0.2386, a 23.5% improvement over the classical framework (0.3703) and highlighting the importance of careful component selection over comprehensive mitigation. Our contributions include: (1) a formal theoretical analysis of risks in neural MCCFR, (2) a principled mitigation framework with convergence guarantees, (3) comprehensive multi-scale experimental validation revealing scale-dependent component interactions, and (4) practical guidelines for deployment in larger games.</description>

      <title>SATQuest: A Verifier for Logical Reasoning Evaluation and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable general reasoning capabilities. However, systematically evaluating and enhancing these reasoning capabilities is challenging due to the lack of controllable and scalable tools for fine-grained analysis. Existing benchmarks and datasets often lack the necessary variable control for multi-dimensional, systematic analysis and training, or have narrow problem types and formats. To address these limitations, we introduce SATQuest, a systematic verifier designed to evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs by generating diverse, Satisfiability-based logical reasoning problems directly from Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) instances. SATQuest structures these problems along three orthogonal dimensions: instance scale, problem type, and question format, employing randomized, SAT-based problem generation and objective answer verification via PySAT. This design mitigates memorization issues, allows for nuanced insights into reasoning performance, and enables effective reinforcement fine-tuning. Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using SATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning, particularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement fine-tuning with SATQuest rewards substantially improves targeted task performance and generalizes to more complex instances, while highlighting remaining challenges in cross-format adaptation. Through these demonstrations, we showcase SATQuest's potential as a foundational tool and a valuable starting point for advancing LLM logical reasoning.</description>

      <title>UrbanInsight: A Distributed Edge Computing Framework with LLM-Powered Data Filtering for Smart City Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cities today generate enormous streams of data from sensors, cameras, and connected infrastructure. While this information offers unprecedented opportunities to improve urban life, most existing systems struggle with scale, latency, and fragmented insights. This work introduces a framework that blends physics-informed machine learning, multimodal data fusion, and knowledge graph representation with adaptive, rule-based intelligence powered by large language models (LLMs). Physics-informed methods ground learning in real-world constraints, ensuring predictions remain meaningful and consistent with physical dynamics. Knowledge graphs act as the semantic backbone, integrating heterogeneous sensor data into a connected, queryable structure. At the edge, LLMs generate context-aware rules that adapt filtering and decision-making in real time, enabling efficient operation even under constrained resources. Together, these elements form a foundation for digital twin systems that go beyond passive monitoring to provide actionable insights. By uniting physics-based reasoning, semantic data fusion, and adaptive rule generation, this approach opens new possibilities for creating responsive, trustworthy, and sustainable smart infrastructures.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Ai Framework For Strategic Patent Portfolio Pruning: Integrating Learning To-Rank And Market Need Analysis For Technology Transfer Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, multi stage hybrid intelligence framework for pruning patent portfolios to identify high value assets for technology transfer. Current patent valuation methods often rely on retrospective indicators or manual, time intensive analysis. Our framework automates and deepens this process by combining a Learning to Rank (LTR) model, which evaluates patents against over 30 legal and commercial parameters, with a unique "Need-Seed" agent-based system. The "Need Agent" uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to mine unstructured market and industry data, identifying explicit technological needs. Concurrently, the "Seed Agent" employs fine tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze patent claims and map their technological capabilities. The system generates a "Core Ontology Framework" that matches high potential patents (Seeds) to documented market demands (Needs), providing a strategic rationale for divestment decisions. We detail the architecture, including a dynamic parameter weighting system and a crucial Human in the-Loop (HITL) validation protocol, to ensure both adaptability and real-world credibility.</description>

      <title>Ultra Strong Machine Learning: Teaching Humans Active Learning Strategies via Automated AI Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra Strong Machine Learning (USML) refers to symbolic learning systems that not only improve their own performance but can also teach their acquired knowledge to quantifiably improve human performance. In this work, we present LENS (Logic Programming Explanation via Neural Summarisation), a neuro-symbolic method that combines symbolic program synthesis with large language models (LLMs) to automate the explanation of machine-learned logic programs in natural language. LENS addresses a key limitation of prior USML approaches by replacing hand-crafted explanation templates with scalable automated generation. Through systematic evaluation using multiple LLM judges and human validation, we demonstrate that LENS generates superior explanations compared to direct LLM prompting and hand-crafted templates. To investigate whether LENS can teach transferable active learning strategies, we carried out a human learning experiment across three related domains. Our results show no significant human performance improvements, suggesting that comprehensive LLM responses may overwhelm users for simpler problems rather than providing learning support. Our work provides a solid foundation for building effective USML systems to support human learning. The source code is available on: https://github.com/lun-ai/LENS.git.</description>

      <title>CoreThink: A Symbolic Reasoning Layer to reason over Long Horizon Tasks with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce CoreThink, a state-of-the-art Reasoning Layer built upon a novel reasoning method called General Symbolics. This approach diverges from reasoning paradigms such as test-time scaling, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). CoreThink General Symbolic Reasoner (GSR) is specifically structured around three key use cases: tool-calling, code generation, and planning, demonstrating exemplary performance across a total of seven benchmarks in their respective areas. Notably, we are achieving SOTA scores of 66.66\% on Livecodebench v6, 89\% on Instruction-Following Evals, and 24.4\% on ARC-AGI-2. We also present an agentic coding IDE, developed using the principles of General Symbolics, which achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.3\% on \texttt{SWE-Bench Lite}. We are able to achieve these improvements without any finetuning or training costs. Our Reasoning Layer is designed to provide a pure performance uplift, ensuring that a model's accuracy on reasoning tasks is never negatively impacted. We argue that incumbent methods will eventually lead to diminishing returns in LLM performance, necessitating the development of new reasoning techniques. This technical report details our approach at a high level and the availability of the CoreThink models for reasoning-intensive use cases.</description>

      <title>Self-Exploring Language Models for Explainable Link Forecasting on Temporal Graphs via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning, requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones. Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs. ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.</description>

      <title>Causal MAS: A Survey of Large Language Model Architectures for Discovery and Effect Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various reasoning and generation tasks. However, their proficiency in complex causal reasoning, discovery, and estimation remains an area of active development, often hindered by issues like hallucination, reliance on spurious correlations, and difficulties in handling nuanced, domain-specific, or personalized causal relationships. Multi-agent systems, leveraging the collaborative or specialized abilities of multiple LLM-based agents, are emerging as a powerful paradigm to address these limitations. This review paper explores the burgeoning field of causal multi-agent LLMs. We examine how these systems are designed to tackle different facets of causality, including causal reasoning and counterfactual analysis, causal discovery from data, and the estimation of causal effects. We delve into the diverse architectural patterns and interaction protocols employed, from pipeline-based processing and debate frameworks to simulation environments and iterative refinement loops. Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation methodologies, benchmarks, and diverse application domains where causal multi-agent LLMs are making an impact, including scientific discovery, healthcare, fact-checking, and personalized systems. Finally, we highlight the persistent challenges, open research questions, and promising future directions in this synergistic field, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of its current state and potential trajectory.</description>

      <title>Supporting Our AI Overlords: Redesigning Data Systems to be Agent-First</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, acting on their users' behalf to manipulate and analyze data, are likely to become the dominant workload for data systems in the future. When working with data, agents employ a high-throughput process of exploration and solution formulation for the given task, one we call agentic speculation. The sheer volume and inefficiencies of agentic speculation can pose challenges for present-day data systems. We argue that data systems need to adapt to more natively support agentic workloads. We take advantage of the characteristics of agentic speculation that we identify, i.e., scale, heterogeneity, redundancy, and steerability - to outline a number of new research opportunities for a new agent-first data systems architecture, ranging from new query interfaces, to new query processing techniques, to new agentic memory stores.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Error Sources in LLM-based Hypothesis Search for Few-Shot Rule Induction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inductive reasoning enables humans to infer abstract rules from limited examples and apply them to novel situations. In this work, we compare an LLM-based hypothesis search framework with direct program generation approaches on few-shot rule induction tasks. Our findings show that hypothesis search achieves performance comparable to humans, while direct program generation falls notably behind. An error analysis reveals key bottlenecks in hypothesis generation and suggests directions for advancing program induction methods. Overall, this paper underscores the potential of LLM-based hypothesis search for modeling inductive reasoning and the challenges in building more efficient systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum-like Coherence Derived from the Interaction between Chemical Reaction and Its Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By uncovering the contrast between Artificial Intelligence and Natural-born Intelligence as a computational process, we define closed computing and open computing, and implement open computing within chemical reactions. This involves forming a mixture and invalidation of the computational process and the execution environment, which are logically distinct, and coalescing both to create a system that adjusts fluctuations. We model chemical reactions by considering the computation as the chemical reaction and the execution environment as the degree of aggregation of molecules that interact with the reactive environment. This results in a chemical reaction that progresses while repeatedly clustering and de-clustering, where concentration no longer holds significant meaning. Open computing is segmented into Token computing, which focuses on the individual behavior of chemical molecules, and Type computing, which focuses on normative behavior. Ultimately, both are constructed as an interplay between the two. In this system, Token computing demonstrates self-organizing critical phenomena, while Type computing exhibits quantum logic. Through their interplay, the recruitment of fluctuations is realized, giving rise to interactions between quantum logical subspaces corresponding to quantum coherence across different Hilbert spaces. As a result, spike waves are formed, enabling signal transmission. This occurrence may be termed quantum-like coherence, implying the source of enzymes responsible for controlling spike waves and biochemical rhythms.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Planning and Multi-Agent Path Finding in Extremely Dense Environments with Movable Obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Block Rearrangement Problem (BRaP), a challenging component of large warehouse management which involves rearranging storage blocks within dense grids to achieve a target state. We formally define the BRaP as a graph search problem. Building on intuitions from sliding puzzle problems, we propose five search-based solution algorithms, leveraging joint configuration space search, classical planning, multi-agent pathfinding, and expert heuristics. We evaluate the five approaches empirically for plan quality and scalability. Despite the exponential relation between search space size and block number, our methods demonstrate efficiency in creating rearrangement plans for deeply buried blocks in up to 80x80 grids.</description>

      <title>FlashAdventure: A Benchmark for GUI Agents Solving Full Story Arcs in Diverse Adventure Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts to narrow this divide.</description>

      <title>VerlTool: Towards Holistic Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Tool Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video), extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool.</description>

      <title>Robix: A Unified Model for Robot Interaction, Reasoning and Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3) reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery shopping, and dietary filtering.</description>

      <title>Heads or Tails: A Simple Example of Causal Abstractive Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note illustrates how a variety of causal abstraction arXiv:1707.00819 arXiv:1812.03789, defined here as causal abstractive simulation, can be used to formalize a simple example of language model simulation. This note considers the case of simulating a fair coin toss with a language model. Examples are presented illustrating the ways language models can fail to simulate, and a success case is presented, illustrating how this formalism may be used to prove that a language model simulates some other system, given a causal description of the system. This note may be of interest to three groups. For practitioners in the growing field of language model simulation, causal abstractive simulation is a means to connect ad-hoc statistical benchmarking practices to the solid formal foundation of causality. Philosophers of AI and philosophers of mind may be interested as causal abstractive simulation gives a precise operationalization to the idea that language models are role-playing arXiv:2402.12422. Mathematicians and others working on causal abstraction may be interested to see a new application of the core ideas that yields a new variation of causal abstraction.</description>

      <title>Question-to-Knowledge: Multi-Agent Generation of Inspectable Facts for Product Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) is a persistent challenge in ecommerce, especially when explicit identifiers are missing and product names vary widely across platforms. Rule based heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by overlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle configuration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge (Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for reliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle identification and brand origin disambiguation. By reusing retrieved reasoning instead of issuing repeated searches, Q2K balances accuracy with efficiency, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration.</description>

      <title>Towards Open-World Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Knowledge Graph: A Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in language understanding and reasoning. However, their dependence on static training corpora makes them prone to factual errors and knowledge gaps. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating external knowledge sources, especially structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which provide explicit semantics and efficient retrieval. Existing KG-based RAG approaches, however, generally assume that anchor entities are accessible to initiate graph traversal, which limits their robustness in open world settings where accurate linking between the query and the entity is unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we propose AnchorRAG, a novel multi-agent collaboration framework for open-world RAG without the predefined anchor entities. Specifically, a predictor agent dynamically identifies candidate anchor entities by aligning user query terms with KG nodes and initializes independent retriever agents to conduct parallel multi-hop explorations from each candidate. Then a supervisor agent formulates the iterative retrieval strategy for these retriever agents and synthesizes the resulting knowledge paths to generate the final answer. This multi-agent collaboration framework improves retrieval robustness and mitigates the impact of ambiguous or erroneous anchors. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate that AnchorRAG significantly outperforms existing baselines and establishes new state-of-the-art results on the real-world question answering tasks.</description>

      <title>Towards Agentic OS: An LLM Agent Framework for Linux Schedulers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operating system schedulers suffer from a fundamental semantic gap, where kernel policies fail to understand application-specific needs, leading to suboptimal performance. We introduce SchedCP, the first framework that enables fully autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to safely and efficiently optimize Linux schedulers without human involvement. Our core insight is that the challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled control plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning ("what to optimize") from the system's role of execution ("how to observe and act"). Implemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable interface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving Scheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all AI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic analysis.
  We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent system that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling policies, and deploys them via the sched\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation shows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high success rate. By bridging the semantic gap, SchedCP democratizes expert-level system optimization and represents a step towards creating truly self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems.

      <title>Communicative Agents for Slideshow Storytelling Video Generation based on LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), the proliferation of AI-generated content (AIGC) tasks has significantly accelerated developments in text-to-video generation. As a result, the field of video production is undergoing a transformative shift. However, conventional text-to-video models are typically constrained by high computational costs.
  In this study, we propose Video-Generation-Team (VGTeam), a novel slide show video generation system designed to redefine the video creation pipeline through the integration of large language models (LLMs). VGTeam is composed of a suite of communicative agents, each responsible for a distinct aspect of video generation, such as scriptwriting, scene creation, and audio design. These agents operate collaboratively within a chat tower workflow, transforming user-provided textual prompts into coherent, slide-style narrative videos.
  By emulating the sequential stages of traditional video production, VGTeam achieves remarkable improvements in both efficiency and scalability, while substantially reducing computational overhead. On average, the system generates videos at a cost of only $0.103, with a successful generation rate of 98.4%. Importantly, this framework maintains a high degree of creative fidelity and customization.
  The implications of VGTeam are far-reaching. It democratizes video production by enabling broader access to high-quality content creation without the need for extensive resources. Furthermore, it highlights the transformative potential of language models in creative domains and positions VGTeam as a pioneering system for next-generation content creation.</description>

      <title>GradeSQL: Outcome Reward Models for Ranking SQL Queries from Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL queries, has significantly advanced with the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs), broadening database accessibility for a wide range of users. Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still struggle with complex queries that require precise alignment between user intent and the database schema. To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the assumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting either the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or the most frequently generated query with Maj. Recently, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic correctness, have emerged as a promising approach for better aligning model predictions with user intent. Nevertheless, their application to Text-to-SQL remains largely underexplored.
  In this work, we evaluate ORMs as an effective heuristic for BoN, compare them with ex-BoN and Maj, and introduce a framework for training ORMs for the Text-to-SQL task. We evaluate our ORMs on the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks, finetuning various open-source LLMs, including the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3 model families. Our results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and +2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.</description>

      <title>Conformal Predictive Monitoring for Multi-Modal Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of quantitative predictive monitoring (QPM) of stochastic systems, i.e., predicting at runtime the degree of satisfaction of a desired temporal logic property from the current state of the system. Since computational efficiency is key to enable timely intervention against predicted violations, several state-of-the-art QPM approaches rely on fast machine-learning surrogates to provide prediction intervals for the satisfaction values, using conformal inference to offer statistical guarantees. However, these QPM methods suffer when the monitored agent exhibits multi-modal dynamics, whereby certain modes may yield high satisfaction values while others critically violate the property. Existing QPM methods are mode-agnostic and so would yield overly conservative and uninformative intervals that lack meaningful mode-specific satisfaction information. To address this problem, we present GenQPM, a method that leverages deep generative models, specifically score-based diffusion models, to reliably approximate the probabilistic and multi-modal system dynamics without requiring explicit model access. GenQPM employs a mode classifier to partition the predicted trajectories by dynamical mode. For each mode, we then apply conformal inference to produce statistically valid, mode-specific prediction intervals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GenQPM on a benchmark of agent navigation and autonomous driving tasks, resulting in prediction intervals that are significantly more informative (less conservative) than mode-agnostic baselines.</description>

      <title>Error Notebook-Guided, Training-Free Part Retrieval in 3D CAD Assemblies via Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective specification-aware part retrieval within complex CAD assemblies is essential for automated design verification and downstream engineering tasks. However, directly using LLMs/VLMs to this task presents some challenges: the input sequences may exceed model token limits, and even after processing, performance remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs/VLMs requires significant computational resources, and for many high-performing general-use proprietary models (e.g., GPT or Gemini), fine-tuning access is not available. In this paper, we propose a novel part retrieval framework that requires no extra training, but using Error Notebooks + RAG for refined prompt engineering to help improve the existing general model's retrieval performance. The construction of Error Notebooks consists of two steps: (1) collecting historical erroneous CoTs and their incorrect answers, and (2) connecting these CoTs through reflective corrections until the correct solutions are obtained. As a result, the Error Notebooks serve as a repository of tasks along with their corrected CoTs and final answers. RAG is then employed to retrieve specification-relevant records from the Error Notebooks and incorporate them into the inference process. Another major contribution of our work is a human-in-the-loop CAD dataset, which is used to evaluate our method. In addition, the engineering value of our novel framework lies in its ability to effectively handle 3D models with lengthy, non-natural language metadata. Experiments with proprietary models, including GPT-4o and the Gemini series, show substantial gains, with GPT-4o (Omni) achieving up to a 23.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the human preference dataset. Moreover, ablation studies confirm that CoT reasoning provides benefits especially in challenging cases with higher part counts (&gt;10).</description>

      <title>DeepResearch Arena: The First Exam of LLMs' Research Abilities via Seminar-Grounded Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep research agents have attracted growing attention for their potential to orchestrate multi-stage research workflows, spanning literature synthesis, methodological design, and empirical verification. Despite these strides, evaluating their research capability faithfully is rather challenging due to the difficulty of collecting frontier research questions that genuinely capture researchers' attention and intellectual curiosity. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch Arena, a benchmark grounded in academic seminars that capture rich expert discourse and interaction, better reflecting real-world research environments and reducing the risk of data leakage. To automatically construct DeepResearch Arena, we propose a Multi-Agent Hierarchical Task Generation (MAHTG) system that extracts research-worthy inspirations from seminar transcripts. The MAHTG system further translates research-worthy inspirations into high-quality research tasks, ensuring the traceability of research task formulation while filtering noise. With the MAHTG system, we curate DeepResearch Arena with over 10,000 high-quality research tasks from over 200 academic seminars, spanning 12 disciplines, such as literature, history, and science. Our extensive evaluation shows that DeepResearch Arena presents substantial challenges for current state-of-the-art agents, with clear performance gaps observed across different models.</description>

Machine learning and large language models (LLMs) can generate hypotheses at a scale and speed far exceeding traditional methods, offering the potential to accelerate discovery across diverse fields. However, the abundance of hypotheses introduces a critical challenge: without scalable and reliable mechanisms for verification, scientific progress risks being hindered rather than being advanced. In this article, we trace the historical development of scientific discovery, examine how AI is reshaping established practices for scientific discovery, and review the principal approaches, ranging from data-driven methods and knowledge-aware neural architectures to symbolic reasoning frameworks and LLM agents. While these systems can uncover patterns and propose candidate laws, their scientific value ultimately depends on rigorous and transparent verification, which we argue must be the cornerstone of AI-assisted discovery.</description>

      <title>LLM-empowered Agents Simulation Framework for Scenario Generation in Service Ecosystem Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the social environment is growing more complex and collaboration is deepening, factors affecting the healthy development of service ecosystem are constantly changing and diverse, making its governance a crucial research issue. Applying the scenario analysis method and conducting scenario rehearsals by constructing an experimental system before managers make decisions, losses caused by wrong decisions can be largely avoided. However, it relies on predefined rules to construct scenarios and faces challenges such as limited information, a large number of influencing factors, and the difficulty of measuring social elements. These challenges limit the quality and efficiency of generating social and uncertain scenarios for the service ecosystem. Therefore, we propose a scenario generator design method, which adaptively coordinates three Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents that autonomously optimize experimental schemes to construct an experimental system and generate high quality scenarios. Specifically, the Environment Agent (EA) generates social environment including extremes, the Social Agent (SA) generates social collaboration structure, and the Planner Agent (PA) couples task-role relationships and plans task solutions. These agents work in coordination, with the PA adjusting the experimental scheme in real time by perceiving the states of each agent and these generating scenarios. Experiments on the ProgrammableWeb dataset illustrate our method generates more accurate scenarios more efficiently, and innovatively provides an effective way for service ecosystem governance related experimental system construction.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Sensitivity for Faithful Reasoning in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce correct answers while relying on flawed or irrelevant reasoning traces, undermining their trustworthiness in high-stakes domains. We propose Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization (CSR), a lightweight training objective that enforces dependence between intermediate reasoning and final outputs. CSR introduces automated, operator-level counterfactual interventions (e.g., swapping "+" with "-") during training and penalizes models that preserve the same answer under logically invalid traces. This requires only one additional forward pass per sample. To measure faithfulness, we introduce Counterfactual Outcome Sensitivity (COS), which quantifies the impact of such perturbations on model predictions. Across structured reasoning tasks - arithmetic (GSM8K), logical deduction (PrOntoQA), and planning (Blocks World) - CSR improves faithfulness by up to 70 percentage points over standard fine-tuning and process supervision, with only minor accuracy loss. The learned sensitivity generalizes to larger models and synergizes with inference-time methods such as self-consistency. A pilot study on HellaSwag further demonstrates that extending CSR with semantic perturbations can enhance faithfulness in commonsense reasoning.</description>

      <title>Structured AI Decision-Making in Disaster Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With artificial intelligence (AI) being applied to bring autonomy to decision-making in safety-critical domains such as the ones typified in the aerospace and emergency-response services, there has been a call to address the ethical implications of structuring those decisions, so they remain reliable and justifiable when human lives are at stake. This paper contributes to addressing the challenge of decision-making by proposing a structured decision-making framework as a foundational step towards responsible AI. The proposed structured decision-making framework is implemented in autonomous decision-making, specifically within disaster management. By introducing concepts of Enabler agents, Levels and Scenarios, the proposed framework's performance is evaluated against systems relying solely on judgement-based insights, as well as human operators who have disaster experience: victims, volunteers, and stakeholders. The results demonstrate that the structured decision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently accurate decisions across multiple Scenarios, compared to judgement-based systems. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed framework outperforms human operators with a 38.93% higher accuracy across various Scenarios. These findings demonstrate the promise of the structured decision-making framework for building more reliable autonomous AI applications in safety-critical contexts.</description>

      <title>Throttling Web Agents Using Reasoning Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI web agents use Internet resources at far greater speed, scale, and complexity -- changing how users and services interact. Deployed maliciously or erroneously, these agents could overload content providers. At the same time, web agents can bypass CAPTCHAs and other defenses by mimicking user behavior or flood authentication systems with fake accounts. Yet providers must protect their services and content from denial-of-service attacks and scraping by web agents. In this paper, we design a framework that imposes tunable costs on agents before providing access to resources; we call this Web Agent Throttling. We start by formalizing Throttling Gates as challenges issued to an agent that are asymmetric, scalable, robust, and compatible with any agent. Focusing on a common component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve reasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However, we find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates fails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based Reasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over world knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable generation and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework achieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x higher than the generation cost for SOTA models. We further deploy reasoning gates on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and evaluate with real-world web agents. Finally, we discuss the limitations and environmental impact of real-world deployment of our framework.</description>

      <title>Unraveling LLM Jailbreaks Through Safety Knowledge Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting attention in various applications. Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to exploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of controlled substances and the propagation of disinformation, a technique known as "Jailbreak." While some studies have achieved defenses against jailbreak attacks by modifying output distributions or detecting harmful content, the exact rationale still remains elusive. In this work, we present a novel neuron-level interpretability method that focuses on the role of safety-related knowledge neurons. Unlike existing approaches, our method projects the model's internal representation into a more consistent and interpretable vocabulary space. We then show that adjusting the activation of safety-related neurons can effectively control the model's behavior with a mean ASR higher than 97%. Building on this insight, we propose SafeTuning, a fine-tuning strategy that reinforces safety-critical neurons to improve model robustness against jailbreaks. SafeTuning consistently reduces attack success rates across multiple LLMs and outperforms all four baseline defenses. These findings offer a new perspective on understanding and defending against jailbreak attacks.</description>

      <title>Physics Supernova: AI Agent Matches Elite Gold Medalists at IPhO 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics provides fundamental laws that describe and predict the natural world. AI systems aspiring toward more general, real-world intelligence must therefore demonstrate strong physics problem-solving abilities: to formulate and apply physical laws for explaining and predicting physical processes. The International Physics Olympiad (IPhO)--the world's most prestigious physics competition--offers a rigorous benchmark for this purpose. We introduce Physics Supernova, an AI agent system with superior physics problem-solving abilities that match elite IPhO gold medalists. In IPhO 2025 theory problems, Physics Supernova attains 23.5/30 points, ranking 14th of 406 contestants and surpassing the median performance of human gold medalists. We extensively analyzed Physics Supernova's capabilities and flexibility across diverse physics tasks. These results show that principled tool integration within agent systems can deliver competitive improvements in solving challenging science problems. The codes are available at https://github.com/CharlesQ9/Physics-Supernova.</description>

      <title>An LLM-enabled semantic-centric framework to consume privacy policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites, despite claiming otherwise, due to the practical difficulty in comprehending them. The mist of data privacy practices forms a major barrier for user-centred Web approaches, and for data sharing and reusing in an agentic world. Existing research proposed methods for using formal languages and reasoning for verifying the compliance of a specified policy, as a potential cure for ignoring privacy policies. However, a critical gap remains in the creation or acquisition of such formal policies at scale. We present a semantic-centric approach for using state-of-the-art large language models (LLM), to automatically identify key information about privacy practices from privacy policies, and construct $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$, knowledge graph with grounding from Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) for privacy practices, to support downstream tasks. Along with the pipeline, the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ for the top-100 popular websites is also released as a public resource, by using the pipeline for analysis. We also demonstrate how the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ can be used to support downstream tasks by constructing formal policy representations such as Open Digital Right Language (ODRL) or perennial semantic Data Terms of Use (psDToU). To evaluate the technology capability, we enriched the Policy-IE dataset by employing legal experts to create custom annotations. We benchmarked the performance of different large language models for our pipeline and verified their capabilities. Overall, they shed light on the possibility of large-scale analysis of online services' privacy practices, as a promising direction to audit the Web and the Internet. We release all datasets and source code as public resources to facilitate reuse and improvement.</description>

      <title>Oyster-I: Beyond Refusal -- Constructive Safety Alignment for Responsible Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically deploy safety mechanisms to prevent harmful content generation. Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks posed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and relying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come from non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g., self-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat, escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process. Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high general capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong constructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels. By shifting from refusal-first to guidance-first safety, CSA redefines the model-user relationship, aiming for systems that are not just safe, but meaningfully helpful. We release Oy1, code, and the benchmark to support responsible, user-centered AI.</description>

      <title>How Real Is AI Tutoring? Comparing Simulated and Human Dialogues in One-on-One Instruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heuristic and scaffolded teacher-student dialogues are widely regarded as critical for fostering students' higher-order thinking and deep learning. However, large language models (LLMs) currently face challenges in generating pedagogically rich interactions. This study systematically investigates the structural and behavioral differences between AI-simulated and authentic human tutoring dialogues. We conducted a quantitative comparison using an Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA). The results show that human dialogues are significantly superior to their AI counterparts in utterance length, as well as in questioning (I-Q) and general feedback (F-F) behaviors. More importantly, ENA results reveal a fundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more cognitively guided and diverse, centered around a "question-factual response-feedback" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and student-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of structural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an "explanation-simplistic response" loop that is essentially a simple information transfer between the teacher and student. These findings illuminate key limitations in current AI-generated tutoring and provide empirical guidance for designing and evaluating more pedagogically effective generative educational dialogue systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Speculative Agent Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their remarkable success in complex tasks propelling widespread adoption, large language-model-based agents still face critical deployment challenges due to prohibitive latency and inference costs. While recent work has explored various methods to accelerate inference, existing approaches suffer from significant limitations: they either fail to preserve performance fidelity, require extensive offline training of router modules, or incur excessive operational costs. Moreover, they provide minimal user control over the tradeoff between acceleration and other performance metrics. To address these gaps, we introduce Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), an asynchronous online reinforcement learning framework that provides lossless acceleration with substantially reduced costs without requiring additional pre-deployment preparation. DSP explicitly optimizes a joint objective balancing end-to-end latency against dollar cost, allowing practitioners to adjust a single parameter that steers the system toward faster responses, cheaper operation, or any point along this continuum. Experiments on two standard agent benchmarks demonstrate that DSP achieves comparable efficiency to the fastest lossless acceleration method while reducing total cost by 30% and unnecessary cost up to 60%. Our code and data are available through https://github.com/guanyilin428/Dynamic-Speculative-Planning.</description>

      <title>EigenBench: A Comparative Behavioral Measure of Value Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning AI with human values is a pressing unsolved problem. To address the lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a black-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a weighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground truth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges may disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether EigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that most of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual quantifies the disposition of the model itself.</description>

      <title>mFARM: Towards Multi-Faceted Fairness Assessment based on HARMs in Clinical Decision Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes medical settings poses a critical AI alignment challenge, as models can inherit and amplify societal biases, leading to significant disparities. Existing fairness evaluation methods fall short in these contexts as they typically use simplistic metrics that overlook the multi-dimensional nature of medical harms. This also promotes models that are fair only because they are clinically inert, defaulting to safe but potentially inaccurate outputs. To address this gap, our contributions are mainly two-fold: first, we construct two large-scale, controlled benchmarks (ED-Triage and Opioid Analgesic Recommendation) from MIMIC-IV, comprising over 50,000 prompts with twelve race x gender variants and three context tiers. Second, we propose a multi-metric framework - Multi-faceted Fairness Assessment based on hARMs ($mFARM$) to audit fairness for three distinct dimensions of disparity (Allocational, Stability, and Latent) and aggregate them into an $mFARM$ score. We also present an aggregated Fairness-Accuracy Balance (FAB) score to benchmark and observe trade-offs between fairness and prediction accuracy. We empirically evaluate four open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B, Qwen-2.5-7B, Bio-LLaMA3-8B) and their finetuned versions under quantization and context variations. Our findings showcase that the proposed $mFARM$ metrics capture subtle biases more effectively under various settings. We find that most models maintain robust performance in terms of $mFARM$ score across varying levels of quantization but deteriorate significantly when the context is reduced. Our benchmarks and evaluation code are publicly released to enhance research in aligned AI for healthcare.</description>

Abstract: Many scientists use generative AI in their scientific work. People working in technology assessment (TA) are no exception. TA's approach to generative AI is twofold: on the one hand, generative AI is used for TA work, and on the other hand, generative AI is the subject of TA research. After briefly outlining the phenomenon of generative AI and formulating requirements for its use in TA, the following article discusses in detail the structural causes of the problems associated with it. Although generative AI is constantly being further developed, the structurally induced risks remain. The article concludes with proposed solutions and brief notes on their feasibility, as well as some examples of the use of generative AI in TA work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is often measured by the range of tasks it can perform. Yet wide ability without depth remains only an imitation. This paper proposes a Structural-Generative Ontology of Intelligence: true intelligence exists only when a system can generate new structures, coordinate them into reasons, and sustain its identity over time. These three conditions -- generativity, coordination, and sustaining -- define the depth that underlies real intelligence. Current AI systems, however broad in function, remain surface simulations because they lack this depth. Breadth is not the source of intelligence but the growth that follows from depth. If future systems were to meet these conditions, they would no longer be mere tools, but could be seen as a possible Second Being, standing alongside yet distinct from human existence.</description>

      <title>LLMs for LLMs: A Structured Prompting Methodology for Long Legal Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has had a profoundly transformative effect on a number of fields and domains. However, their uptake in Law has proven more challenging due to the important issues of reliability and transparency. In this study, we present a structured prompting methodology as a viable alternative to the often expensive fine-tuning, with the capability of tacking long legal documents from the CUAD dataset on the task of information retrieval. Each document is first split into chunks via a system of chunking and augmentation, addressing the long document problem. Then, alongside an engineered prompt, the input is fed into QWEN-2 to produce a set of answers for each question. Finally, we tackle the resulting candidate selection problem with the introduction of the Distribution-based Localisation and Inverse Cardinality Weighting heuristics. This approach leverages a general purpose model to promote long term scalability, prompt engineering to increase reliability and the two heuristic strategies to reduce the impact of the black box effect. Whilst our model performs up to 9\% better than the previously presented method, reaching state-of-the-art performance, it also highlights the limiting factor of current automatic evaluation metrics for question answering, serving as a call to action for future research. However, the chief aim of this work is to underscore the potential of structured prompt engineering as a useful, yet under-explored, tool in ensuring accountability and responsibility of AI in the legal domain, and beyond.</description>

      <title>An Epidemiological Knowledge Graph extracted from the World Health Organization's Disease Outbreak News</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), together with the increased availability of social media and news for epidemiological surveillance, are marking a pivotal moment in epidemiology and public health research. Leveraging the power of generative AI, we use an ensemble approach which incorporates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract valuable actionable epidemiological information from the World Health Organization (WHO) Disease Outbreak News (DONs). DONs is a collection of regular reports on global outbreaks curated by the WHO and the adopted decision-making processes to respond to them. The extracted information is made available in a daily-updated dataset and a knowledge graph, referred to as eKG, derived to provide a nuanced representation of the public health domain knowledge. We provide an overview of this new dataset and describe the structure of eKG, along with the services and tools used to access and utilize the data that we are building on top. These innovative data resources open altogether new opportunities for epidemiological research, and the analysis and surveillance of disease outbreaks.</description>

      <title>Rewarding Explainability in Drug Repurposing with Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for modelling complex, multi-relational data and supporting hypothesis generation, particularly in applications like drug repurposing. However, for predictive methods to gain acceptance as credible scientific tools, they must ensure not only accuracy but also the capacity to offer meaningful scientific explanations. This paper presents a novel approach REx, for generating scientific explanations based in link prediction in knowledge graphs. It employs reward and policy mechanisms that consider desirable properties of scientific explanation to guide a reinforcement learning agent in the identification of explanatory paths within a KG. The approach further enriches explanatory paths with domain-specific ontologies, ensuring that the explanations are both insightful and grounded in established biomedical knowledge. We evaluate our approach in drug repurposing using three popular knowledge graph benchmarks. The results clearly demonstrate its ability to generate explanations that validate predictive insights against biomedical knowledge and that outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in predictive performance, establishing REx as a relevant contribution to advance AI-driven scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Re-evaluating LLM-based Heuristic Search: A Case Study on the 3D Packing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The art of heuristic design has traditionally been a human pursuit. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their application has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within human-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open question. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver for the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved fragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint scaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative self-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a viable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy process, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the scoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior work may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of LLM capabilities. The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed greedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a human-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers, though its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened. Our findings highlight two major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the engineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks, and the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search for novel solutions.</description>

      <title>Exploring Diffusion Models for Generative Forecasting of Financial Charts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have enabled significant progress in tasks such as generating and editing images from text, as well as creating videos from text prompts, and these methods are being applied across various fields. However, in the financial domain, there may still be a reliance on time-series data and a continued focus on transformer models, rather than on diverse applications of generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages text-to-image model by treating time-series data as a single image pattern, thereby enabling the prediction of stock price trends. Unlike prior methods that focus on learning and classifying chart patterns using architectures such as ResNet or ViT, we experiment with generating the next chart image from the current chart image and an instruction prompt using diffusion models. Furthermore, we introduce a simple method for evaluating the generated chart image against ground truth image. We highlight the potential of leveraging text-to-image generative models in the financial domain, and our findings motivate further research to address the current limitations and expand their applicability.</description>

      <title>Explainability-Driven Dimensionality Reduction for Hyperspectral Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for precise material classification and analysis; however, its high dimensionality introduces a computational burden and redundancy, making dimensionality reduction essential. We present an exploratory study into the application of post-hoc explainability methods in a model--driven framework for band selection, which reduces the spectral dimension while preserving predictive performance. A trained classifier is probed with explanations to quantify each band's contribution to its decisions. We then perform deletion--insertion evaluations, recording confidence changes as ranked bands are removed or reintroduced, and aggregate these signals into influence scores. Selecting the highest--influence bands yields compact spectral subsets that maintain accuracy and improve efficiency. Experiments on two public benchmarks (Pavia University and Salinas) demonstrate that classifiers trained on as few as 30 selected bands match or exceed full--spectrum baselines while reducing computational requirements. The resulting subsets align with physically meaningful, highly discriminative wavelength regions, indicating that model--aligned, explanation-guided band selection is a principled route to effective dimensionality reduction for HSI.</description>

      <title>When Agents go Astray: Course-Correcting SWE Agents with PRMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed for complex, multi-step software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, their trajectories often contain costly inefficiencies, such as redundant exploration, looping, and failure to terminate once a solution is reached. Prior work has largely treated these errors in a post-hoc manner, diagnosing failures only after execution. In this paper, we introduce SWE-PRM, an inference-time Process Reward Model (PRM) that intervenes during execution to detect and course-correct trajectory-level errors. Our PRM design leverages a taxonomy of common inefficiencies and delivers lightweight, interpretable feedback without modifying the underlying policy. On SWE-bench Verified, closed-source PRMs improve resolution from 40.0% to 50.6% (+10.6 p.p.), with the largest gains on medium and hard tasks. Among feedback strategies, taxonomy-guided PRMs outperform unguided or explicit action-prescriptive variants, increasing success rate while reducing trajectory length. These benefits come at an acceptable added inference cost of as low as $0.2, making PRMs a practical and scalable mechanism for improving SWE agents' reliability and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Towards Agents That Know When They Don't Know: Uncertainty as a Control Signal for Structured Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in structured biomedical data environments, yet they often produce fluent but overconfident outputs when reasoning over complex multi-table data. We introduce an uncertainty-aware agent for query-conditioned multi-table summarization that leverages two complementary signals: (i) retrieval uncertainty--entropy over multiple table-selection rollouts--and (ii) summary uncertainty--combining self-consistency and perplexity. Summary uncertainty is incorporated into reinforcement learning (RL) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), while both retrieval and summary uncertainty guide inference-time filtering and support the construction of higher-quality synthetic datasets.
  On multi-omics benchmarks, our approach improves factuality and calibration, nearly tripling correct and useful claims per summary (3.0\(\rightarrow\)8.4 internal; 3.6\(\rightarrow\)9.9 cancer multi-omics) and substantially improving downstream survival prediction (C-index 0.32\(\rightarrow\)0.63). These results demonstrate that uncertainty can serve as a control signal--enabling agents to abstain, communicate confidence, and become more reliable tools for complex structured-data environments.</description>

      <title>AppCopilot: Toward General, Accurate, Long-Horizon, and Efficient Mobile Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal foundation models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that must be solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1) generalization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy, specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3) long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency, specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device assistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack, closed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this position through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection, training, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile application development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution layer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice interaction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and comprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates profiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant improvements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization, higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion, and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.</description>

      <title>GridMind: LLMs-Powered Agents for Power System Analysis and Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of traditional power system analysis workflows presents significant barriers to efficient decision-making in modern electric grids. This paper presents GridMind, a multi-agent AI system that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with deterministic engineering solvers to enable conversational scientific computing for power system analysis. The system employs specialized agents coordinating AC Optimal Power Flow and N-1 contingency analysis through natural language interfaces while maintaining numerical precision via function calls. GridMind addresses workflow integration, knowledge accessibility, context preservation, and expert decision-support augmentation. Experimental evaluation on IEEE test cases demonstrates that the proposed agentic framework consistently delivers correct solutions across all tested language models, with smaller LLMs achieving comparable analytical accuracy with reduced computational latency. This work establishes agentic AI as a viable paradigm for scientific computing, demonstrating how conversational interfaces can enhance accessibility while preserving numerical rigor essential for critical engineering applications.</description>

      <title>UI-TARS-2 Technical Report: Advancing GUI Agent with Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning, action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5. On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g., OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks, highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization to real-world interactive scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Landscape of Agentic Reinforcement Learning for LLMs: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous, decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL. Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable, general-purpose AI agents.</description>

      <title>IPG: Incremental Patch Generation for Generalized Adversarial Patch Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation (IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore, IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes environments.</description>

      <title>Per-sender neural network classifiers for email authorship validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Business email compromise and lateral spear phishing attacks are among modern organizations' most costly and damaging threats. While inbound phishing defenses have improved significantly, most organizations still trust internal emails by default, leaving themselves vulnerable to attacks from compromised employee accounts. In this work, we define and explore the problem of authorship validation: verifying whether a claimed sender actually authored a given email. Authorship validation is a lightweight, real-time defense that complements traditional detection methods by modeling per-sender writing style. Further, the paper presents a collection of new datasets based on the Enron corpus. These simulate inauthentic messages using both human-written and large language model-generated emails. The paper also evaluates two classifiers -- a Naive Bayes model and a character-level convolutional neural network (Char-CNN) -- for the authorship validation task. Our experiments show that the Char-CNN model achieves high accuracy and F1 scores under various circumstances. Finally, we discuss deployment considerations and show that per-sender authorship classifiers are practical for integrating into existing commercial email security systems with low overhead.</description>

      <title>Optimized Renewable Energy Planning MDP for Socially-Equitable Electricity Coverage in the US</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional power grid infrastructure presents significant barriers to renewable energy integration and perpetuates energy access inequities, with low-income communities experiencing disproportionately longer power outages. This study develops a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to optimize renewable energy allocation while explicitly addressing social equity concerns in electricity distribution. The model incorporates budget constraints, energy demand variability, and social vulnerability indicators across eight major U.S. cities to evaluate policy alternatives for equitable clean energy transitions. Numerical experiments compare the MDP-based approach against baseline policies including random allocation, greedy renewable expansion, and expert heuristics. Results demonstrate that equity-focused optimization can achieve 32.9% renewable energy penetration while reducing underserved low-income populations by 55% compared to conventional approaches. The expert policy achieved the highest reward, while the Monte Carlo Tree Search baseline provided competitive performance with significantly lower budget utilization, demonstrating that fair distribution of clean energy resources is achievable without sacrificing overall system performance and providing ways for integrating social equity considerations with climate goals and inclusive access to clean power infrastructure.</description>

      <title>A Fluid Antenna Enabled Physical Layer Key Generation for Next-G Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a promising physical layer security technique, physical layer key generation (PLKG) enables legitimate users to obtain secret keys from wireless channel without security infrastructures. However, in harsh propagation environments, the channel characteristic becomes unsatisfactory, the key generation rate (KGR) is significantly deteriorated. In this paper, we propose a novel fluid antenna (FA) enabled PLKG system to address this challenge. Specifically, we first derive the closed-form expression of the KGR for FA array, and then jointly optimize the precoding matrix and the antenna positions via a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Next, to further reduce the computational complexity of the optimization procedure, we develop an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, which combines the projected gradient descent (PGD) and the PSO. Simulation results demonstrate that by exploiting the additional spatial degree of freedom (DoF), our FA enabled PLKG system is superior to the benchmarks, such as the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) array and the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). It is worth highlighting that compared to the conventional uniform planar antenna (UPA), the FA enabled PLKG achieves a 35.42\% KGR performance improvement under PSO algorithm and a 67.73\% KGR performance improvement under AO algorithm, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) has been a challenging problem in spoken language processing research, because it is unclear how human emotions are connected to various components of sounds such as pitch, loudness, and energy. This paper aims to tackle this problem using machine learning. Particularly, we built several machine learning models using SVMs, LTSMs, and CNNs to classify emotions in human speeches. In addition, by leveraging transfer learning and data augmentation, we efficiently trained our models to attain decent performances on a relatively small dataset. Our best model was a ResNet34 network, which achieved an accuracy of $66.7\%$ and an F1 score of $0.631$.</description>

      <title>From Sound to Sight: Towards AI-authored Music Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional music visualisation systems rely on handcrafted ad hoc transformations of shapes and colours that offer only limited expressiveness. We propose two novel pipelines for automatically generating music videos from any user-specified, vocal or instrumental song using off-the-shelf deep learning models. Inspired by the manual workflows of music video producers, we experiment on how well latent feature-based techniques can analyse audio to detect musical qualities, such as emotional cues and instrumental patterns, and distil them into textual scene descriptions using a language model. Next, we employ a generative model to produce the corresponding video clips. To assess the generated videos, we identify several critical aspects and design and conduct a preliminary user evaluation that demonstrates storytelling potential, visual coherency and emotional alignment with the music. Our findings underscore the potential of latent feature techniques and deep generative models to expand music visualisation beyond traditional approaches.</description>

      <title>ZeroQAT: Your Quantization-aware Training but Efficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantization is an effective technique to reduce the deployment cost of large language models (LLMs), and post-training quantization (PTQ) has been widely studied due to its efficiency. However, existing low-bit PTQ methods suffer from accuracy degradation because their layer-wise optimization introduces cumulative error propagation and misalignment between local reconstruction objectives and downstream performance. While quantization-aware training (QAT) provides a principled solution, its reliance on backpropagation incurs prohibitive data, time, and memory costs, limiting its practicality. To address these challenges, we propose ZeroQAT, a zeroth-order optimization-based QAT framework. ZeroQAT leverages forward-only gradient estimation to eliminate the need for backpropagation, significantly reducing computational and memory overhead while retaining the benefits of end-to-end optimization. Moreover, ZeroQAT jointly learns quantized weights, weight clipping thresholds, and equivalent transformations to mitigate quantization error and handle activation outliers. Experiments demonstrate that ZeroQAT achieves the efficiency of PTQ while retaining the accuracy of QAT, offering a practical solution for high-quality low-bit quantization of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Minimum Operating Voltage Prediction in Advanced Technology Nodes: Leveraging Legacy Data and Silicon Odometer Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of chip performance is critical for ensuring energy efficiency and reliability in semiconductor manufacturing. However, developing minimum operating voltage ($V_{min}$) prediction models at advanced technology nodes is challenging due to limited training data and the complex relationship between process variations and $V_{min}$. To address these issues, we propose a novel transfer learning framework that leverages abundant legacy data from the 16nm technology node to enable accurate $V_{min}$ prediction at the advanced 5nm node. A key innovation of our approach is the integration of input features derived from on-chip silicon odometer sensor data, which provide fine-grained characterization of localized process variations -- an essential factor at the 5nm node -- resulting in significantly improved prediction accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential to accelerate systematic literature reviews (SLRs), yet current approaches often rely on brittle, manually crafted prompts that compromise reliability and reproducibility. This fragility undermines scientific confidence in LLM-assisted evidence synthesis. In response, this work adapts recent advances in declarative prompt optimisation, developed for general-purpose LLM applications, and demonstrates their applicability to the domain of SLR automation. This research proposes a structured, domain-specific framework that embeds task declarations, test suites, and automated prompt tuning into a reproducible SLR workflow. These emerging methods are translated into a concrete blueprint with working code examples, enabling researchers to construct verifiable LLM pipelines that align with established principles of transparency and rigour in evidence synthesis. This is a novel application of such approaches to SLR pipelines.</description>

Abstract: We present ARTPS (Autonomous Rover Target Prioritization System), a novel hybrid AI system that combines depth estimation, anomaly detection, and learnable curiosity scoring for autonomous exploration of planetary surfaces. Our approach integrates monocular depth estimation using Vision Transformers with multi-component anomaly detection and a weighted curiosity score that balances known value, anomaly signals, depth variance, and surface roughness. The system achieves state-of-the-art performance with AUROC of 0.94, AUPRC of 0.89, and F1-Score of 0.87 on Mars rover datasets. We demonstrate significant improvements in target prioritization accuracy through ablation studies and provide comprehensive analysis of component contributions. The hybrid fusion approach reduces false positives by 23% while maintaining high detection sensitivity across diverse terrain types.</description>

      <title>Exploring and Reshaping the Weight Distribution in LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models is influenced by their characteristics such as architecture, model sizes, decoding methods and so on. Due to differences in structure or function, the weights in different layers of large models have varying distributions. This paper explores the correlations between different types of layers in terms of weights distribution and studies the potential impact of these correlations on LoRA training effectiveness. Firstly, the study reveals that in the model the cosine distances between weights of different layers manifest power-law distribution. We extract Query-projection, down-projection and other weight matrices from the self-attention layers and MLP layers, calculate the singular values of the matrices using singular value decomposition, and organize a certain number of singular values into matrices according to projection's type. By analyzing the probability distribution of the cosine distances between these matrices, it is found that the cosine distances values between them have distinct power-law distribution characteristics. Secondly, based on the results of distance calculations and analysis across different layers of model, a qualitative method is proposed to describe the distribution characteristics of different models. Next, to construct weights that align with the distribution characteristics, a data generator is designed using a combination of Gaussian process and Pareto distribution functions. The generator is used to simulate the generation of data that aligns with specific distribution characteristics. Finally, based on the aforementioned distribution characteristics and data generation method, the weights in LoRA initialization are reshaped for training. Experimental results indicate that, without altering the model structure or training process, this method achieves a certain improvement in the performance of LoRA training.</description>

      <title>Teaching AI to Remember: Insights from Brain-Inspired Replay in Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) continue to face challenges in continual learning, particularly due to catastrophic forgetting, the loss of previously learned knowledge when acquiring new tasks. Inspired by memory consolidation in the human brain, we investigate the internal replay mechanism proposed by~\citep{brain_inspired_replay1}, which reactivates latent representations of prior experiences during learning. As internal replay was identified as the most influential component among the brain-inspired mechanisms in their framework, it serves as the central focus of our in-depth investigation. Using the CIFAR-100 dataset in a class-incremental setting, we evaluate the effectiveness of internal replay, both in isolation and in combination with Synaptic Intelligence (SI). Our experiments show that internal replay significantly mitigates forgetting, especially when paired with SI, but at the cost of reduced initial task accuracy, highlighting a trade-off between memory stability and learning plasticity. Further analyses using log-likelihood distributions, reconstruction errors, silhouette scores, and UMAP projections reveal that internal replay increases representational overlap in latent space, potentially limiting task-specific differentiation. These results underscore the limitations of current brain-inspired methods and suggest future directions for balancing retention and adaptability in continual learning systems.</description>

      <title>Applying Deep Learning to Anomaly Detection of Russian Satellite Activity for Indications Prior to Military Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply deep learning techniques for anomaly detection to analyze activity of Russian-owned resident space objects (RSO) prior to the Ukraine invasion and assess the results for any findings that can be used as indications and warnings (I&amp;W) of aggressive military behavior for future conflicts. Through analysis of anomalous activity, an understanding of possible tactics and procedures can be established to assess the existence of statistically significant changes in Russian RSO pattern of life/pattern of behavior (PoL/PoB) using publicly available two-line element (TLE) data. This research looks at statistical and deep learning approaches to assess anomalous activity. The deep learning methods assessed are isolation forest (IF), traditional autoencoder (AE), variational autoencoder (VAE), Kolmogorov Arnold Network (KAN), and a novel anchor-loss based autoencoder (Anchor AE). Each model is used to establish a baseline of on-orbit activity based on a five-year data sample. The primary investigation period focuses on the six months leading up to the invasion date of February 24, 2022. Additional analysis looks at RSO activity during an active combat period by sampling TLE data after the invasion date. The deep learning autoencoder models identify anomalies based on reconstruction errors that surpass a threshold sigma. To capture the nuance and unique characteristics of each RSO an individual model was trained for each observed space object. The research made an effort to prioritize explainability and interpretability of the model results thus each observation was assessed for anomalous behavior of the individual six orbital elements versus analyzing the input data as a single monolithic observation. The results demonstrate not only statistically significant anomalies of Russian RSO activity but also details anomalous findings to the individual orbital element.</description>

      <title>Lightning Fast Caching-based Parallel Denoising Prediction for Accelerating Talking Head Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based talking head models generate high-quality, photorealistic videos but suffer from slow inference, limiting practical applications. Existing acceleration methods for general diffusion models fail to exploit the temporal and spatial redundancies unique to talking head generation. In this paper, we propose a task-specific framework addressing these inefficiencies through two key innovations. First, we introduce Lightning-fast Caching-based Parallel denoising prediction (LightningCP), caching static features to bypass most model layers in inference time. We also enable parallel prediction using cached features and estimated noisy latents as inputs, efficiently bypassing sequential sampling. Second, we propose Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA) to further accelerate attention computations, exploiting the spatial decoupling in talking head videos to restrict attention to dynamic foreground regions. Additionally, we remove reference features in certain layers to bring extra speedup. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly improves inference speed while preserving video quality.</description>

      <title>Traj-MLLM: Can Multimodal Large Language Models Reform Trajectory Data Mining?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building a general model capable of analyzing human trajectories across different geographic regions and different tasks becomes an emergent yet important problem for various applications. However, existing works suffer from the generalization problem, \ie, they are either restricted to train for specific regions or only suitable for a few tasks. Given the recent advances of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we raise the question: can MLLMs reform current trajectory data mining and solve the problem? Nevertheless, due to the modality gap of trajectory, how to generate task-independent multimodal trajectory representations and how to adapt flexibly to different tasks remain the foundational challenges. In this paper, we propose \texttt{Traj-MLLM}}, which is the first general framework using MLLMs for trajectory data mining. By integrating multiview contexts, \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} transforms raw trajectories into interleaved image-text sequences while preserving key spatial-temporal characteristics, and directly utilizes the reasoning ability of MLLMs for trajectory analysis. Additionally, a prompt optimization method is proposed to finalize data-invariant prompts for task adaptation. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets show that \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by $48.05\%$, $15.52\%$, $51.52\%$, $1.83\%$ on travel time estimation, mobility prediction, anomaly detection and transportation mode identification, respectively. \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} achieves these superior performances without requiring any training data or fine-tuning the MLLM backbones.</description>

      <title>Robotic Fire Risk Detection based on Dynamic Knowledge Graph Reasoning: An LLM-Driven Approach with Graph Chain-of-Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fire is a highly destructive disaster, but effective prevention can significantly reduce its likelihood of occurrence. When it happens, deploying emergency robots in fire-risk scenarios can help minimize the danger to human responders. However, current research on pre-disaster warnings and disaster-time rescue still faces significant challenges due to incomplete perception, inadequate fire situational awareness, and delayed response. To enhance intelligent perception and response planning for robots in fire scenarios, we first construct a knowledge graph (KG) by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to integrate fire domain knowledge derived from fire prevention guidelines and fire rescue task information from robotic emergency response documents. We then propose a new framework called Insights-on-Graph (IOG), which integrates the structured fire information of KG and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). The framework generates perception-driven risk graphs from real-time scene imagery to enable early fire risk detection and provide interpretable emergency responses for task module and robot component configuration based on the evolving risk situation. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments show that IOG has good applicability and practical application value in fire risk detection and rescue decision-making.</description>

      <title>U2UData-2: A Scalable Swarm UAVs Autonomous Flight Dataset for Long-horizon Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Swarm UAV autonomous flight for Long-Horizon (LH) tasks is crucial for advancing the low-altitude economy. However, existing methods focus only on specific basic tasks due to dataset limitations, failing in real-world deployment for LH tasks. LH tasks are not mere concatenations of basic tasks, requiring handling long-term dependencies, maintaining persistent states, and adapting to dynamic goal shifts. This paper presents U2UData-2, the first large-scale swarm UAV autonomous flight dataset for LH tasks and the first scalable swarm UAV data online collection and algorithm closed-loop verification platform. The dataset is captured by 15 UAVs in autonomous collaborative flights for LH tasks, comprising 12 scenes, 720 traces, 120 hours, 600 seconds per trajectory, 4.32M LiDAR frames, and 12.96M RGB frames. This dataset also includes brightness, temperature, humidity, smoke, and airflow values covering all flight routes. The platform supports the customization of simulators, UAVs, sensors, flight algorithms, formation modes, and LH tasks. Through a visual control window, this platform allows users to collect customized datasets through one-click deployment online and to verify algorithms by closed-loop simulation. U2UData-2 also introduces an LH task for wildlife conservation and provides comprehensive benchmarks with 9 SOTA models. U2UData-2 can be found at https://fengtt42.github.io/U2UData-2/.</description>

      <title>From Data to Decision: A Multi-Stage Framework for Class Imbalance Mitigation in Optical Network Failure Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning-based failure management in optical networks has gained significant attention in recent years. However, severe class imbalance, where normal instances vastly outnumber failure cases, remains a considerable challenge. While pre- and in-processing techniques have been widely studied, post-processing methods are largely unexplored. In this work, we present a direct comparison of pre-, in-, and post-processing approaches for class imbalance mitigation in failure detection and identification using an experimental dataset. For failure detection, post-processing methods-particularly Threshold Adjustment-achieve the highest F1 score improvement (up to 15.3%), while Random Under-Sampling provides the fastest inference. In failure identification, GenAI methods deliver the most substantial performance gains (up to 24.2%), whereas post-processing shows limited impact in multi-class settings. When class overlap is present and latency is critical, over-sampling methods such as the SMOTE are most effective; without latency constraints, Meta-Learning yields the best results. In low-overlap scenarios, Generative AI approaches provide the highest performance with minimal inference time.</description>

      <title>Scaffold Diffusion: Sparse Multi-Category Voxel Structure Generation with Discrete Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that, unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over 98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize generated samples and the generation process. Our results highlight discrete diffusion as a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling.</description>

      <title>MolErr2Fix:Benchmarking LLM Trustworthiness in Chemistry via Modular Error Detection, Localization, Explanation, and Revision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown growing potential in molecular sciences, but they often produce chemically inaccurate descriptions and struggle to recognize or justify potential errors. This raises important concerns about their robustness and reliability in scientific applications. To support more rigorous evaluation of LLMs in chemical reasoning, we present the MolErr2Fix benchmark, designed to assess LLMs on error detection and correction in molecular descriptions. Unlike existing benchmarks focused on molecule-to-text generation or property prediction, MolErr2Fix emphasizes fine-grained chemical understanding. It tasks LLMs with identifying, localizing, explaining, and revising potential structural and semantic errors in molecular descriptions. Specifically, MolErr2Fix consists of 1,193 fine-grained annotated error instances. Each instance contains quadruple annotations, i.e,. (error type, span location, the explanation, and the correction). These tasks are intended to reflect the types of reasoning and verification required in real-world chemical communication. Evaluations of current state-of-the-art LLMs reveal notable performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust chemical reasoning capabilities. MolErr2Fix provides a focused benchmark for evaluating such capabilities and aims to support progress toward more reliable and chemically informed language models. All annotations and an accompanying evaluation API will be publicly released to facilitate future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objectives: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare promises to revolutionize patient care, diagnostics, and treatment protocols. Collaborative efforts among healthcare systems, research institutions, and industry are pivotal to leveraging AI's full potential. This study aims to characterize collaborative networks and stakeholders in AI healthcare initiatives, identify challenges and opportunities within these collaborations, and elucidate priorities for future AI research and development. Methods: This study utilized data from the Chinese Society of Radiology and the Chinese Medical Imaging AI Innovation Alliance. A national cross-sectional survey was conducted in China (N = 5,142) across 31 provincial administrative regions, involving participants from three key groups: clinicians, institution professionals, and industry representatives. The survey explored diverse aspects including current AI usage in healthcare, collaboration dynamics, challenges encountered, and research and development priorities. Results: Findings reveal high interest in AI among clinicians, with a significant gap between interest and actual engagement in development activities. Despite the willingness to share data, progress is hindered by concerns about data privacy and security, and lack of clear industry standards and legal guidelines. Future development interests focus on lesion screening, disease diagnosis, and enhancing clinical workflows. Conclusion: This study highlights an enthusiastic yet cautious approach toward AI in healthcare, characterized by significant barriers that impede effective collaboration and implementation. Recommendations emphasize the need for AI-specific education and training, secure data-sharing frameworks, establishment of clear industry standards, and formation of dedicated AI research departments.</description>

      <title>SynCircuit: Automated Generation of New Synthetic RTL Circuits Can Enable Big Data in Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, AI-assisted IC design methods have demonstrated great potential, but the availability of circuit design data is extremely limited, especially in the public domain. The lack of circuit data has become the primary bottleneck in developing AI-assisted IC design methods. In this work, we make the first attempt, SynCircuit, to generate new synthetic circuits with valid functionalities in the HDL format. SynCircuit automatically generates synthetic data using a framework with three innovative steps: 1) We propose a customized diffusion-based generative model to resolve the Directed Cyclic Graph (DCG) generation task, which has not been well explored in the AI community. 2) To ensure our circuit is valid, we enforce the circuit constraints by refining the initial graph generation outputs. 3) The Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) method further optimizes the logic redundancy in the generated graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SynCircuit can generate more realistic synthetic circuits and enhance ML model performance in downstream circuit design tasks.</description>

      <title>Amplifying Emotional Signals: Data-Efficient Deep Learning for Robust Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) presents a significant yet persistent challenge in human-computer interaction. While deep learning has advanced spoken language processing, achieving high performance on limited datasets remains a critical hurdle. This paper confronts this issue by developing and evaluating a suite of machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for automated emotion classification in human speech. We demonstrate that by strategically employing transfer learning and innovative data augmentation techniques, our models can achieve impressive performance despite the constraints of a relatively small dataset. Our most effective model, a ResNet34 architecture, establishes a new performance benchmark on the combined RAVDESS and SAVEE datasets, attaining an accuracy of 66.7% and an F1 score of 0.631. These results underscore the substantial benefits of leveraging pre-trained models and data augmentation to overcome data scarcity, thereby paving the way for more robust and generalizable SER systems.</description>

      <title>Enabling Transparent Cyber Threat Intelligence Combining Large Language Models and Domain Ontologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) relies upon accurately structured and semantically enriched information extracted from cybersecurity system logs. However, current methodologies often struggle to identify and interpret malicious events reliably and transparently, particularly in cases involving unstructured or ambiguous log entries. In this work, we propose a novel methodology that combines ontology-driven structured outputs with Large Language Models (LLMs), to build an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent that improves the accuracy and explainability of information extraction from cybersecurity logs. Central to our approach is the integration of domain ontologies and SHACL-based constraints to guide the language model's output structure and enforce semantic validity over the resulting graph. Extracted information is organized into an ontology-enriched graph database, enabling future semantic analysis and querying. The design of our methodology is motivated by the analytical requirements associated with honeypot log data, which typically comprises predominantly malicious activity. While our case study illustrates the relevance of this scenario, the experimental evaluation is conducted using publicly available datasets. Results demonstrate that our method achieves higher accuracy in information extraction compared to traditional prompt-only approaches, with a deliberate focus on extraction quality rather than processing speed.</description>

      <title>Data Cartography for Detecting Memorization Hotspots and Guiding Data Interventions in Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern generative models risk overfitting and unintentionally memorizing rare training examples, which can be extracted by adversaries or inflate benchmark performance. We propose Generative Data Cartography (GenDataCarto), a data-centric framework that assigns each pretraining sample a difficulty score (early-epoch loss) and a memorization score (frequency of ``forget events''), then partitions examples into four quadrants to guide targeted pruning and up-/down-weighting. We prove that our memorization score lower-bounds classical influence under smoothness assumptions and that down-weighting high-memorization hotspots provably decreases the generalization gap via uniform stability bounds. Empirically, GenDataCarto reduces synthetic canary extraction success by over 40\% at just 10\% data pruning, while increasing validation perplexity by less than 0.5\%. These results demonstrate that principled data interventions can dramatically mitigate leakage with minimal cost to generative performance.</description>

      <title>Learning to Refine: Self-Refinement of Parallel Reasoning in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To further enhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex, multi-step reasoning problems, test-time scaling (TTS) methods have gained widespread attention. Existing approaches such as Best-of-N and majority voting are limited as their performance depends on the quality of candidate responses, making them unable to produce a correct solution when all candidates are incorrect. Introducing an additional model to select the best response also incurs significant deployment costs. To this end, we introduce Generative Self-Refinement (GSR), a novel parallel test-time scaling framework where a unified model first generates a set of candidate responses in parallel and then performs self-refinement to synthesize a new superior solution based on a prompt consisting of the problem and these candidates. However, LLMs struggle to perform refinement effectively when prompted directly. Therefore, we design a hybrid training pipeline by jointly optimizing for two complementary objectives, solving problems directly and refining candidate responses. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across five mathematical benchmarks. We further show that this learned self-refinement skill is a model-agnostic enhancement, robust across different model scales and generalizing to out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing societal reliance on artificial intelligence necessitates robust frameworks for ensuring its security, accountability, and trustworthiness. This thesis addresses the complex interplay between privacy, verifiability, and auditability in modern AI, particularly in foundation models. It argues that technical solutions that integrate these elements are critical for responsible AI innovation. Drawing from international policy contributions and technical research to identify key risks in the AI pipeline, this work introduces novel technical solutions for critical privacy and verifiability challenges. Specifically, the research introduces techniques for enabling verifiable and auditable claims about AI systems using zero-knowledge cryptography; utilizing secure multi-party computation and trusted execution environments for auditable, confidential deployment of large language models and information retrieval; and implementing enhanced delegation mechanisms, credentialing systems, and access controls to secure interactions with autonomous and multi-agent AI systems. Synthesizing these technical advancements, this dissertation presents a cohesive perspective on balancing privacy, verifiability, and auditability in foundation model-based AI systems, offering practical blueprints for system designers and informing policy discussions on AI safety and governance.</description>

      <title>Yet Unnoticed in LSTM: Binary Tree Based Input Reordering, Weight Regularization, and Gate Nonlinearization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LSTM models used in current Machine Learning literature and applications, has a promising solution for permitting long term information using gating mechanisms that forget and reduce effect of current input information. However, even with this pipeline, they do not optimally focus on specific old index or long-term information. This paper elaborates upon input reordering approaches to prioritize certain input indices. Moreover, no LSTM based approach is found in the literature that examines weight normalization while choosing the right weight and exponent of Lp norms through main supervised loss function. In this paper, we find out which norm best finds relationship between weights to either smooth or sparsify them. Lastly, gates, as weighted representations of inputs and states, which control reduction-extent of current input versus previous inputs (~ state), are not nonlinearized enough (through a small FFNN). As analogous to attention mechanisms, gates easily filter current information to bold (emphasize on) past inputs. Nonlinearized gates can more easily tune up to peculiar nonlinearities of specific input in the past. This type of nonlinearization is not proposed in the literature, to the best of author's knowledge. The proposed approaches are implemented and compared with a simple LSTM to understand their performance in text classification tasks. The results show they improve accuracy of LSTM.</description>

      <title>AEGIS : Automated Co-Evolutionary Framework for Guarding Prompt Injections Schema</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a significant challenge to the safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications. While prompt-based detection offers a lightweight and interpretable defense strategy, its effectiveness has been hindered by the need for manual prompt engineering. To address this issue, we propose AEGIS , an Automated co-Evolutionary framework for Guarding prompt Injections Schema. Both attack and defense prompts are iteratively optimized against each other using a gradient-like natural language prompt optimization technique. This framework enables both attackers and defenders to autonomously evolve via a Textual Gradient Optimization (TGO) module, leveraging feedback from an LLM-guided evaluation loop. We evaluate our system on a real-world assignment grading dataset of prompt injection attacks and demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior robustness in both attack success and detection. Specifically, the attack success rate (ASR) reaches 1.0, representing an improvement of 0.26 over the baseline. For detection, the true positive rate (TPR) improves by 0.23 compared to the previous best work, reaching 0.84, and the true negative rate (TNR) remains comparable at 0.89. Ablation studies confirm the importance of co-evolution, gradient buffering, and multi-objective optimization. We also confirm that this framework is effective in different LLMs. Our results highlight the promise of adversarial training as a scalable and effective approach for guarding prompt injections.</description>

      <title>Automatic Pronunciation Error Detection and Correction of the Holy Quran's Learners Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing spoken language is challenging, and quantifying pronunciation metrics for machine learning models is even harder. However, for the Holy Quran, this task is simplified by the rigorous recitation rules (tajweed) established by Muslim scholars, enabling highly effective assessment. Despite this advantage, the scarcity of high-quality annotated data remains a significant barrier.
  In this work, we bridge these gaps by introducing: (1) A 98% automated pipeline to produce high-quality Quranic datasets -- encompassing: Collection of recitations from expert reciters, Segmentation at pause points (waqf) using our fine-tuned wav2vec2-BERT model, Transcription of segments, Transcript verification via our novel Tasmeea algorithm; (2) 850+ hours of audio (~300K annotated utterances); (3) A novel ASR-based approach for pronunciation error detection, utilizing our custom Quran Phonetic Script (QPS) to encode Tajweed rules (unlike the IPA standard for Modern Standard Arabic). QPS uses a two-level script: (Phoneme level): Encodes Arabic letters with short/long vowels. (Sifa level): Encodes articulation characteristics of every phoneme. We further include comprehensive modeling with our novel multi-level CTC Model which achieved 0.16% average Phoneme Error Rate (PER) on the testset. We release all code, data, and models as open-source: https://obadx.github.io/prepare-quran-dataset/</description>

      <title>Exploiting a Mixture-of-Layers in an Electrocardiography Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based foundation models for Electrocardiograms (ECGs) have recently achieved impressive performance in many downstream applications. However, the internal representations of such models across layers have not been fully understood and exploited. An important question arises: Does the final layer of the pre-trained Transformer model, the \emph{de facto} representational layer, provide optimal performance for downstream tasks? Although our answer based on empirical and theoretical analyses for this question is negative, we propose a novel approach to leverage the representation diversity of the model's layers effectively. Specifically, we introduce a novel architecture called Post-pretraining Mixture-of-layers Aggregation (PMA), which enables a flexible combination of the layer-wise representations from the layer stack of a Transformer-based foundation model. We first pre-train the model from ECG signals using the 1-dimensional Vision Transformer (ViT) via masked modeling. In downstream applications, instead of relying solely on the last layer of the model, we employ a gating network to selectively fuse the representations from the pretrained model's layers, thereby enhancing representation power and improving performance of the downstream applications. In addition, we extend the proposed method to the pretraining stage by aggregating all representations through group-wise averaging before feeding them into the decoder-based Transformer.</description>

      <title>Pre-trained knowledge elevates large language models beyond traditional chemical reaction optimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern optimization in experimental chemistry employs algorithmic search through black-box parameter spaces. Here we demonstrate that pre-trained knowledge in large language models (LLMs) fundamentally changes this paradigm. Using six fully enumerated categorical reaction datasets (768 - 5,684 experiments), we benchmark LLM-guided optimization (LLM-GO) against Bayesian optimization (BO) and random sampling. Frontier LLMs consistently match or exceed BO performance across five single-objective datasets, with advantages growing as parameter complexity increases and high-performing conditions become scarce (&lt;5% of space). BO retains superiority only for explicit multi-objective trade-offs. To understand these contrasting behaviors, we introduce a topology-agnostic information theory framework quantifying sampling diversity throughout optimization campaigns. This analysis reveals that LLMs maintain systematically higher exploration entropy than BO across all datasets while achieving superior performance, with advantages most pronounced in solution-scarce parameter spaces where high-entropy exploration typically fails - suggesting that pre-trained domain knowledge enables more effective navigation of chemical parameter space rather than replacing structured exploration strategies. To enable transparent benchmarking and community validation, we release Iron Mind (https://gomes.andrew.cmu.edu/iron-mind), a no-code platform for side-by-side evaluation of human, algorithmic, and LLM optimization campaigns with public leaderboards and complete trajectories. Our findings establish that LLM-GO excels precisely where traditional methods struggle: complex categorical spaces requiring domain understanding rather than mathematical optimization.</description>

      <title>The Application of Virtual Environments and Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education: Experimental Findings in Philosophy Teaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores how virtual environments and artificial intelligence can enhance university students' learning experiences, with particular attention to the digital preferences of Generation Z. An experiment was conducted at the Faculty of Pedagogy, Humanities, and Social Sciences at University of Gyor, where Walter's Cube technology and a trained AI mediator were integrated into the instruction of ten philosophical topics. The curriculum was aligned with the official syllabus and enriched with visual content, quotations, and explanatory texts related to iconic figures in philosophy. A total of 77 first-year undergraduate students from full-time humanities and social sciences programs participated in the study. Following their end-of-semester offline written examination, students voluntarily completed a paper-based, anonymous ten-question test and provided feedback on the method's effectiveness. No sensitive personal data were collected, and the research was conducted with formal approval from the Faculty Dean. Descriptive statistics and inferential tests were applied to evaluate the impact of the virtual environment and AI mediation on learning outcomes. Results indicate that 80 percent of participants achieved good or excellent final exam grades, and the majority rated the virtual material as highly effective. Qualitative feedback emphasized increased motivation and deeper engagement, attributed to the immersive 3D presentation and interactive AI support. This research contributes to the advancement of digital pedagogy and suggests new directions for applying virtual and AI-based methods in higher education, particularly in disciplines where abstract reasoning and conceptual understanding are central.</description>

      <title>Meta-learning ecological priors from large language models explains human learning and decision making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human cognition is profoundly shaped by the environments in which it unfolds. Yet, it remains an open question whether learning and decision making can be explained as a principled adaptation to the statistical structure of real-world tasks. We introduce ecologically rational analysis, a computational framework that unifies the normative foundations of rational analysis with ecological grounding. Leveraging large language models to generate ecologically valid cognitive tasks at scale, and using meta-learning to derive rational models optimized for these environments, we develop a new class of learning algorithms: Ecologically Rational Meta-learned Inference (ERMI). ERMI internalizes the statistical regularities of naturalistic problem spaces and adapts flexibly to novel situations, without requiring hand-crafted heuristics or explicit parameter updates. We show that ERMI captures human behavior across 15 experiments spanning function learning, category learning, and decision making, outperforming several established cognitive models in trial-by-trial prediction. Our results suggest that much of human cognition may reflect adaptive alignment to the ecological structure of the problems we encounter in everyday life.</description>

      <title>Embodied AI: Emerging Risks and Opportunities for Policy Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of embodied AI (EAI) is rapidly advancing. Unlike virtual AI, EAI can exist in, learn from, reason about, and act in the physical world. Given recent innovations in large language and multimodal models, along with increasingly advanced and responsive hardware, EAI systems are rapidly growing in capabilities and operational domains. These advances present significant risks, including physical harm from malicious use, mass surveillance, and economic and societal disruption. However, these risks have been severely overlooked by policymakers. Existing policies, such as international standards for industrial robots or statutes governing autonomous vehicles, are insufficient to address the full range of concerns. While lawmakers are increasingly focused on AI, there is now an urgent need to extend and adapt existing frameworks to account for the unique risks of EAI. To help bridge this gap, this paper makes three contributions: first, we provide a foundational taxonomy of key physical, informational, economic, and social EAI risks. Secondly, we analyze policies in the US, EU, and UK to identify how existing frameworks address these risks and where these policies leave critical gaps. We conclude by offering concrete policy recommendations to address the coming wave of EAI innovation, including mandatory testing and certification for EAI systems, clarified liability frameworks, and forward-looking strategies to manage and prepare for transformative economic and societal impacts.</description>

      <title>A Whole New World: Creating a Parallel-Poisoned Web Only AI-Agents Can See</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel attack vector that leverages website cloaking techniques to compromise autonomous web-browsing agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). As these agents become more prevalent, their unique and often homogenous digital fingerprints - comprising browser attributes, automation framework signatures, and network characteristics - create a new, distinguishable class of web traffic. The attack exploits this fingerprintability. A malicious website can identify an incoming request as originating from an AI agent and dynamically serve a different, "cloaked" version of its content. While human users see a benign webpage, the agent is presented with a visually identical page embedded with hidden, malicious instructions, such as indirect prompt injections. This mechanism allows adversaries to hijack agent behavior, leading to data exfiltration, malware execution, or misinformation propagation, all while remaining completely invisible to human users and conventional security crawlers. This work formalizes the threat model, details the mechanics of agent fingerprinting and cloaking, and discusses the profound security implications for the future of agentic AI, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses against this stealthy and scalable attack.</description>

Abstract: Existing AI Music composition tools are limited in generation duration, musical quality, and controllability. We introduce CoComposer, a multi-agent system that consists of five collaborating agents, each with a task based on the traditional music composition workflow. Using the AudioBox-Aesthetics system, we experimentally evaluate CoComposer on four compositional criteria. We test with three LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3-0324, Gemini-2.5-Flash), and find (1) that CoComposer outperforms existing multi-agent LLM-based systems in music quality, and (2) compared to a single-agent system, in production complexity. Compared to non- LLM MusicLM, CoComposer has better interpretability and editability, although MusicLM still produces better music.</description>

      <title>LLM-based Triplet Extraction for Automated Ontology Generation in Software Engineering Standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ontologies have supported knowledge representation and whitebox reasoning for decades; thus, the automated ontology generation (AOG) plays a crucial role in scaling their use. Software engineering standards (SES) consist of long, unstructured text (with high noise) and paragraphs with domain-specific terms. In this setting, relation triple extraction (RTE), together with term extraction, constitutes the first stage toward AOG. This work proposes an open-source large language model (LLM)-assisted approach to RTE for SES. Instead of solely relying on prompt-engineering-based methods, this study promotes the use of LLMs as an aid in constructing ontologies and explores an effective AOG workflow that includes document segmentation, candidate term mining, LLM-based relation inference, term normalization, and cross-section alignment. Golden-standard benchmarks at three granularities are constructed and used to evaluate the ontology generated from the study. The results show that it is comparable and potentially superior to the OpenIE method of triple extraction.</description>

      <title>Scaling Legal AI: Benchmarking Mamba and Transformers for Statutory Classification and Case Law Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of statutory corpora and judicial decisions requires scalable legal AI systems capable of classification and retrieval over extremely long contexts. Transformer-based architectures (e.g., Longformer, DeBERTa) dominate current legal NLP benchmarks but struggle with quadratic attention costs, limiting efficiency and scalability. In this work, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking of Mamba, a state-space model (SSM) with linear-time selective mechanisms, against leading transformer models for statutory classification and case law retrieval. We evaluate models on open-source legal corpora including LexGLUE, EUR-Lex, and ILDC, covering statutory tagging, judicial outcome prediction, and case retrieval tasks. Metrics include accuracy, recall at k, mean reciprocal rank (MRR), and normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG), alongside throughput measured in tokens per second and maximum context length. Results show that Mamba's linear scaling enables processing of legal documents several times longer than transformers, while maintaining or surpassing retrieval and classification performance. This study introduces a new legal NLP benchmark suite for long-context modeling, along with open-source code and datasets to support reproducibility. Our findings highlight trade-offs between state-space models and transformers, providing guidance for deploying scalable legal AI in statutory analysis, judicial decision support, and policy research.</description>

      <title>Pilot Study on Generative AI and Critical Thinking in Higher Education Classrooms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GAI) tools have seen rapid adoption in educational settings, yet their role in fostering critical thinking remains underexplored. While previous studies have examined GAI as a tutor for specific lessons or as a tool for completing assignments, few have addressed how students critically evaluate the accuracy and appropriateness of GAI-generated responses. This pilot study investigates students' ability to apply structured critical thinking when assessing Generative AI outputs in introductory Computational and Data Science courses. Given that GAI tools often produce contextually flawed or factually incorrect answers, we designed learning activities that require students to analyze, critique, and revise AI-generated solutions. Our findings offer initial insights into students' ability to engage critically with GAI content and lay the groundwork for more comprehensive studies in future semesters.</description>

      <title>Principled Approximation Methods for Efficient and Scalable Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in deep learning has been driven by increasingly larger models. However, their computational and energy demands have grown proportionally, creating significant barriers to their deployment and to a wider adoption of deep learning technologies. This thesis investigates principled approximation methods for improving the efficiency of deep learning systems, with a particular focus on settings that involve discrete constraints and non-differentiability.
  We study three main approaches toward improved efficiency: architecture design, model compression, and optimization. For model compression, we propose novel approximations for pruning and quantization that frame the underlying discrete problem as continuous and differentiable, enabling gradient-based training of compression schemes alongside the model's parameters. These approximations allow for fine-grained sparsity and precision configurations, leading to highly compact models without significant fine-tuning. In the context of architecture design, we design an algorithm for neural architecture search that leverages parameter sharing across layers to efficiently explore implicitly recurrent architectures. Finally, we study adaptive optimization, revisiting theoretical properties of widely used methods and proposing an adaptive optimizer that allows for quick hyperparameter tuning.
  Our contributions center on tackling computationally hard problems via scalable and principled approximations. Experimental results on image classification, language modeling, and generative modeling tasks show that the proposed methods provide significant improvements in terms of training and inference efficiency while maintaining, or even improving, the model's performance.</description>

      <title>Waste-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating VLLMs in Cluttered Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) capable of performing a wide range of visual understanding tasks. While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance on standard natural images, their capabilities have not been thoroughly explored in cluttered datasets where there is complex environment having deformed shaped objects. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset specifically designed for waste classification in real-world scenarios, characterized by complex environments and deformed shaped objects. Along with this dataset, we present an in-depth evaluation approach to rigorously assess the robustness and accuracy of VLLMs. The introduced dataset and comprehensive analysis provide valuable insights into the performance of VLLMs under challenging conditions. Our findings highlight the critical need for further advancements in VLLM's robustness to perform better in complex environments. The dataset and code for our experiments will be made publicly available.</description>

Abstract: Over the past decades, alongside advancements in natural language processing, significant attention has been paid to training models to automatically extract, understand, test, and generate hypotheses in open and scientific domains. However, interpretations of the term \emph{hypothesis} for various natural language understanding (NLU) tasks have migrated from traditional definitions in the natural, social, and formal sciences. Even within NLU, we observe differences defining hypotheses across literature. In this paper, we overview and delineate various definitions of hypothesis. Especially, we discern the nuances of definitions across recently published NLU tasks. We highlight the importance of well-structured and well-defined hypotheses, particularly as we move toward a machine-interpretable scholarly record.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid advancements in generative modeling have made synthetic audio generation easy, making speech-based services vulnerable to spoofing attacks. Consequently, there is a dire need for robust countermeasures more than ever. Existing solutions for deepfake detection are often criticized for lacking generalizability and fail drastically when applied to real-world data. This study proposes a novel method for generalizable spoofing detection leveraging non-semantic universal audio representations. Extensive experiments have been performed to find suitable non-semantic features using TRILL and TRILLsson models. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance on the in-domain test set while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches on out-of-domain test sets. Notably, it demonstrates superior generalization on public-domain data, surpassing methods based on hand-crafted features, semantic embeddings, and end-to-end architectures.</description>

      <title>Explainable Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: An Empirical Analysis on State-Aware Reasoning Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting have enabled large language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step reasoning. However, the explainability of such reasoning remains limited, with prior work primarily focusing on local token-level attribution, such that the high-level semantic roles of reasoning steps and their transitions remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a state-aware transition framework that abstracts CoT trajectories into structured latent dynamics. Specifically, to capture the evolving semantics of CoT reasoning, each reasoning step is represented via spectral analysis of token-level embeddings and clustered into semantically coherent latent states. To characterize the global structure of reasoning, we model their progression as a Markov chain, yielding a structured and interpretable view of the reasoning process. This abstraction supports a range of analyses, including semantic role identification, temporal pattern visualization, and consistency evaluation.</description>

      <title>Beyond Pixels: Introducing Geometric-Semantic World Priors for Video-based Embodied Models via Spatio-temporal Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence. While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model. Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic, implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate 1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional approaches.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Deep Learning for Phyllodes Tumor Classification from Ultrasound and Clinical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions that are difficult to classify preoperatively due to their radiological similarity to benign fibroadenomas. This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions. To address this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates breast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve diagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts and fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and 0.7294, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and improving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.</description>

      <title>First Order Model-Based RL through Decoupled Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is growing interest in reinforcement learning (RL) methods that leverage the simulator's derivatives to improve learning efficiency. While early gradient-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance compared to derivative-free methods, accessing simulator gradients is often impractical due to their implementation cost or unavailability. Model-based RL (MBRL) can approximate these gradients via learned dynamics models, but the solver efficiency suffers from compounding prediction errors during training rollouts, which can degrade policy performance. We propose an approach that decouples trajectory generation from gradient computation: trajectories are unrolled using a simulator, while gradients are computed via backpropagation through a learned differentiable model of the simulator. This hybrid design enables efficient and consistent first-order policy optimization, even when simulator gradients are unavailable, as well as learning a critic from simulation rollouts, which is more accurate. Our method achieves the sample efficiency and speed of specialized optimizers such as SHAC, while maintaining the generality of standard approaches like PPO and avoiding ill behaviors observed in other first-order MBRL methods. We empirically validate our algorithm on benchmark control tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real Go2 quadruped robot, across both quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion tasks.</description>

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of three advanced speech encoder models, Wav2Vec 2.0, XLS-R, and Whisper, in speaker identification tasks. By fine-tuning these models and analyzing their layer-wise representations using SVCCA, k-means clustering, and t-SNE visualizations, we found that Wav2Vec 2.0 and XLS-R capture speaker-specific features effectively in their early layers, with fine-tuning improving stability and performance. Whisper showed better performance in deeper layers. Additionally, we determined the optimal number of transformer layers for each model when fine-tuned for speaker identification tasks.</description>

      <title>Criteria for Credible AI-assisted Carbon Footprinting Systems: The Cases of Mapping and Lifecycle Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As organizations face increasing pressure to understand their corporate and products' carbon footprints, artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted calculation systems for footprinting are proliferating, but with widely varying levels of rigor and transparency. Standards and guidance have not kept pace with the technology; evaluation datasets are nascent; and statistical approaches to uncertainty analysis are not yet practical to apply to scaled systems. We present a set of criteria to validate AI-assisted systems that calculate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for products and materials. We implement a three-step approach: (1) Identification of needs and constraints, (2) Draft criteria development and (3) Refinements through pilots. The process identifies three use cases of AI applications: Case 1 focuses on AI-assisted mapping to existing datasets for corporate GHG accounting and product hotspotting, automating repetitive manual tasks while maintaining mapping quality. Case 2 addresses AI systems that generate complete product models for corporate decision-making, which require comprehensive validation of both component tasks and end-to-end performance. We discuss the outlook for Case 3 applications, systems that generate standards-compliant models. We find that credible AI systems can be built and that they should be validated using system-level evaluations rather than line-item review, with metrics such as benchmark performance, indications of data quality and uncertainty, and transparent documentation. This approach may be used as a foundation for practitioners, auditors, and standards bodies to evaluate AI-assisted environmental assessment tools. By establishing evaluation criteria that balance scalability with credibility requirements, our approach contributes to the field's efforts to develop appropriate standards for AI-assisted carbon footprinting systems.</description>

      <title>The Differential Meaning of Models: A Framework for Analyzing the Structural Consequences of Semantic Modeling Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of methods for modeling of human meaning-making constitutes a powerful class of instruments for the analysis of complex semiotic systems. However, the field lacks a general theoretical framework for describing these modeling practices across various model types in an apples-to-apples way. In this paper, we propose such a framework grounded in the semiotic theory of C. S. Peirce. We argue that such models measure latent symbol geometries, which can be understood as hypotheses about the complex of semiotic agencies underlying a symbolic dataset. Further, we argue that in contexts where a model's value cannot be straightforwardly captured by proxy measures of performance, models can instead be understood relationally, so that the particular interpretive lens of a model becomes visible through its contrast with other models. This forms the basis of a theory of model semantics in which models, and the modeling decisions that constitute them, are themselves treated as signs. In addition to proposing the framework, we illustrate its empirical use with a few brief examples and consider foundational questions and future directions enabled by the framework.</description>

      <title>Revealing Hidden Precursors to Earthquakes via a Stress-Sensitive Transformation of Seismic Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earthquake prediction has long been one of the most elusive challenges in science. Laboratory experiments and simulations suggest that failure precursors should exist, yet reliable signals have remained unobserved in real-world seismic records, leaving open the question of whether they are absent in nature or simply hidden within noise. Here we introduce a stress-sensitive frequency-domain transformation that tracks energy differences between adjacent frequency bands, isolating subtle spectral changes linked to evolving shear and normal stress. Applied to both laboratory acoustic emission data and seismic records from seven major earthquakes (Mw 5.9-9.0), including the 2011 Tohoku and 2023 Turkey-Syria events, the transform consistently reveals precursory signatures, arc-like trajectories and accelerations toward extrema, emerging hours to days before rupture. These features are robust across diverse tectonic settings, from induced seismicity and volcanic collapse to continental strike-slip and subduction megathrust earthquakes. Our findings demonstrate that hidden precursors are indeed encoded in ambient seismic noise, offering a pathway toward real-time fault monitoring and actionable short-term earthquake forecasting.</description>

      <title>SABER: A SQL-Compatible Semantic Document Processing System Based on Extended Relational Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of large-language models (LLMs) has enabled a new class of semantic data processing systems (SDPSs) to support declarative queries against unstructured documents. Existing SDPSs are, however, lacking a unified algebraic foundation, making their queries difficult to compose, reason, and optimize. We propose a new semantic algebra, SABER (Semantic Algebra Based on Extended Relational algebra), opening the possibility of semantic operations' logical plan construction, optimization, and formal correctness guarantees. We further propose to implement SABER in a SQL-compatible syntax so that it natively supports mixed structured/unstructured data processing. With SABER, we showcase the feasibility of providing a unified interface for existing SDPSs so that it can effectively mix and match any semantically-compatible operator implementation from any SDPS, greatly enhancing SABER's applicability for community contributions.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Industrial Contour Detection: A Language-Guided Vision System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial computer vision systems often struggle with noise, material variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting the effectiveness of classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines. In this work, we present a language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in manufacturing, designed to achieve CAD-level precision. The system is organized into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using a conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language modeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process and applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack datasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge continuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. For the refinement stage, we benchmarked several vision-language models, including Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided workflow, and open-source baselines. Under standardized conditions, GPT-image-1 consistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in both structural accuracy and perceptual quality. These findings demonstrate the promise of VLM-guided generative workflows for advancing industrial computer vision beyond the limitations of classical pipelines.</description>

      <title>OpinioRAG: Towards Generating User-Centric Opinion Highlights from Large-scale Online Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of opinion highlights generation from large volumes of user reviews, often exceeding thousands per entity, where existing methods either fail to scale or produce generic, one-size-fits-all summaries that overlook personalized needs. To tackle this, we introduce OpinioRAG, a scalable, training-free framework that combines RAG-based evidence retrieval with LLMs to efficiently produce tailored summaries. Additionally, we propose novel reference-free verification metrics designed for sentiment-rich domains, where accurately capturing opinions and sentiment alignment is essential. These metrics offer a fine-grained, context-sensitive assessment of factual consistency. To facilitate evaluation, we contribute the first large-scale dataset of long-form user reviews, comprising entities with over a thousand reviews each, paired with unbiased expert summaries and manually annotated queries. Through extensive experiments, we identify key challenges, provide actionable insights into improving systems, pave the way for future research, and position OpinioRAG as a robust framework for generating accurate, relevant, and structured summaries at scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellite Communication (SatCom) networks represent a fundamental pillar in modern global connectivity, facilitating reliable service and extensive coverage across a plethora of applications. The expanding demand for high-bandwidth services and the proliferation of mega satellite constellations highlight the limitations of traditional exclusive satellite spectrum allocation approaches. Cognitive Radio (CR) leading to Cognitive Satellite (CogSat) networks through Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM), which enables the dynamic adaptability of radio equipment to environmental conditions for optimal performance, presents a promising solution for the emerging spectrum scarcity. In this survey, we explore the adaptation of intelligent DSM methodologies to SatCom, leveraging satellite network integrations. We discuss contributions and hurdles in regulations and standardizations in realizing intelligent DSM in SatCom, and deep dive into DSM techniques, which enable CogSat networks. Furthermore, we extensively evaluate and categorize state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) methods leveraged for DSM while exploring operational resilience and robustness of such integrations. In addition, performance evaluation metrics critical for adaptive resource management and system optimization in CogSat networks are thoroughly investigated. This survey also identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions in regulatory frameworks, network architectures, and intelligent spectrum management, paving the way for sustainable and scalable SatCom networks for enhanced global connectivity.</description>

Abstract: We present the LLM ORDER BY operator as a logical abstraction and study its physical implementations within a unified evaluation framework. Our experiments show that no single approach is universally optimal, with effectiveness depending on query characteristics and data. We introduce three new designs: an agreement-based batch-size policy, a majority voting mechanism for pairwise sorting, and a two-way external merge sort adapted for LLMs. With extensive experiments, our agreement-based procedure is effective at determining batch size for value-based methods, the majority-voting mechanism consistently strengthens pairwise comparisons on GPT-4o, and external merge sort achieves high accuracy-efficiency trade-offs across datasets and models. We further observe a log-linear scaling between compute cost and ordering quality, offering the first step toward principled cost models for LLM powered data systems.</description>

      <title>TReF-6: Inferring Task-Relevant Frames from a Single Demonstration for One-Shot Skill Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots often struggle to generalize from a single demonstration due to the lack of a transferable and interpretable spatial representation. In this work, we introduce TReF-6, a method that infers a simplified, abstracted 6DoF Task-Relevant Frame from a single trajectory. Our approach identifies an influence point purely from the trajectory geometry to define the origin for a local frame, which serves as a reference for parameterizing a Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP). This influence point captures the task's spatial structure, extending the standard DMP formulation beyond start-goal imitation. The inferred frame is semantically grounded via a vision-language model and localized in novel scenes by Grounded-SAM, enabling functionally consistent skill generalization. We validate TReF-6 in simulation and demonstrate robustness to trajectory noise. We further deploy an end-to-end pipeline on real-world manipulation tasks, showing that TReF-6 supports one-shot imitation learning that preserves task intent across diverse object configurations.</description>

      <title>Continuously Tempered Diffusion Samplers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Annealing-based neural samplers seek to amortize sampling from unnormalized distributions by training neural networks to transport a family of densities interpolating from source to target. A crucial design choice in the training phase of such samplers is the proposal distribution by which locations are generated at which to evaluate the loss. Previous work has obtained such a proposal distribution by combining a partially learned transport with annealed Langevin dynamics. However, isolated modes and other pathological properties of the annealing path imply that such proposals achieve insufficient exploration and thereby lower performance post training. To remedy this, we propose continuously tempered diffusion samplers, which leverage exploration techniques developed in the context of molecular dynamics to improve proposal distributions. Specifically, a family of distributions across different temperatures is introduced to lower energy barriers at higher temperatures and drive exploration at the lower temperature of interest. We empirically validate improved sampler performance driven by extended exploration. Code is available at https://github.com/eje24/ctds.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Task and Motion Planning based on Expanding AND/OR Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robot autonomy in space environments presents unique challenges, including high perception and motion uncertainty, strict kinematic constraints, and limited opportunities for human intervention. Therefore, Task and Motion Planning (TMP) may be critical for autonomous servicing, surface operations, or even in-orbit missions, just to name a few, as it models tasks as discrete action sequencing integrated with continuous motion feasibility assessments. In this paper, we introduce a TMP framework based on expanding AND/OR graphs, referred to as TMP-EAOG, and demonstrate its adaptability to different scenarios. TMP-EAOG encodes task-level abstractions within an AND/OR graph, which expands iteratively as the plan is executed, and performs in-the-loop motion planning assessments to ascertain their feasibility. As a consequence, TMP-EAOG is characterised by the desirable properties of (i) robustness to a certain degree of uncertainty, because AND/OR graph expansion can accommodate for unpredictable information about the robot environment, (ii) controlled autonomy, since an AND/OR graph can be validated by human experts, and (iii) bounded flexibility, in that unexpected events, including the assessment of unfeasible motions, can lead to different courses of action as alternative paths in the AND/OR graph. We evaluate TMP-EAOG on two benchmark domains. We use a simulated mobile manipulator as a proxy for space-grade autonomous robots. Our evaluation shows that TMP-EAOG can deal with a wide range of challenges in the benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Contact-Aided Navigation of Flexible Robotic Endoscope Using Deep Reinforcement Learning in Dynamic Stomach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigating a flexible robotic endoscope (FRE) through the gastrointestinal tract is critical for surgical diagnosis and treatment. However, navigation in the dynamic stomach is particularly challenging because the FRE must learn to effectively use contact with the deformable stomach walls to reach target locations. To address this, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based Contact-Aided Navigation (CAN) strategy for FREs, leveraging contact force feedback to enhance motion stability and navigation precision. The training environment is established using a physics-based finite element method (FEM) simulation of a deformable stomach. Trained with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, our approach achieves high navigation success rates (within 3 mm error between the FRE's end-effector and target) and significantly outperforms baseline policies. In both static and dynamic stomach environments, the CAN agent achieved a 100% success rate with 1.6 mm average error, and it maintained an 85% success rate in challenging unseen scenarios with stronger external disturbances. These results validate that the DRL-based CAN strategy substantially enhances FRE navigation performance over prior methods.</description>

      <title>Jacobian Exploratory Dual-Phase Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Endoluminal Navigation of Deformable Continuum Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deformable continuum robots (DCRs) present unique planning challenges due to nonlinear deformation mechanics and partial state observability, violating the Markov assumptions of conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. While Jacobian-based approaches offer theoretical foundations for rigid manipulators, their direct application to DCRs remains limited by time-varying kinematics and underactuated deformation dynamics. This paper proposes Jacobian Exploratory Dual-Phase RL (JEDP-RL), a framework that decomposes planning into phased Jacobian estimation and policy execution. During each training step, we first perform small-scale local exploratory actions to estimate the deformation Jacobian matrix, then augment the state representation with Jacobian features to restore approximate Markovianity. Extensive SOFA surgical dynamic simulations demonstrate JEDP-RL's three key advantages over proximal policy optimization (PPO) baselines: 1) Convergence speed: 3.2x faster policy convergence, 2) Navigation efficiency: requires 25% fewer steps to reach the target, and 3) Generalization ability: achieve 92% success rate under material property variations and achieve 83% (33% higher than PPO) success rate in the unseen tissue environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) has the potential to enable effective decision-making over long timescales. Existing approaches, while promising, have yet to realize the benefits of large-scale training. In this work, we identify and solve several key challenges in scaling hierarchical RL to high-throughput environments. We propose Scalable Option Learning (SOL), a highly scalable hierarchical RL algorithm which achieves a 25x higher throughput compared to existing hierarchical methods. We train our hierarchical agents using 20 billion frames of experience on the complex game of NetHack, significantly surpassing flat agents and demonstrating positive scaling trends. We also validate our algorithm on MiniHack and Mujoco environments, showcasing its general applicability. Our code is open sourced at github.com/facebookresearch/sol.</description>

      <title>LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion: Enhancing Generalization in Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is known for its strong decision-making capabilities and has been widely applied in various real-world scenarios. However, with the increasing availability of offline datasets and the lack of well-designed online environments from human experts, the challenge of generalization in offline RL has become more prominent. Due to the limitations of offline data, RL agents trained solely on collected experiences often struggle to generalize to new tasks or environments. To address this challenge, we propose LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion (LLMDPD), a novel approach that enhances generalization in offline RL using task-specific prompts. Our method incorporates both text-based task descriptions and trajectory prompts to guide policy learning. We leverage a large language model (LLM) to process text-based prompts, utilizing its natural language understanding and extensive knowledge base to provide rich task-relevant context. Simultaneously, we encode trajectory prompts using a transformer model, capturing structured behavioral patterns within the underlying transition dynamics. These prompts serve as conditional inputs to a context-aware policy-level diffusion model, enabling the RL agent to generalize effectively to unseen tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMDPD outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods on unseen tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving generalization and adaptability in diverse settings.</description>

      <title>Theory Foundation of Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intensive studies have been conducted in recent years to integrate neural networks with physics models to balance model accuracy and interpretability. One recently proposed approach, named Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning (PERL), is to use learning to estimate the residual between the physics model prediction and the ground truth. Numeral examples suggested that integrating such residual with physics models in PERL has three advantages: (1) a reduction in the number of required neural network parameters; (2) faster convergence rates; and (3) fewer training samples needed for the same computational precision. However, these numerical results lack theoretical justification and cannot be adequately explained.
  This paper aims to explain these advantages of PERL from a theoretical perspective. We investigate a general class of problems with Lipschitz continuity properties. By examining the relationships between the bounds to the loss function and residual learning structure, this study rigorously proves a set of theorems explaining the three advantages of PERL.
  Several numerical examples in the context of automated vehicle trajectory prediction are conducted to illustrate the proposed theorems. The results confirm that, even with significantly fewer training samples, PERL consistently achieves higher accuracy than a pure neural network. These results demonstrate the practical value of PERL in real world autonomous driving applications where corner case data are costly or hard to obtain. PERL therefore improves predictive performance while reducing the amount of data required.</description>

      <title>Target-Oriented Single Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization (SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority. This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target environments with unseen data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Air pollution monitoring in resource-constrained regions remains challenging due to sparse sensor deployment and limited infrastructure. This work introduces AQFusionNet, a multimodal deep learning framework for robust Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction. The framework integrates ground-level atmospheric imagery with pollutant concentration data using lightweight CNN backbones (MobileNetV2, ResNet18, EfficientNet-B0). Visual and sensor features are combined through semantically aligned embedding spaces, enabling accurate and efficient prediction. Experiments on more than 8,000 samples from India and Nepal demonstrate that AQFusionNet consistently outperforms unimodal baselines, achieving up to 92.02% classification accuracy and an RMSE of 7.70 with the EfficientNet-B0 backbone. The model delivers an 18.5% improvement over single-modality approaches while maintaining low computational overhead, making it suitable for deployment on edge devices. AQFusionNet provides a scalable and practical solution for AQI monitoring in infrastructure-limited environments, offering robust predictive capability even under partial sensor availability.</description>

      <title>SurgLLM: A Versatile Large Multimodal Model with Spatial Focus and Temporal Awareness for Surgical Video Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness. Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM. Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks, including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness of our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding.

      <title>Activation Steering Meets Preference Optimization: Defense Against Jailbreaks in Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM (\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research. \textcolor{red}{Warning: This paper may contain examples of offensive or harmful text and images.}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to go beyond simple factual queries toward Deep Research-tasks that require decomposing questions into sub-problems, coordinating multi-step reasoning, and synthesizing evidence from diverse sources. We formalize Deep Research tasks with verifiable answers as Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (HCSPs), which are fundamentally different from single-constraint, multi-hop, or flat CSP formulations. However, existing benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions, HotpotQA) fail to capture this complexity, while recent synthetic datasets often introduce shortcut reasoning, knowledge leakage, or lack sufficient structural depth. To address this gap, we introduce InfoSeek, a scalable framework for synthesizing complex Deep Research tasks. InfoSeek uses a dual-agent system to recursively build a Research Tree from large-scale webpages, blurring intermediate nodes into valid sub-problems, and converting these trees into natural language questions that require traversing the full hierarchy. It also enables rapid scaling, yielding over 50K training examples, a curated test set, and reasoning trajectories generated via reject sampling. Experiments show that models trained on InfoSeek consistently outperform strong baselines. On a challenging benchmark BrowseComp-Plus, 3B LLMs optimized with InfoSeek surpass much larger 32B models and lightweight commercial APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Flash), while achieving performance comparable to stronger APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Pro). By preserving meta-information such as intermediate steps and retrieval labels, InfoSeek further supports advanced optimization strategies, including compound reward design and trajectory-level exploration. We provide our codes and datasets in \href{https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/InfoSeek}{this repository}.</description>

      <title>Unifying Adversarial Perturbation for Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to adversarial attacks on node features and graph structure. Various methods have implemented adversarial training to augment graph data, aiming to bolster the robustness and generalization of GNNs. These methods typically involve applying perturbations to the node feature, weights, or graph structure and subsequently minimizing the loss by learning more robust graph model parameters under the adversarial perturbations. Despite the effectiveness of adversarial training in enhancing GNNs' robustness and generalization abilities, its application has been largely confined to specific datasets and GNN types. In this paper, we propose a novel method, PerturbEmbedding, that integrates adversarial perturbation and training, enhancing GNNs' resilience to such attacks and improving their generalization ability. PerturbEmbedding performs perturbation operations directly on every hidden embedding of GNNs and provides a unified framework for most existing perturbation strategies/methods. We also offer a unified perspective on the forms of perturbations, namely random and adversarial perturbations. Through experiments on various datasets using different backbone models, we demonstrate that PerturbEmbedding significantly improves both the robustness and generalization abilities of GNNs, outperforming existing methods. The rejection of both random (non-targeted) and adversarial (targeted) perturbations further enhances the backbone model's performance.</description>

      <title>Beyond Negative Transfer: Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) leverages user behaviors across domains to enhance recommendation quality. However, naive aggregation of sequential signals can introduce conflicting domain-specific preferences, leading to negative transfer. While Sequential Recommendation (SR) already suffers from noisy behaviors such as misclicks and impulsive actions, CDSR further amplifies this issue due to domain heterogeneity arising from diverse item types and user intents. The core challenge is disentangling three intertwined signals: domain-invariant preferences, domain-specific preferences, and noise. Diffusion Models (DMs) offer a generative denoising framework well-suited for disentangling complex user preferences and enhancing robustness to noise. Their iterative refinement process enables gradual denoising, making them effective at capturing subtle preference signals. However, existing applications in recommendation face notable limitations: sequential DMs often conflate shared and domain-specific preferences, while cross-domain collaborative filtering DMs neglect temporal dynamics, limiting their ability to model evolving user preferences. To bridge these gaps, we propose \textbf{DPG-Diff}, a novel Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion Model, the first diffusion-based approach tailored for CDSR, to or best knowledge. DPG-Diff decomposes user preferences into domain-invariant and domain-specific components, which jointly guide the reverse diffusion process. This disentangled guidance enables robust cross-domain knowledge transfer, mitigates negative transfer, and filters sequential noise. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DPG-Diff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics.</description>

      <title>The Resurgence of GCG Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial prompting, such as the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) algorithm, has emerged as a powerful method for jailbreaking large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we present a systematic appraisal of GCG and its annealing-augmented variant, T-GCG, across open-source LLMs of varying scales. Using Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, and GPT-OSS-20B, we evaluate attack effectiveness on both safety-oriented prompts (AdvBench) and reasoning-intensive coding prompts. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) attack success rates (ASR) decrease with model size, reflecting the increasing complexity and non-convexity of larger models' loss landscapes; (2) prefix-based heuristics substantially overestimate attack effectiveness compared to GPT-4o semantic judgments, which provide a stricter and more realistic evaluation; and (3) coding-related prompts are significantly more vulnerable than adversarial safety prompts, suggesting that reasoning itself can be exploited as an attack vector. In addition, preliminary results with T-GCG show that simulated annealing can diversify adversarial search and achieve competitive ASR under prefix evaluation, though its benefits under semantic judgment remain limited. Together, these findings highlight the scalability limits of GCG, expose overlooked vulnerabilities in reasoning tasks, and motivate further development of annealing-inspired strategies for more robust adversarial evaluation.</description>

      <title>DAOVI: Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Omnidirectional videos that capture the entire surroundings are employed in a variety of fields such as VR applications and remote sensing. However, their wide field of view often causes unwanted objects to appear in the videos. This problem can be addressed by video inpainting, which enables the natural removal of such objects while preserving both spatial and temporal consistency. Nevertheless, most existing methods assume processing ordinary videos with a narrow field of view and do not tackle the distortion in equirectangular projection of omnidirectional videos. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting, called Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). DAOVI introduces a module that evaluates temporal motion information in the image space considering geodesic distance, as well as a depth-aware feature propagation module in the feature space that is designed to address the geometric distortion inherent to omnidirectional videos. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.</description>

      <title>A Study on the Framework for Evaluating the Ethics and Trustworthiness of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study provides an in_depth analysis of the ethical and trustworthiness challenges emerging alongside the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and proposes a comprehensive framework for their systematic evaluation. While generative AI, such as ChatGPT, demonstrates remarkable innovative potential, it simultaneously raises ethical and social concerns, including bias, harmfulness, copyright infringement, privacy violations, and hallucination. Current AI evaluation methodologies, which mainly focus on performance and accuracy, are insufficient to address these multifaceted issues. Thus, this study emphasizes the need for new human_centered criteria that also reflect social impact. To this end, it identifies key dimensions for evaluating the ethics and trustworthiness of generative AI_fairness, transparency, accountability, safety, privacy, accuracy, consistency, robustness, explainability, copyright and intellectual property protection, and source traceability and develops detailed indicators and assessment methodologies for each. Moreover, it provides a comparative analysis of AI ethics policies and guidelines in South Korea, the United States, the European Union, and China, deriving key approaches and implications from each. The proposed framework applies across the AI lifecycle and integrates technical assessments with multidisciplinary perspectives, thereby offering practical means to identify and manage ethical risks in real_world contexts. Ultimately, the study establishes an academic foundation for the responsible advancement of generative AI and delivers actionable insights for policymakers, developers, users, and other stakeholders, supporting the positive societal contributions of AI technologies.</description>

      <title>Curriculum Guided Personalized Subgraph Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subgraph Federated Learning (FL) aims to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) across distributed private subgraphs, but it suffers from severe data heterogeneity. To mitigate data heterogeneity, weighted model aggregation personalizes each local GNN by assigning larger weights to parameters from clients with similar subgraph characteristics inferred from their current model states. However, the sparse and biased subgraphs often trigger rapid overfitting, causing the estimated client similarity matrix to stagnate or even collapse. As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce their own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available. To this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called Curriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL). On the client side, CUFL adopts Curriculum Learning (CL) that adaptively selects edges for training according to their reconstruction scores, exposing each GNN first to easier, generic cross-client substructures and only later to harder, client-specific ones. This paced exposure prevents early overfitting to biased patterns and enables gradual personalization. By regulating personalization, the curriculum also reshapes server aggregation from exchanging generic knowledge to propagating client-specific knowledge. Further, CUFL improves weighted aggregation by estimating client similarity using fine-grained structural indicators reconstructed on a random reference graph. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets confirm that CUFL achieves superior performance compared to relevant baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/Kang-Min-Ku/CUFL.git.</description>

      <title>MedSEBA: Synthesizing Evidence-Based Answers Grounded in Evolving Medical Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the digital age, people often turn to the Internet in search of medical advice and recommendations. With the increasing volume of online content, it has become difficult to distinguish reliable sources from misleading information. Similarly, millions of medical studies are published every year, making it challenging for researchers to keep track of the latest scientific findings. These evolving studies can reach differing conclusions, which is not reflected in traditional search tools. To address these challenges, we introduce MedSEBA, an interactive AI-powered system for synthesizing evidence-based answers to medical questions. It utilizes the power of Large Language Models to generate coherent and expressive answers, but grounds them in trustworthy medical studies dynamically retrieved from the research database PubMed. The answers consist of key points and arguments, which can be traced back to respective studies. Notably, the platform also provides an overview of the extent to which the most relevant studies support or refute the given medical claim, and a visualization of how the research consensus evolved through time. Our user study revealed that medical experts and lay users find the system usable and helpful, and the provided answers trustworthy and informative. This makes the system well-suited for both everyday health questions and advanced research insights.</description>

      <title>TECP: Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for open-ended language generation remains a critical yet underexplored challenge, especially under black-box constraints where internal model signals are inaccessible. In this paper, we introduce Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction (TECP), a novel framework that leverages token-level entropy as a logit-free, reference-free uncertainty measure and integrates it into a split conformal prediction (CP) pipeline to construct prediction sets with formal coverage guarantees. Unlike existing approaches that rely on semantic consistency heuristics or white-box features, TECP directly estimates epistemic uncertainty from the token entropy structure of sampled generations and calibrates uncertainty thresholds via CP quantiles to ensure provable error control. Empirical evaluations across six large language models and two benchmarks (CoQA and TriviaQA) demonstrate that TECP consistently achieves reliable coverage and compact prediction sets, outperforming prior self-consistency-based UQ methods. Our method provides a principled and efficient solution for trustworthy generation in black-box LLM settings.</description>

      <title>Embodied Spatial Intelligence: from Implicit Scene Modeling to Spatial Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis introduces "Embodied Spatial Intelligence" to address the challenge of creating robots that can perceive and act in the real world based on natural language instructions. To bridge the gap between Large Language Models (LLMs) and physical embodiment, we present contributions on two fronts: scene representation and spatial reasoning. For perception, we develop robust, scalable, and accurate scene representations using implicit neural models, with contributions in self-supervised camera calibration, high-fidelity depth field generation, and large-scale reconstruction. For spatial reasoning, we enhance the spatial capabilities of LLMs by introducing a novel navigation benchmark, a method for grounding language in 3D, and a state-feedback mechanism to improve long-horizon decision-making. This work lays a foundation for robots that can robustly perceive their surroundings and intelligently act upon complex, language-based commands.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain Malware Detection via Probability-Level Fusion of Lightweight Gradient Boosting Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The escalating sophistication of malware necessitates robust detection mechanisms that generalize across diverse data sources. Traditional single-dataset models struggle with cross-domain generalization and often incur high computational costs. This paper presents a novel, lightweight framework for malware detection that employs probability-level fusion across three distinct datasets: EMBER (static features), API Call Sequences (behavioral features), and CIC Obfuscated Memory (memory patterns). Our method trains individual LightGBM classifiers on each dataset, selects top predictive features to ensure efficiency, and fuses their prediction probabilities using optimized weights determined via grid search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fusion approach achieves a macro F1-score of 0.823 on a cross-domain validation set, significantly outperforming individual models and providing superior generalization. The framework maintains low computational overhead, making it suitable for real-time deployment, and all code and data are provided for full reproducibility.</description>

      <title>A Novel Method to Determine Total Oxidant Concentration Produced by Non-Thermal Plasma Based on Image Processing and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of total oxidant concentration ([Ox]_{tot}) in non-thermal plasma (NTP)-treated aqueous systems remains a critical challenge due to the transient nature of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and the subjectivity of conventional titration methods used for [Ox]_{tot} determination. This study introduces a novel, color-based computer analysis (CBCA) method that integrates advanced image processing with machine learning (ML) to quantify colorimetric shifts in potassium iodide (KI) solutions during oxidation. First, a custom-built visual data acquisition system captured high-resolution video of the color transitions in a KI solution during oxidation with an NTP system. The change in [Ox]_{tot} during the experiments was monitored with a standard titrimetric method. Second, the captured frames were processed using a robust image processing pipeline to extract RGB, HSV, and Lab color features. The extracted features were statistically evaluated, and the results revealed strong linear correlations with the measured [Ox]_{tot} values, particularly in the saturation (HSV), a and b (Lab), and blue (RGB) channels. Subsequently, the [Ox]_{tot} measurements and the extracted color features were used to train and validate five ML models. Among them, linear regression and gradient boosting models achieved the highest predictive accuracy (R^2 &gt; 0.990). It was also found that reducing the feature set from nine to four resulted in comparable performance with improved prediction efficiency, especially for gradient boosting. Finally, comparison of the model predictions with real titration measurements revealed that the CBCA system successfully predicts the [Ox]_{tot} in KI solution with high accuracy (R^2 &gt; 0.998) even with a reduced number of features.</description>

      <title>Talk Less, Call Right: Enhancing Role-Play LLM Agents with Automatic Prompt Optimization and Role Prompting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report investigates approaches for prompting a tool-augmented large language model (LLM) to act as a role-playing dialogue agent in the API track of the Commonsense Persona-grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025. In this setting, dialogue agents often produce overly long in-character responses (over-speaking) while failing to use tools effectively according to the persona (under-acting), such as generating function calls that do not exist or making unnecessary tool calls before answering. We explore four prompting approaches to address these issues: 1) basic role prompting, 2) human-crafted role prompting, 3) automatic prompt optimization (APO), and 4) rule-based role prompting. The rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieved the best performance through two novel techniques--character-card/scene-contract design and strict enforcement of function calling--which led to an overall score of 0.571, improving on the zero-shot baseline score of 0.519. These findings demonstrate that RRP design can substantially improve the effectiveness and reliability of role-playing dialogue agents compared with more elaborate methods such as APO. To support future efforts in developing persona prompts, we are open-sourcing all of our best-performing prompts and the APO tool.

      <title>VideoRewardBench: Comprehensive Evaluation of Multimodal Reward Models for Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal reward models (MRMs) play a crucial role in the training, inference, and evaluation of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by assessing response quality. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding: perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii) except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.</description>

      <title>Multi-Focused Video Group Activities Hashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH (multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.</description>

      <title>ResearchQA: Evaluating Scholarly Question Answering at Scale Across 75 Fields with Survey-Mined Questions and Rubrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating long-form responses to research queries heavily relies on expert annotators, restricting attention to areas like AI where researchers can conveniently enlist colleagues. Yet, research expertise is widespread: survey articles synthesize knowledge distributed across the literature. We introduce ResearchQA, a resource for evaluating LLM systems by distilling survey articles from 75 research fields into 21K queries and 160K rubric items. Each rubric, derived jointly with queries from survey sections, lists query-specific answer evaluation criteria, i.e., citing papers, making explanations, and describing limitations. Assessments by 31 Ph.D. annotators in 8 fields indicate 96% of queries support Ph.D. information needs and 87% of rubric items should be addressed in system responses by a sentence or more. Using our rubrics, we are able to construct an automatic pairwise judge obtaining 74% agreement with expert judgments. We leverage ResearchQA to analyze competency gaps in 18 systems in over 7.6K pairwise evaluations. No parametric or retrieval-augmented system we evaluate exceeds 70% on covering rubric items, and the highest-ranking agentic system shows 75% coverage.

      <title>NeuralSVCD for Efficient Swept Volume Collision Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robot manipulation in unstructured environments requires efficient and reliable Swept Volume Collision Detection (SVCD) for safe motion planning. Traditional discrete methods potentially miss collisions between these points, whereas SVCD continuously checks for collisions along the entire trajectory. Existing SVCD methods typically face a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, limiting practical use. In this paper, we introduce NeuralSVCD, a novel neural encoder-decoder architecture tailored to overcome this trade-off. Our approach leverages shape locality and temporal locality through distributed geometric representations and temporal optimization. This enhances computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Comprehensive experiments show that NeuralSVCD consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art SVCD methods in terms of both collision detection accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating its robust applicability across diverse robotic manipulation scenarios.

      <title>LatentEdit: Adaptive Latent Control for Consistent Semantic Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based Image Editing has achieved significant success in recent years. However, it remains challenging to achieve high-quality image editing while maintaining the background similarity without sacrificing speed or memory efficiency. In this work, we introduce LatentEdit, an adaptive latent fusion framework that dynamically combines the current latent code with a reference latent code inverted from the source image. By selectively preserving source features in high-similarity, semantically important regions while generating target content in other regions guided by the target prompt, LatentEdit enables fine-grained, controllable editing. Critically, the method requires no internal model modifications or complex attention mechanisms, offering a lightweight, plug-and-play solution compatible with both UNet-based and DiT-based architectures. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench dataset demonstrate that our proposed LatentEdit achieves an optimal balance between fidelity and editability, outperforming the state-of-the-art method even in 8-15 steps. Additionally, its inversion-free variant further halves the number of neural function evaluations and eliminates the need for storing any intermediate variables, substantially enhancing real-time deployment efficiency.</description>

      <title>Can AI be Auditable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auditability is defined as the capacity of AI systems to be independently assessed for compliance with ethical, legal, and technical standards throughout their lifecycle. The chapter explores how auditability is being formalized through emerging regulatory frameworks, such as the EU AI Act, which mandate documentation, risk assessments, and governance structures. It analyzes the diverse challenges facing AI auditability, including technical opacity, inconsistent documentation practices, lack of standardized audit tools and metrics, and conflicting principles within existing responsible AI frameworks. The discussion highlights the need for clear guidelines, harmonized international regulations, and robust socio-technical methodologies to operationalize auditability at scale. The chapter concludes by emphasizing the importance of multi-stakeholder collaboration and auditor empowerment in building an effective AI audit ecosystem. It argues that auditability must be embedded in AI development practices and governance infrastructures to ensure that AI systems are not only functional but also ethically and legally aligned.</description>

      <title>KVComp: A High-Performance, LLM-Aware, Lossy Compression Framework for KV Cache</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive potential in various practical applications. However, long context inference poses a significant challenge due to the enormous memory requirements of the key-value (KV) cache, which can scale to multiple gigabytes as sequence length and batch size increase. In this paper, we present KVComp, a generic and efficient KV cache management framework optimized for long-text generation that synergistically works with both latency-critical and throughput-critical inference systems. KVComp employs novel lossy compression techniques specifically designed for KV cache data characteristics, featuring careful co-design of compression algorithms and system architecture. Our approach maintains compatibility with the growing nature of KV cache while preserving high computational efficiency. Experimental results show that KVComp achieves on average 47\% and up to 83\% higher memory reduction rate compared to existing methods with little/no model accuracy degradation. Furthermore, KVComp achieves extremely high execution throughput, effectively reducing decompression overhead and, in some cases, even accelerating the matrix-vector multiplication operation and outperform cuBLAS-based attention kernels with less data movement.</description>

      <title>Federated Survival Analysis with Node-Level Differential Privacy: Private Kaplan-Meier Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how to calculate Kaplan-Meier survival curves across multiple health-care jurisdictions while protecting patient privacy with node-level differential privacy. Each site discloses its curve only once, adding Laplace noise whose scale is determined by the length of the common time grid; the server then averages the noisy curves, so the overall privacy budget remains unchanged. We benchmark four one-shot smoothing techniques: Discrete Cosine Transform, Haar Wavelet shrinkage, adaptive Total-Variation denoising, and a parametric Weibull fit on the NCCTG lung-cancer cohort under five privacy levels and three partition scenarios (uniform, moderately skewed, highly imbalanced). Total-Variation gives the best mean accuracy, whereas the frequency-domain smoothers offer stronger worst-case robustness and the Weibull model shows the most stable behaviour at the strictest privacy setting. Across all methods the released curves keep the empirical log-rank type-I error below fifteen percent for privacy budgets of 0.5 and higher, demonstrating that clinically useful survival information can be shared without iterative training or heavy cryptography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce TimeCopilot, the first open-source agentic framework for forecasting that combines multiple Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) through a single unified API. TimeCopilot automates the forecasting pipeline: feature analysis, model selection, cross-validation, and forecast generation, while providing natural language explanations and supporting direct queries about the future. The framework is LLM-agnostic, compatible with both commercial and open-source models, and supports ensembles across diverse forecasting families. Results on the large-scale GIFT-Eval benchmark show that TimeCopilot achieves state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting performance at low cost. Our framework provides a practical foundation for reproducible, explainable, and accessible agentic forecasting systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Methane Detection Onboard Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change, making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning (ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at https://huggingface.co/datasets/SpaceML/UnorthoDOS , along with code at https://github.com/spaceml-org/plume-hunter.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the Ionosphere from Sparse GNSS Data with Temporal-Fusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ionosphere critically influences Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), satellite communications, and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations, yet accurate prediction of its variability remains challenging due to nonlinear couplings between solar, geomagnetic, and thermospheric drivers. Total Electron Content (TEC), a key ionospheric parameter, is derived from GNSS observations, but its reliable forecasting is limited by the sparse nature of global measurements and the limited accuracy of empirical models, especially during strong space weather conditions. In this work, we present a machine learning framework for ionospheric TEC forecasting that leverages Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) to predict sparse ionosphere data. Our approach accommodates heterogeneous input sources, including solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices, and GNSS-derived vertical TEC, and applies preprocessing and temporal alignment strategies. Experiments spanning 2010-2025 demonstrate that the model achieves robust predictions up to 24 hours ahead, with root mean square errors as low as 3.33 TECU. Results highlight that solar EUV irradiance provides the strongest predictive signals. Beyond forecasting accuracy, the framework offers interpretability through attention-based analysis, supporting both operational applications and scientific discovery. To encourage reproducibility and community-driven development, we release the full implementation as the open-source toolkit \texttt{ionopy}.</description>

      <title>Enabling Trustworthy Federated Learning via Remote Attestation for Mitigating Byzantine Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant attention for its privacy-preserving capabilities, enabling distributed devices to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. However, its distributed nature forces the central server to blindly trust the local training process and aggregate uncertain model updates, making it susceptible to Byzantine attacks from malicious participants, especially in mission-critical scenarios. Detecting such attacks is challenging due to the diverse knowledge across clients, where variations in model updates may stem from benign factors, such as non-IID data, rather than adversarial behavior. Existing data-driven defenses struggle to distinguish malicious updates from natural variations, leading to high false positive rates and poor filtering performance.
  To address this challenge, we propose Sentinel, a remote attestation (RA)-based scheme for FL systems that regains client-side transparency and mitigates Byzantine attacks from a system security perspective. Our system employs code instrumentation to track control-flow and monitor critical variables in the local training process. Additionally, we utilize a trusted training recorder within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to generate an attestation report, which is cryptographically signed and securely transmitted to the server. Upon verification, the server ensures that legitimate client training processes remain free from program behavior violation or data manipulation, allowing only trusted model updates to be aggregated into the global model. Experimental results on IoT devices demonstrate that Sentinel ensures the trustworthiness of the local training integrity with low runtime and memory overhead.</description>

      <title>NMR-Solver: Automated Structure Elucidation via Large-Scale Spectral Matching and Physics-Guided Fragment Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful and widely used tools for molecular structure elucidation in organic chemistry. However, the interpretation of NMR spectra to determine unknown molecular structures remains a labor-intensive and expertise-dependent process, particularly for complex or novel compounds. Although recent methods have been proposed for molecular structure elucidation, they often underperform in real-world applications due to inherent algorithmic limitations and limited high-quality data. Here, we present NMR-Solver, a practical and interpretable framework for the automated determination of small organic molecule structures from $^1$H and $^{13}$C NMR spectra. Our method introduces an automated framework for molecular structure elucidation, integrating large-scale spectral matching with physics-guided fragment-based optimization that exploits atomic-level structure-spectrum relationships in NMR. We evaluate NMR-Solver on simulated benchmarks, curated experimental data from the literature, and real-world experiments, demonstrating its strong generalization, robustness, and practical utility in challenging, real-life scenarios. NMR-Solver unifies computational NMR analysis, deep learning, and interpretable chemical reasoning into a coherent system. By incorporating the physical principles of NMR into molecular optimization, it enables scalable, automated, and chemically meaningful molecular identification, establishing a generalizable paradigm for solving inverse problems in molecular science.</description>

      <title>RAG-PRISM: A Personalized, Rapid, and Immersive Skill Mastery Framework with Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Tutoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid digital transformation of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) systems is reshaping workforce needs, widening skill gaps, especially for older workers. With growing emphasis on STEM skills such as robotics, automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and security, large-scale re-skilling and up-skilling are required. Training programs must address diverse backgrounds, learning styles, and motivations to improve persistence and success, while ensuring rapid, cost-effective workforce development through experiential learning. To meet these challenges, we present an adaptive tutoring framework that combines generative AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver personalized training. The framework leverages document hit rate and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) to optimize content for each learner, and is benchmarked against human-generated training for alignment and relevance. We demonstrate the framework in 4IR cybersecurity learning by creating a synthetic QA dataset emulating trainee behavior, while RAG is tuned on curated cybersecurity materials. Evaluation compares its generated training with manually curated queries representing realistic student interactions. Responses are produced using large language models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, assessed for faithfulness and content alignment. GPT-4 achieves the best performance with 87% relevancy and 100% alignment. Results show this dual-mode approach enables the adaptive tutor to act as both a personalized topic recommender and content generator, offering a scalable solution for rapid, tailored learning in 4IR education and workforce development.</description>

      <title>LLM-HyPZ: Hardware Vulnerability Discovery using an LLM-Assisted Hybrid Platform for Zero-Shot Knowledge Extraction and Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of hardware vulnerabilities has created an urgent need for systematic and scalable analysis methods. Unlike software flaws, which are often patchable post-deployment, hardware weaknesses remain embedded across product lifecycles, posing persistent risks to processors, embedded devices, and IoT platforms. Existing efforts such as the MITRE CWE Hardware List (2021) relied on expert-driven Delphi surveys, which lack statistical rigor and introduce subjective bias, while large-scale data-driven foundations for hardware weaknesses have been largely absent. In this work, we propose LLM-HyPZ, an LLM-assisted hybrid framework for zero-shot knowledge extraction and refinement from vulnerability corpora. Our approach integrates zero-shot LLM classification, contextualized embeddings, unsupervised clustering, and prompt-driven summarization to mine hardware-related CVEs at scale. Applying LLM-HyPZ to the 2021-2024 CVE corpus (114,836 entries), we identified 1,742 hardware-related vulnerabilities. We distilled them into five recurring themes, including privilege escalation via firmware and BIOS, memory corruption in mobile and IoT systems, and physical access exploits. Benchmarking across seven LLMs shows that LLaMA 3.3 70B achieves near-perfect classification accuracy (99.5%) on a curated validation set. Beyond methodological contributions, our framework directly supported the MITRE CWE Most Important Hardware Weaknesses (MIHW) 2025 update by narrowing the candidate search space. Specifically, our pipeline surfaced 411 of the 1,026 CVEs used for downstream MIHW analysis, thereby reducing expert workload and accelerating evidence gathering. These results establish LLM-HyPZ as the first data-driven, scalable approach for systematically discovering hardware vulnerabilities, thereby bridging the gap between expert knowledge and real-world vulnerability evidence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regional weather forecasting is a critical problem for localized climate adaptation, disaster mitigation, and sustainable development. While machine learning has shown impressive progress in global weather forecasting, regional forecasting remains comparatively underexplored. Existing efforts often use different datasets and experimental setups, limiting fair comparison and reproducibility. We introduce IndiaWeatherBench, a comprehensive benchmark for data-driven regional weather forecasting focused on the Indian subcontinent. IndiaWeatherBench provides a curated dataset built from high-resolution regional reanalysis products, along with a suite of deterministic and probabilistic metrics to facilitate consistent training and evaluation. To establish strong baselines, we implement and evaluate a range of models across diverse architectures, including UNets, Transformers, and Graph-based networks, as well as different boundary conditioning strategies and training objectives. While focused on India, IndiaWeatherBench is easily extensible to other geographic regions. We open-source all raw and preprocessed datasets, model implementations, and evaluation pipelines to promote accessibility and future development. We hope IndiaWeatherBench will serve as a foundation for advancing regional weather forecasting research. Code is available at https://github.com/tung-nd/IndiaWeatherBench.</description>

      <title>The Name-Free Gap: Policy-Aware Stylistic Control in Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-music models capture broad attributes such as instrumentation or mood, but fine-grained stylistic control remains an open challenge. Existing stylization methods typically require retraining or specialized conditioning, which complicates reproducibility and limits policy compliance when artist names are restricted. We study whether lightweight, human-readable modifiers sampled from a large language model can provide a policy-robust alternative for stylistic control. Using MusicGen-small, we evaluate two artists: Billie Eilish (vocal pop) and Ludovico Einaudi (instrumental piano). For each artist, we use fifteen reference excerpts and evaluate matched seeds under three conditions: baseline prompts, artist-name prompts, and five descriptor sets. All prompts are generated using a large language model. Evaluation uses both VGGish and CLAP embeddings with distributional and per-clip similarity measures, including a new min-distance attribution metric. Results show that artist names are the strongest control signal across both artists, while name-free descriptors recover much of this effect. This highlights that existing safeguards such as the restriction of artist names in music generation prompts may not fully prevent style imitation. Cross-artist transfers reduce alignment, showing that descriptors encode targeted stylistic cues. We also present a descriptor table across ten contemporary artists to illustrate the breadth of the tokens. Together these findings define the name-free gap, the controllability difference between artist-name prompts and policy-compliant descriptors, shown through a reproducible evaluation protocol for prompt-level controllability.</description>

      <title>Fusion to Enhance: Fusion Visual Encoder to Enhance Multimodal Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods. This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems with stronger perceptual capabilities.</description>

      <title>Confident, Calibrated, or Complicit: Probing the Trade-offs between Safety Alignment and Ideological Bias in Language Models in Detecting Hate Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting implicit and explicit hate speech, examining whether models with minimal safety alignment (uncensored) might provide more objective classification capabilities compared to their heavily-aligned (censored) counterparts. While uncensored models theoretically offer a less constrained perspective free from moral guardrails that could bias classification decisions, our results reveal a surprising trade-off: censored models significantly outperform their uncensored counterparts in both accuracy and robustness, achieving 78.7% versus 64.1% strict accuracy. However, this enhanced performance comes with its own limitation -- the safety alignment acts as a strong ideological anchor, making censored models resistant to persona-based influence, while uncensored models prove highly malleable to ideological framing. Furthermore, we identify critical failures across all models in understanding nuanced language such as irony. We also find alarming fairness disparities in performance across different targeted groups and systemic overconfidence that renders self-reported certainty unreliable. These findings challenge the notion of LLMs as objective arbiters and highlight the need for more sophisticated auditing frameworks that account for fairness, calibration, and ideological consistency.</description>

      <title>Valid Property-Enhanced Contrastive Learning for Targeted Optimization &amp; Resampling for Novel Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficiently steering generative models toward pharmacologically relevant regions of chemical space remains a major obstacle in molecular drug discovery under low-data regimes. We present VECTOR+: Valid-property-Enhanced Contrastive Learning for Targeted Optimization and Resampling, a framework that couples property-guided representation learning with controllable molecule generation. VECTOR+ applies to both regression and classification tasks and enables interpretable, data-efficient exploration of functional chemical space. We evaluate on two datasets: a curated PD-L1 inhibitor set (296 compounds with experimental $IC_{50}$ values) and a receptor kinase inhibitor set (2,056 molecules by binding mode). Despite limited training data, VECTOR+ generates novel, synthetically tractable candidates. Against PD-L1 (PDB 5J89), 100 of 8,374 generated molecules surpass a docking threshold of $-15.0$ kcal/mol, with the best scoring $-17.6$ kcal/mol compared to the top reference inhibitor ($-15.4$ kcal/mol). The best-performing molecules retain the conserved biphenyl pharmacophore while introducing novel motifs. Molecular dynamics (250 ns) confirm binding stability (ligand RMSD &lt; $2.5$ angstroms). VECTOR+ generalizes to kinase inhibitors, producing compounds with stronger docking scores than established drugs such as brigatinib and sorafenib. Benchmarking against JT-VAE and MolGPT across docking, novelty, uniqueness, and Tanimoto similarity highlights the superior performance of our method. These results position our work as a robust, extensible approach for property-conditioned molecular design in low-data settings, bridging contrastive learning and generative modeling for reproducible, AI-accelerated discovery.</description>

      <title>DELTA: Variational Disentangled Learning for Privacy-Preserving Data Reprogramming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real-world applications, domain data often contains identifiable or sensitive attributes, is subject to strict regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR), and requires explicit data feature engineering for interpretability and transparency. Existing feature engineering primarily focuses on advancing downstream task performance, often risking privacy leakage. We generalize this learning task under such new requirements as Privacy-Preserving Data Reprogramming (PPDR): given a dataset, transforming features to maximize target attribute prediction accuracy while minimizing sensitive attribute prediction accuracy. PPDR poses challenges for existing systems: 1) generating high-utility feature transformations without being overwhelmed by a large search space, and 2) disentangling and eliminating sensitive information from utility-oriented features to reduce privacy inferability. To tackle these challenges, we propose DELTA, a two-phase variational disentangled generative learning framework. Phase I uses policy-guided reinforcement learning to discover feature transformations with downstream task utility, without any regard to privacy inferability. Phase II employs a variational LSTM seq2seq encoder-decoder with a utility-privacy disentangled latent space design and adversarial-causal disentanglement regularization to suppress privacy signals during feature generation. Experiments on eight datasets show DELTA improves predictive performance by ~9.3% and reduces privacy leakage by ~35%, demonstrating robust, privacy-aware data transformation.</description>

      <title>Queuing for Civility: Regulating Emotions and Reducing Toxicity in Digital Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pervasiveness of online toxicity, including hate speech and trolling, disrupts digital interactions and online well-being. Previous research has mainly focused on post-hoc moderation, overlooking the real-time emotional dynamics of online conversations and the impact of users' emotions on others. This paper presents a graph-based framework to identify the need for emotion regulation within online conversations. This framework promotes self-reflection to manage emotional responses and encourage responsible behaviour in real time. Additionally, a comment queuing mechanism is proposed to address intentional trolls who exploit emotions to inflame conversations. This mechanism introduces a delay in publishing comments, giving users time to self-regulate before further engaging in the conversation and helping maintain emotional balance. Analysis of social media data from Twitter and Reddit demonstrates that the graph-based framework reduced toxicity by 12%, while the comment queuing mechanism decreased the spread of anger by 15%, with only 4% of comments being temporarily held on average. These findings indicate that combining real-time emotion regulation with delayed moderation can significantly improve well-being in online environments.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Dataset Cleaning Framework for Encrypted Traffic Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic classification, a technique for assigning network flows to predefined categories, has been widely deployed in enterprise and carrier networks. With the massive adoption of mobile devices, encryption is increasingly used in mobile applications to address privacy concerns. Consequently, traditional methods such as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) fail to distinguish encrypted traffic. To tackle this challenge, Artificial Intelligence (AI), in particular Machine Learning (ML), has emerged as a promising solution for encrypted traffic classification. A crucial prerequisite for any ML-based approach is traffic data cleaning, which removes flows that are not useful for training (e.g., irrelevant protocols, background activity, control-plane messages, and long-lived sessions). Existing cleaning solutions depend on manual inspection of every captured packet, making the process both costly and time-consuming. In this poster, we present an unsupervised framework that automatically cleans encrypted mobile traffic. Evaluation on real-world datasets shows that our framework incurs only a 2%~2.5% reduction in classification accuracy compared with manual cleaning. These results demonstrate that our method offers an efficient and effective preprocessing step for ML-based encrypted traffic classification.</description>

      <title>Why Pool When You Can Flow? Active Learning with GFlowNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scalability of pool-based active learning is limited by the computational cost of evaluating large unlabeled datasets, a challenge that is particularly acute in virtual screening for drug discovery. While active learning strategies such as Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) prioritize informative samples, it remains computationally intensive when scaled to libraries containing billions samples. In this work, we introduce BALD-GFlowNet, a generative active learning framework that circumvents this issue. Our method leverages Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to directly sample objects in proportion to the BALD reward. By replacing traditional pool-based acquisition with generative sampling, BALD-GFlowNet achieves scalability that is independent of the size of the unlabeled pool. In our virtual screening experiment, we show that BALD-GFlowNet achieves a performance comparable to that of standard BALD baseline while generating more structurally diverse molecules, offering a promising direction for efficient and scalable molecular discovery.</description>

      <title>Reward-Weighted Sampling: Enhancing Non-Autoregressive Characteristics in Masked Diffusion LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive alternative for large language modeling. Standard decoding methods for MDMs, such as confidence-based sampling, select tokens independently based on individual token confidences at each diffusion step. However, we observe that this independent token selection often results in generation orders resembling sequential autoregressive processes, limiting the advantages of non-autoregressive modeling. To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an external reward model to provide a principled global signal during the iterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS evaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token logits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global sequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of tokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more non-autoregressive generation order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical justification showing that reward-weighted logit scaling induces beneficial rank reversals in token selection and consistently improves expected reward. Experiments demonstrate that RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive generation orders, leading to improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating global signals in enhancing both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of MDMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) promises compact function approximators with access to vast Hilbert spaces, but its practical progress is slowed by NISQ-era constraints such as limited qubits and noise accumulation. We introduce a multi-chip ensemble framework using multiple small Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) to overcome these constraints. Our approach partitions complex, high-dimensional observations from the Super Mario Bros environment across independent quantum circuits, then classically aggregates their outputs within a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) framework. This modular architecture enables QRL in complex environments previously inaccessible to quantum agents, achieving superior performance and learning stability compared to classical baselines and single-chip quantum models. The multi-chip ensemble demonstrates enhanced scalability by reducing information loss from dimensionality reduction while remaining implementable on near-term quantum hardware, providing a practical pathway for applying QRL to real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Exam Readiness Index (ERI): A Theoretical Framework for a Composite, Explainable Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for an Exam Readiness Index (ERI): a composite, blueprint-aware score R in [0,100] that summarizes a learner's readiness for a high-stakes exam while remaining interpretable and actionable. The ERI aggregates six signals -- Mastery (M), Coverage (C), Retention (R), Pace (P), Volatility (V), and Endurance (E) -- each derived from a stream of practice and mock-test interactions. We formalize axioms for component maps and the composite, prove monotonicity, Lipschitz stability, and bounded drift under blueprint re-weighting, and show existence and uniqueness of the optimal linear composite under convex design constraints. We further characterize confidence bands via blueprint-weighted concentration and prove compatibility with prerequisite-admissible curricula (knowledge spaces / learning spaces). The paper focuses on theory; empirical study is left to future work.</description>

      <title>Task-Aware Adaptive Modulation: A Replay-Free and Resource-Efficient Approach For Continual Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual Graph Learning(CGL)focuses on acquiring new knowledge while retaining previously learned information, essential for real-world graph applications. Current methods grapple with two main issues:1) The Stability-Plasticity Dilemma: Replay-based methods often create an imbalance between the Dilemma, while incurring significant storage costs.2) The Resource-Heavy Pre-training: Leading replay-free methods critically depend on extensively pre-trained backbones, this reliance imposes a substantial resource burden.In this paper, we argue that the key to overcoming these challenges lies not in replaying data or fine-tuning the entire network, but in dynamically modulating the internal computational flow of a frozen backbone. We posit that lightweight, task-specific modules can effectively steer a GNN's reasoning process. Motivated by this insight, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive Modulation(TAAM), a replay-free, resource-efficient approach that charts a new path for navigating the stability-plasticity dilemma. TAAM's core is its Neural Synapse Modulators(NSM), which are trained and then frozen for each task to store expert knowledge. A pivotal prototype-guided strategy governs these modulators: 1) For training, it initializes a new NSM by deep-copying from a similar past modulator to boost knowledge transfer. 2) For inference, it selects the most relevant frozen NSM for each task. These NSMs insert into a frozen GNN backbone to perform fine-grained, node-attentive modulation of its internal flow-different from the static perturbations of prior methods. Extensive experiments show that TAAM comprehensively outperforms state-of-the-art methods across six GCIL benchmark datasets. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.</description>

      <title>Quantum Causality: Resolving Simpson's Paradox with $\mathcal{DO}$-Calculus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distinguishing correlation from causation is a fundamental challenge in machine intelligence, often representing a critical barrier to building robust and trustworthy systems. While Pearl's $\mathcal{DO}$-calculus provides a rigorous framework for causal inference, a parallel challenge lies in its physical implementation. Here, we apply and experimentally validate a quantum algorithmic framework for performing causal interventions. Our approach maps causal networks onto quantum circuits where probabilistic links are encoded by controlled-rotation gates, and interventions are realized by a structural remodeling of the circuit -- a physical analogue to Pearl's ``graph surgery''. We demonstrate the method's efficacy by resolving Simpson's Paradox in a 3-qubit model, and show its scalability by quantifying confounding bias in a 10-qubit healthcare simulation. Critically, we provide a proof-of-principle experimental validation on an IonQ Aria quantum computer, successfully reproducing the paradox and its resolution in the presence of real-world noise. This work establishes a practical pathway for quantum causal inference, offering a new computational tool to address deep-rooted challenges in algorithmic fairness and explainable AI (XAI).</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fairness in Skin Lesion Classification for Medical Diagnosis Using Prune Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Causal Interpretation of Sparse Autoencoder Features in Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.</description>

      <title>Low Power Approximate Multiplier Architecture for Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an low power approximate multiplier architecture for deep neural network (DNN) applications. A 4:2 compressor, introducing only a single combination error, is designed and integrated into an 8x8 unsigned multiplier. This integration significantly reduces the usage of exact compressors while preserving low error rates. The proposed multiplier is employed within a custom convolution layer and evaluated on neural network tasks, including image recognition and denoising. Hardware evaluation demonstrates that the proposed design achieves up to 30.24% energy savings compared to the best among existing multipliers. In image denoising, the custom approximate convolution layer achieves improved Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) compared to other approximate designs. Additionally, when applied to handwritten digit recognition, the model maintains high classification accuracy. These results demonstrate that the proposed architecture offers a favorable balance between energy efficiency and computational precision, making it suitable for low-power AI hardware implementations.</description>

      <title>LegalChainReasoner: A Legal Chain-guided Framework for Criminal Judicial Opinion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A criminal judicial opinion represents the judge's disposition of a case, including the decision rationale and sentencing. Automatically generating such opinions can assist in analyzing sentencing consistency and provide judges with references to similar past cases. However, current research typically approaches this task by dividing it into two isolated subtasks: legal reasoning and sentencing prediction. This separation often leads to inconsistency between the reasoning and predictions, failing to meet real-world judicial requirements. Furthermore, prior studies rely on manually curated knowledge to enhance applicability, yet such methods remain limited in practical deployment. To address these limitations and better align with legal practice, we propose a new LegalAI task: Judicial Opinion Generation, which simultaneously produces both legal reasoning and sentencing decisions. To achieve this, we introduce LegalChainReasoner, a framework that applies structured legal chains to guide the model through comprehensive case assessments. By integrating factual premises, composite legal conditions, and sentencing conclusions, our approach ensures flexible knowledge injection and end-to-end opinion generation. Experiments on two real-world and open-source Chinese legal case datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models.</description>

      <title>ProCause: Generating Counterfactual Outcomes to Evaluate Prescriptive Process Monitoring Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is the subfield of Process Mining that focuses on optimizing processes through real-time interventions based on event log data. Evaluating PresPM methods is challenging due to the lack of ground-truth outcomes for all intervention actions in datasets. A generative deep learning approach from the field of Causal Inference (CI), RealCause, has been commonly used to estimate the outcomes for proposed intervention actions to evaluate a new policy. However, RealCause overlooks the temporal dependencies in process data, and relies on a single CI model architecture, TARNet, limiting its effectiveness. To address both shortcomings, we introduce ProCause, a generative approach that supports both sequential (e.g., LSTMs) and non-sequential models while integrating multiple CI architectures (S-Learner, T-Learner, TARNet, and an ensemble). Our research using a simulator with known ground truths reveals that TARNet is not always the best choice; instead, an ensemble of models offers more consistent reliability, and leveraging LSTMs shows potential for improved evaluations when temporal dependencies are present. We further validate ProCause's practical effectiveness through a real-world data analysis, ensuring a more reliable evaluation of PresPM methods.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Iterative RAG for Knowledge Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.</description>

      <title>CaresAI at BioCreative IX Track 1 -- LLM for Biomedical QA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evident for accurate question answering across various domains. However, rigorous evaluation of their performance on complex question-answering (QA) capabilities is essential before deployment in real-world biomedical and healthcare applications. This paper presents our approach to the MedHopQA track of the BioCreative IX shared task, which focuses on multi-hop biomedical question answering involving diseases, genes, and chemicals. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning strategy leveraging LLaMA 3 8B, enhanced with a curated biomedical question-answer dataset compiled from external sources including BioASQ, MedQuAD, and TREC. Three experimental setups are explored: fine-tuning on combined short and long answers, short answers only, and long answers only. While our models demonstrate strong domain understanding, achieving concept-level accuracy scores of up to 0.8, their Exact Match (EM) scores remain significantly lower, particularly in the test phase. We introduce a two-stage inference pipeline for precise short-answer extraction to mitigate verbosity and improve alignment with evaluation metrics. Despite partial improvements, challenges persist in generating strictly formatted outputs. Our findings highlight the gap between semantic understanding and exact answer evaluation in biomedical LLM applications, motivating further research in output control and post-processing strategies.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Contrast Adjustment Module: A Clinically-Inspired Plug-and-Play Approach for Enhanced Fetal Plane Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters, transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories, the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under real-world image quality variations.</description>

      <title>AImoclips: A Benchmark for Evaluating Emotion Conveyance in Text-to-Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music (TTM) generation have enabled controllable and expressive music creation using natural language prompts. However, the emotional fidelity of TTM systems remains largely underexplored compared to human preference or text alignment. In this study, we introduce AImoclips, a benchmark for evaluating how well TTM systems convey intended emotions to human listeners, covering both open-source and commercial models. We selected 12 emotion intents spanning four quadrants of the valence-arousal space, and used six state-of-the-art TTM systems to generate over 1,000 music clips. A total of 111 participants rated the perceived valence and arousal of each clip on a 9-point Likert scale. Our results show that commercial systems tend to produce music perceived as more pleasant than intended, while open-source systems tend to perform the opposite. Emotions are more accurately conveyed under high-arousal conditions across all models. Additionally, all systems exhibit a bias toward emotional neutrality, highlighting a key limitation in affective controllability. This benchmark offers valuable insights into model-specific emotion rendering characteristics and supports future development of emotionally aligned TTM systems.</description>

      <title>Sequential Difference Maximization: Generating Adversarial Examples via Multi-Stage Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient adversarial attack methods are critical for assessing the robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we reconstruct the optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as "maximizing the difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels' probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is available at https://github.com/X-L-Liu/SDM.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Vehicle Speed Classification via BMCNN with Reinforcement Learning-Enhanced Acoustic Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic congestion remains a pressing urban challenge, requiring intelligent transportation systems for real-time management. We present a hybrid framework that combines deep learning and reinforcement learning for acoustic vehicle speed classification. A dual-branch BMCNN processes MFCC and wavelet features to capture complementary frequency patterns. An attention-enhanced DQN adaptively selects the minimal number of audio frames and triggers early decisions once confidence thresholds are reached. Evaluations on IDMT-Traffic and our SZUR-Acoustic (Suzhou) datasets show 95.99% and 92.3% accuracy, with up to 1.63x faster average processing via early termination. Compared with A3C, DDDQN, SA2C, PPO, and TD3, the method provides a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off and is suitable for real-time ITS deployment in heterogeneous urban environments.</description>

      <title>Look Beyond: Two-Stage Scene View Generation via Panorama and Video Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.</description>

      <title>Causal SHAP: Feature Attribution with Dependency Awareness through Causal Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) predictions has become crucial as ML models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. While SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is widely used for model interpretability, it fails to differentiate between causality and correlation, often misattributing feature importance when features are highly correlated. We propose Causal SHAP, a novel framework that integrates causal relationships into feature attribution while preserving many desirable properties of SHAP. By combining the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm for causal discovery and the Intervention Calculus when the DAG is Absent (IDA) algorithm for causal strength quantification, our approach addresses the weakness of SHAP. Specifically, Causal SHAP reduces attribution scores for features that are merely correlated with the target, as validated through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. This study contributes to the field of Explainable AI (XAI) by providing a practical framework for causal-aware model explanations. Our approach is particularly valuable in domains such as healthcare, where understanding true causal relationships is critical for informed decision-making.</description>

      <title>Why it is worth making an effort with GenAI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Students routinely use ChatGPT and the like now to help them with their homework, such as writing an essay. It takes less effort to complete and is easier to do than by hand. It can even produce as good if not better output than the student's own work. However, there is a growing concern that over-reliance on using GenAI in this way will stifle the development of learning writing and critical thinking skills. How might this trend be reversed? What if students were required to make more effort when using GenAI to do their homework? It might be more challenging, but the additional effort involved could result in them learning more and having a greater sense of achievement. This tension can be viewed as a form of effort paradox; where effort is both viewed as something to be avoided but at the same time is valued. Is it possible to let students learn sometimes with less and other times more effort? Students are already adept at the former but what about the latter? Could we design new kinds of AI tools that deliberately require more effort to use to deepen the learning experience? In this paper, I begin to outline what form these might take, for example, asking students to use a combination of GenAI tools with traditional learning approaches (e.g. note-taking while reading). I also discuss how else to design tools to think with that augments human cognition; where students learn more the skills of metacognition and reflection.</description>

      <title>Speech Command Recognition Using LogNNet Reservoir Computing for Embedded Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a low-resource speech-command recognizer combining energy-based voice activity detection (VAD), an optimized Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) pipeline, and the LogNNet reservoir-computing classifier. Using four commands from the Speech Commands da-taset downsampled to 8 kHz, we evaluate four MFCC aggregation schemes and find that adaptive binning (64-dimensional feature vector) offers the best accuracy-to-compactness trade-off. The LogNNet classifier with architecture 64:33:9:4 reaches 92.04% accuracy under speaker-independent evaluation, while requiring significantly fewer parameters than conventional deep learn-ing models. Hardware implementation on Arduino Nano 33 IoT (ARM Cor-tex-M0+, 48 MHz, 32 KB RAM) validates the practical feasibility, achieving ~90% real-time recognition accuracy while consuming only 18 KB RAM (55% utilization). The complete pipeline (VAD -&gt; MFCC -&gt; LogNNet) thus enables reliable on-device speech-command recognition under strict memory and compute limits, making it suitable for battery-powered IoT nodes, wire-less sensor networks, and hands-free control interfaces.</description>

      <title>Can General-Purpose Omnimodels Compete with Specialists? A Case Study in Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of powerful, general-purpose omnimodels capable of processing diverse data modalities has raised a critical question: can these ``jack-of-all-trades'' systems perform on par with highly specialized models in knowledge-intensive domains? This work investigates this question within the high-stakes field of medical image segmentation. We conduct a comparative study analyzing the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art omnimodel (Gemini 2.5 Pro, the ``Nano Banana'' model) against domain-specific deep learning models on three distinct tasks: polyp (endoscopy), retinal vessel (fundus), and breast tumor segmentation (ultrasound). Our study focuses on performance at the extremes by curating subsets of the ``easiest'' and ``hardest'' cases based on the specialist models' accuracy. Our findings reveal a nuanced and task-dependent landscape. For polyp and breast tumor segmentation, specialist models excel on easy samples, but the omnimodel demonstrates greater robustness on hard samples where specialists fail catastrophically. Conversely, for the fine-grained task of retinal vessel segmentation, the specialist model maintains superior performance across both easy and hard cases. Intriguingly, qualitative analysis suggests omnimodels may possess higher sensitivity, identifying subtle anatomical features missed by human annotators. Our results indicate that while current omnimodels are not yet a universal replacement for specialists, their unique strengths suggest a potential complementary role with specialist models, particularly in enhancing robustness on challenging edge cases.</description>

      <title>Pose as Clinical Prior: Learning Dual Representations for Scoliosis Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050 adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA) module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance. Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://zhouzi180.github.io/Scoliosis1K/.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Latency-Critical Applications with AI-Powered Semi-Automatic Fine-Grained Parallelization on SMT Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latency-critical applications tend to show low utilization of functional units due to frequent cache misses and mispredictions during speculative execution in high-performance superscalar processors. However, due to significant impact on single-thread performance, Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) technology is rarely used with heavy threads of latency-critical applications. In this paper, we explore utilization of SMT technology to support fine-grained parallelization of latency-critical applications. Following the advancements in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce Aira, an AI-powered Parallelization Adviser. To implement Aira, we extend AI Coding Agent in Cursor IDE with additional tools connected through Model Context Protocol, enabling end-to-end AI Agent for parallelization. Additional connected tools enable LLM-guided hotspot detection, collection of dynamic dependencies with Dynamic Binary Instrumentation, SMT-aware performance simulation to estimate performance gains. We apply Aira with Relic parallel framework for fine-grained task parallelism on SMT cores to parallelize latency-critical benchmarks representing real-world applications used in industry. We show 17% geomean performance gain from parallelization of latency-critical benchmarks using Aira with Relic framework.</description>

      <title>An Explainable Gaussian Process Auto-encoder for Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable machine learning has attracted much interest in the community where the stakes are high. Counterfactual explanations methods have become an important tool in explaining a black-box model. The recent advances have leveraged the power of generative models such as an autoencoder. In this paper, we propose a novel method using a Gaussian process to construct the auto-encoder architecture for generating counterfactual samples. The resulting model requires fewer learnable parameters and thus is less prone to overfitting. We also introduce a novel density estimator that allows for searching for in-distribution samples. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm for selecting the optimal regularization rate on density estimator while searching for counterfactuals. We experiment with our method in several large-scale tabular datasets and compare with other auto-encoder-based methods. The results show that our method is capable of generating diversified and in-distribution counterfactual samples.</description>

      <title>Spotlighter: Revisiting Prompt Tuning from a Representative Mining View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals, we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to 0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for our method will be available at https://github.com/greatest-gourmet/Spotlighter.</description>

      <title>TinyMusician: On-Device Music Generation with Knowledge Distillation and Mixed Precision Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of the generative model has gained unprecedented attention in the music generation area. Transformer-based architectures have set new benchmarks for model performance. However, their practical adoption is hindered by some critical challenges: the demand for massive computational resources and inference time, due to their large number of parameters. These obstacles make them infeasible to deploy on edge devices, such as smartphones and wearables, with limited computational resources. In this work, we present TinyMusician, a lightweight music generation model distilled from MusicGen (a State-of-the-art music generation model). TinyMusician integrates two innovations: (i) Stage-mixed Bidirectional and Skewed KL-Divergence and (ii) Adaptive Mixed-Precision Quantization. The experimental results demonstrate that TinyMusician retains 93% of the MusicGen-Small performance with 55% less model size. TinyMusician is the first mobile-deployable music generation model that eliminates cloud dependency while maintaining high audio fidelity and efficient resource usage</description>

      <title>Superposition in Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpreting graph neural networks (GNNs) is difficult because message passing mixes signals and internal channels rarely align with human concepts. We study superposition, the sharing of directions by multiple features, directly in the latent space of GNNs. Using controlled experiments with unambiguous graph concepts, we extract features as (i) class-conditional centroids at the graph level and (ii) linear-probe directions at the node level, and then analyze their geometry with simple basis-invariant diagnostics. Across GCN/GIN/GAT we find: increasing width produces a phase pattern in overlap; topology imprints overlap onto node-level features that pooling partially remixes into task-aligned graph axes; sharper pooling increases axis alignment and reduces channel sharing; and shallow models can settle into metastable low-rank embeddings. These results connect representational geometry with concrete design choices (width, pooling, and final-layer activations) and suggest practical approaches for more interpretable GNNs.</description>

      <title>MedCOD: Enhancing English-to-Spanish Medical Translation of Large Language Models Using Enriched Chain-of-Dictionary Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MedCOD (Medical Chain-of-Dictionary), a hybrid framework designed to improve English-to-Spanish medical translation by integrating domain-specific structured knowledge into large language models (LLMs). MedCOD integrates domain-specific knowledge from both the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and the LLM-as-Knowledge-Base (LLM-KB) paradigm to enhance structured prompting and fine-tuning. We constructed a parallel corpus of 2,999 English-Spanish MedlinePlus articles and a 100-sentence test set annotated with structured medical contexts. Four open-source LLMs (Phi-4, Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-7B, and LLaMA-3.1-8B) were evaluated using structured prompts that incorporated multilingual variants, medical synonyms, and UMLS-derived definitions, combined with LoRA-based fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that MedCOD significantly improves translation quality across all models. For example, Phi-4 with MedCOD and fine-tuning achieved BLEU 44.23, chrF++ 28.91, and COMET 0.863, surpassing strong baseline models like GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini. Ablation studies confirm that both MedCOD prompting and model adaptation independently contribute to performance gains, with their combination yielding the highest improvements. These findings highlight the potential of structured knowledge integration to enhance LLMs for medical translation tasks.</description>

      <title>SCOUT: Toward Sub-Quadratic Attention via Segment Compression for Optimized Utility in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of sequence modeling tasks, but their quadratic attention complexity limits scalability to long sequences. Linear models such as Mamba and sliding-window attention (SWA) address this by mixing tokens through recurrent or localized operations with fixed-size memory, achieving efficient inference. However, these methods risk degrading performance on long sequences due to their inability to retain detailed information from distant tokens. We propose SCOUT (Segment Compression for Optimized Utility in Transformers), a hybrid architecture that compresses tokens locally within fixed-size segments and applies attention only over these compressed representations. Each token embedding is first enriched via a linear local mixer, Mamba or SWA, that integrates recent context. Then, instead of attending to all previous tokens, each token sparsely attends to a small number of compressed checkpoint tokens that summarize the input history. This design retains much of the expressivity of full attention while substantially reducing the computational and memory cost. By attending to compressed history rather than all previous tokens, SCOUT incurs slightly higher memory than purely linear models, but its growth rate remains sub-quadratic and far more scalable than that of full Transformers. We analyze SCOUT's computational and memory efficiency and evaluate it empirically on long-context language modeling and reasoning tasks. SCOUT with both Mamba and SWA mixers outperforms strong long-sequence baselines under the same computational budget, matches full-attention Transformers on language modeling and common-sense reasoning tasks at 400M and 1.3B scales. Moreover, our SCOUT achieves higher end-to-end throughput than SOTA models, while delivering comparable results on long sequence benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Structure and Destructure: Dual Forces in the Making of Knowledge Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The making of knowledge engines in natural language processing has been shaped by two seemingly distinct paradigms: one grounded in structure, the other driven by massively available unstructured data. The structured paradigm leverages predefined symbolic interactions, such as knowledge graphs, as priors and designs models to capture them. In contrast, the unstructured paradigm centers on scaling transformer architectures with increasingly vast data and model sizes, as seen in modern large language models. Despite their divergence, this thesis seeks to establish conceptual connections bridging these paradigms. Two complementary forces, structure and destructure, emerge across both paradigms: structure organizes seen symbolic interactions, while destructure, through periodic embedding resets, improves model plasticity and generalization to unseen scenarios. These connections form a new recipe for developing general knowledge engines that can support transparent, controllable, and adaptable intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>ART: Adaptive Resampling-based Training for Imbalanced Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional resampling methods for handling class imbalance typically uses fixed distributions, undersampling the majority or oversampling the minority. These static strategies ignore changes in class-wise learning difficulty, which can limit the overall performance of the model.
  This paper proposes an Adaptive Resampling-based Training (ART) method that periodically updates the distribution of the training data based on the class-wise performance of the model. Specifically, ART uses class-wise macro F1 scores, computed at fixed intervals, to determine the degree of resampling to be performed.
  Unlike instance-level difficulty modeling, which is noisy and outlier-sensitive, ART adapts at the class level. This allows the model to incrementally shift its attention towards underperforming classes in a way that better aligns with the optimization objective.
  Results on diverse benchmarks, including Pima Indians Diabetes and Yeast dataset demonstrate that ART consistently outperforms both resampling-based and algorithm-level methods, including Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), NearMiss Undersampling, and Cost-sensitive Learning on binary as well as multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of imbalance.
  In most settings, these improvements are statistically significant. On tabular datasets, gains are significant under paired t-tests and Wilcoxon tests (p &lt; 0.05), while results on text and image tasks remain favorable. Compared to training on the original imbalanced data, ART improves macro F1 by an average of 2.64 percentage points across all tested tabular datasets. Unlike existing methods, whose performance varies by task, ART consistently delivers the strongest macro F1, making it a reliable choice for imbalanced classification.</description>

      <title>Who Gets Left Behind? Auditing Disability Inclusivity in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for accessibility guidance, yet many disability groups remain underserved by their advice. To address this gap, we present taxonomy aligned benchmark1 of human validated, general purpose accessibility questions, designed to systematically audit inclusivity across disabilities. Our benchmark evaluates models along three dimensions: Question-Level Coverage (breadth within answers), Disability-Level Coverage (balance across nine disability categories), and Depth (specificity of support). Applying this framework to 17 proprietary and open-weight models reveals persistent inclusivity gaps: Vision, Hearing, and Mobility are frequently addressed, while Speech, Genetic/Developmental, Sensory-Cognitive, and Mental Health remain under served. Depth is similarly concentrated in a few categories but sparse elsewhere. These findings reveal who gets left behind in current LLM accessibility guidance and highlight actionable levers: taxonomy-aware prompting/training and evaluations that jointly audit breadth, balance, and depth.</description>

      <title>Clone What You Can't Steal: Black-Box LLM Replication via Logit Leakage and Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in mission-critical systems, facilitating tasks such as satellite operations, command-and-control, military decision support, and cyber defense. Many of these systems are accessed through application programming interfaces (APIs). When such APIs lack robust access controls, they can expose full or top-k logits, creating a significant and often overlooked attack surface. Prior art has mainly focused on reconstructing the output projection layer or distilling surface-level behaviors. However, regenerating a black-box model under tight query constraints remains underexplored. We address that gap by introducing a constrained replication pipeline that transforms partial logit leakage into a functional deployable substitute model clone. Our two-stage approach (i) reconstructs the output projection matrix by collecting top-k logits from under 10k black-box queries via singular value decomposition (SVD) over the logits, then (ii) distills the remaining architecture into compact student models with varying transformer depths, trained on an open source dataset. A 6-layer student recreates 97.6% of the 6-layer teacher model's hidden-state geometry, with only a 7.31% perplexity increase, and a 7.58 Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL). A 4-layer variant achieves 17.1% faster inference and 18.1% parameter reduction with comparable performance. The entire attack completes in under 24 graphics processing unit (GPU) hours and avoids triggering API rate-limit defenses. These results demonstrate how quickly a cost-limited adversary can clone an LLM, underscoring the urgent need for hardened inference APIs and secure on-premise defense deployments.</description>

      <title>Online Decentralized Federated Multi-task Learning With Trustworthiness in Cyber-Physical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-task learning is an effective way to address the challenge of model personalization caused by high data heterogeneity in federated learning. However, extending multi-task learning to the online decentralized federated learning setting is yet to be explored. The online decentralized federated learning setting considers many real-world applications of federated learning, such as autonomous systems, where clients communicate peer-to-peer and the data distribution of each client is time-varying. A more serious problem in real-world applications of federated learning is the presence of Byzantine clients. Byzantine-resilient approaches used in federated learning work only when the number of Byzantine clients is less than one-half the total number of clients. Yet, it is difficult to put a limit on the number of Byzantine clients within a system in reality. However, recent work in robotics shows that it is possible to exploit cyber-physical properties of a system to predict clients' behavior and assign a trust probability to received signals. This can help to achieve resiliency in the presence of a dominating number of Byzantine clients. Therefore, in this paper, we develop an online decentralized federated multi-task learning algorithm to provide model personalization and resiliency when the number of Byzantine clients dominates the number of honest clients. Our proposed algorithm leverages cyber-physical properties, such as the received signal strength in wireless systems or side information, to assign a trust probability to local models received from neighbors in each iteration. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs close to a Byzantine-free setting.</description>

      <title>MEPT: Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning as a Manifold Mapper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering deep neural networks as manifold mappers, the pretrain-then-fine-tune paradigm can be interpreted as a two-stage process: pretrain establishes a broad knowledge base, and fine-tune adjusts the model parameters to activate specific neural pathways to align with the target manifold. Although prior fine-tuning approaches demonstrate success, their rigid parameter space limits their ability to dynamically activate appropriate neural pathways, rendering them ill-equipped to adapt flexibly to the diverse and evolving data distributions. In light of this view, we propose a novel approach, Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), as an effective and efficient manifold-mapping framework. MEPT leverages the Mixture of Experts architecture by integrating multiple prompt experts to adaptively learn diverse and non-stationary data distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MEPT outperforms several state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on SuperGLUE, achieving notable improvements in mean accuracy (e.g., 1.94%) while significantly reducing activated prompts by 79.25%. The effectiveness of MEPT is further supported by theoretical insights from manifold learning and validated through neural activation pathway visualization results. Our code is avaliable at https://github.com/runtsang/MEPT.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Driven Generalizable Feature Representation for Cross-User Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors is crucial for healthcare, fitness tracking, and smart environments, yet cross-user variability -- stemming from diverse motion patterns, sensor placements, and physiological traits -- hampers generalization in real-world settings. Conventional supervised learning methods often overfit to user-specific patterns, leading to poor performance on unseen users. Existing domain generalization approaches, while promising, frequently overlook temporal dependencies or depend on impractical domain-specific labels. We propose Temporal-Preserving Reinforcement Learning Domain Generalization (TPRL-DG), a novel framework that redefines feature extraction as a sequential decision-making process driven by reinforcement learning. TPRL-DG leverages a Transformer-based autoregressive generator to produce temporal tokens that capture user-invariant activity dynamics, optimized via a multi-objective reward function balancing class discrimination and cross-user invariance. Key innovations include: (1) an RL-driven approach for domain generalization, (2) autoregressive tokenization to preserve temporal coherence, and (3) a label-free reward design eliminating the need for target user annotations. Evaluations on the DSADS and PAMAP2 datasets show that TPRL-DG surpasses state-of-the-art methods in cross-user generalization, achieving superior accuracy without per-user calibration. By learning robust, user-invariant temporal patterns, TPRL-DG enables scalable HAR systems, facilitating advancements in personalized healthcare, adaptive fitness tracking, and context-aware environments.</description>

      <title>Seeing through Unclear Glass: Occlusion Removal with One Shot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered to the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the incoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing deep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses relied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean image pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of rain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants. More importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of different types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It involves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model for the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images, especially the unseen ones.</description>

      <title>Q-Learning--Driven Adaptive Rewiring for Cooperative Control in Heterogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperation emergence in multi-agent systems represents a fundamental statistical physics problem where microscopic learning rules drive macroscopic collective behavior transitions. We propose a Q-learning-based variant of adaptive rewiring that builds on mechanisms studied in the literature. This method combines temporal difference learning with network restructuring so that agents can optimize strategies and social connections based on interaction histories. Through neighbor-specific Q-learning, agents develop sophisticated partnership management strategies that enable cooperator cluster formation, creating spatial separation between cooperative and defective regions. Using power-law networks that reflect real-world heterogeneous connectivity patterns, we evaluate emergent behaviors under varying rewiring constraint levels, revealing distinct cooperation patterns across parameter space rather than sharp thermodynamic transitions. Our systematic analysis identifies three behavioral regimes: a permissive regime (low constraints) enabling rapid cooperative cluster formation, an intermediate regime with sensitive dependence on dilemma strength, and a patient regime (high constraints) where strategic accumulation gradually optimizes network structure. Simulation results show that while moderate constraints create transition-like zones that suppress cooperation, fully adaptive rewiring enhances cooperation levels through systematic exploration of favorable network configurations. Quantitative analysis reveals that increased rewiring frequency drives large-scale cluster formation with power-law size distributions. Our results establish a new paradigm for understanding intelligence-driven cooperation pattern formation in complex adaptive systems, revealing how machine learning serves as an alternative driving force for spontaneous organization in multi-agent networks.</description>

      <title>DRetNet: A Novel Deep Learning Framework for Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, necessitating early detection to prevent vision loss. Current automated DR detection systems often struggle with poor-quality images, lack interpretability, and insufficient integration of domain-specific knowledge. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that integrates three innovative contributions: (1) Adaptive Retinal Image Enhancement Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs): this technique dynamically enhances retinal images by incorporating physical constraints, improving the visibility of critical features such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and exudates; (2) Hybrid Feature Fusion Network (HFFN): by combining deep learning embeddings with handcrafted features, HFFN leverages both learned representations and domain-specific knowledge to enhance generalization and accuracy; (3) Multi-Stage Classifier with Uncertainty Quantification: this method breaks down the classification process into logical stages, providing interpretable predictions and confidence scores, thereby improving clinical trust. The proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 92.7%, a precision of 92.5%, a recall of 92.6%, an F1-score of 92.5%, an AUC of 97.8%, a mAP of 0.96, and an MCC of 0.85. Ophthalmologists rated the framework's predictions as highly clinically relevant (4.8/5), highlighting its alignment with real-world diagnostic needs. Qualitative analyses, including Grad-CAM visualizations and uncertainty heatmaps, further enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness of the system. The framework demonstrates robust performance across diverse conditions, including low-quality images, noisy data, and unseen datasets. These features make the proposed framework a promising tool for clinical adoption, enabling more accurate and reliable DR detection in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>Assessing Large Language Models on Islamic Legal Reasoning: Evidence from Inheritance Law Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models in Islamic inheritance law, known as 'ilm al-mawarith. We assess the performance of seven LLMs using a benchmark of 1,000 multiple-choice questions covering diverse inheritance scenarios, designed to test models' ability to understand the inheritance context and compute the distribution of shares prescribed by Islamic jurisprudence. The results reveal a significant performance gap: o3 and Gemini 2.5 achieved accuracies above 90%, whereas ALLaM, Fanar, LLaMA, and Mistral scored below 50%. These disparities reflect important differences in reasoning ability and domain adaptation. We conduct a detailed error analysis to identify recurring failure patterns across models, including misunderstandings of inheritance scenarios, incorrect application of legal rules, and insufficient domain knowledge. Our findings highlight limitations in handling structured legal reasoning and suggest directions for improving performance in Islamic legal reasoning.

      <title>DSDE: Dynamic Speculative Decoding with KLD Stability for Real-World Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model inference, but its reliance on a fixed speculation length is suboptimal in large-batch serving environments with diverse requests. This paper explores a new direction for dynamic adaptation by investigating a novel class of post-hoc, diagnostic signals. We propose Dynamic Speculative Decoding Engine (DSDE), a training-free framework built on two primary components: (1) a predictive signal based on the variance of the Kullback-Leibler (KLD) divergence, which diagnoses the generation's regional stability, and (2) an adaptive speculation length cap to mitigate the straggler problem in per-sequence decoding. Experiments demonstrate the potential of using KLD-based stability signals for dynamic adaptation. An algorithm guided by these signals achieves end-to-end latency competitive with leading baselines and exhibits superior robustness across diverse workloads. This robustness is particularly valuable in challenging low-acceptance-rate regimes, where the proposed signal maintains its diagnostic utility. Collectively, these findings validate post-hoc signals as a valuable component for building more robust and intelligent LLM inference systems, and highlight a promising direction for future research on dynamic speculation length adaptation.</description>

      <title>REFRAG: Rethinking RAG based Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.</description>

      <title>Natural Context Drift Undermines the Natural Language Understanding of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How does the natural evolution of context paragraphs affect question answering in generative Large Language Models (LLMs)? To investigate this, we propose a framework for curating naturally evolved, human-edited variants of reading passages from contemporary QA benchmarks and for analyzing LLM performance across a range of semantic similarity scores, which quantify how closely each variant aligns with content seen during pretraining. Using this framework, we evaluate six QA datasets and eight LLMs with publicly available training data. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance declines as reading passages naturally diverge from the versions encountered during pretraining-even when the question and all necessary information remains present at inference time. For instance, average model accuracy on BoolQ drops by over 30% from the highest to lowest similarity bins, with slopes exceeding 70 across several LLMs. These findings suggest that natural text evolution poses a significant challenge to the language understanding capabilities of LLMs.</description>

      <title>CCE: Confidence-Consistency Evaluation for Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time Series Anomaly Detection metrics serve as crucial tools for model evaluation. However, existing metrics suffer from several limitations: insufficient discriminative power, strong hyperparameter dependency, sensitivity to perturbations, and high computational overhead. This paper introduces Confidence-Consistency Evaluation (CCE), a novel evaluation metric that simultaneously measures prediction confidence and uncertainty consistency. By employing Bayesian estimation to quantify the uncertainty of anomaly scores, we construct both global and event-level confidence and consistency scores for model predictions, resulting in a concise CCE metric. Theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate that CCE possesses strict boundedness, Lipschitz robustness against score perturbations, and linear time complexity $\mathcal{O}(n)$. Furthermore, we establish RankEval, a benchmark for comparing the ranking capabilities of various metrics. RankEval represents the first standardized and reproducible evaluation pipeline that enables objective comparison of evaluation metrics. Both CCE and RankEval implementations are fully open-source.</description>

Abstract: We present NoLBERT, a lightweight, timestamped foundational language model for empirical research in social sciences, particularly in economics and finance. By pre-training exclusively on 1976-1995 text, NoLBERT avoids both lookback and lookahead biases that can undermine econometric inference. It exceeds domain-specific baselines on NLP benchmarks while maintaining temporal consistency. Applied to patent texts, NoLBERT enables the construction of firm-level innovation networks and shows that gains in innovation centrality predict higher long-run profit growth.</description>

      <title>SC-GIR: Goal-oriented Semantic Communication via Invariant Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Goal-oriented semantic communication (SC) aims to revolutionize communication systems by transmitting only task-essential information. However, current approaches face challenges such as joint training at transceivers, leading to redundant data exchange and reliance on labeled datasets, which limits their task-agnostic utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Goal-oriented Invariant Representation-based SC (SC-GIR) for image transmission. Our framework leverages self-supervised learning to extract an invariant representation that encapsulates crucial information from the source data, independent of the specific downstream task. This compressed representation facilitates efficient communication while retaining key features for successful downstream task execution. Focusing on machine-to-machine tasks, we utilize covariance-based contrastive learning techniques to obtain a latent representation that is both meaningful and semantically dense. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on downstream tasks, we apply it to various image datasets for lossy compression. The compressed representations are then used in a goal-oriented AI task. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that SC-GIR outperforms baseline schemes by nearly 10%,, and achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data under different SNR conditions. These results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning compact and informative latent representations.</description>

      <title>MATL-DC: A Multi-domain Aggregation Transfer Learning Framework for EEG Emotion Recognition with Domain-Class Prototype under Unseen Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals is increasingly becoming a key research hotspot in affective Brain-Computer Interfaces (aBCIs). However, the current transfer learning model greatly depends on the source domain and target domain data, which hinder the practical application of emotion recognition. Therefore, we propose a Multi-domain Aggregation Transfer Learning framework for EEG emotion recognition with Domain-Class prototype under unseen targets (MATL-DC). We design the feature decoupling module to decouple class-invariant domain features from domain-invariant class features from shallow features. In the model training stage, the multi-domain aggregation mechanism aggregates the domain feature space to form a superdomain, which enhances the characteristics of emotional EEG signals. In each superdomain, we further extract the class prototype representation by class features. In addition, we adopt the pairwise learning strategy to transform the sample classification problem into the similarity problem between sample pairs, which effectively alleviates the influence of label noise. It is worth noting that the target domain is completely unseen during the training process. In the inference stage, we use the trained domain-class prototypes for inference, and then realize emotion recognition. We rigorously validate it on the publicly available databases (SEED, SEED-IV and SEED-V). The results show that the accuracy of MATL-DC model is 84.70\%, 68.11\% and 61.08\%, respectively. MATL-DC achieves comparable or even better performance than methods that rely on both source and target domains. The source code is available at https://github.com/WuCB-BCI/MATL-DC.</description>

      <title>EZhouNet:A framework based on graph neural network and anchor interval for the respiratory sound event detection</title>

Abstract: Auscultation is a key method for early diagnosis of respiratory and pulmonary diseases, relying on skilled healthcare professionals. However, the process is often subjective, with variability between experts. As a result, numerous deep learning-based automatic classification methods have emerged, most of which focus on respiratory sound classification. In contrast, research on respiratory sound event detection remains limited. Existing sound event detection methods typically rely on frame-level predictions followed by post-processing to generate event-level outputs, making interval boundaries challenging to learn directly. Furthermore, many approaches can only handle fixed-length audio, lim- iting their applicability to variable-length respiratory sounds. Additionally, the impact of respiratory sound location information on detection performance has not been extensively explored. To address these issues, we propose a graph neural network-based framework with anchor intervals, capable of handling variable-length audio and providing more precise temporal localization for abnormal respi- ratory sound events. Our method improves both the flexibility and applicability of respiratory sound detection. Experiments on the SPRSound 2024 and HF Lung V1 datasets demonstrate the effec- tiveness of the proposed approach, and incorporating respiratory position information enhances the discrimination between abnormal sounds.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Large Language Model for Knowledge Graph Completion via Structure-Aware Alignment-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer new knowledge and make predictions from knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities. LLM-enhanced KGC methods primarily focus on designing task-specific instructions, achieving promising advancements. However, there are still two critical challenges. First, existing methods often ignore the inconsistent representation spaces between natural language and graph structures. Second, most approaches design separate instructions for different KGC tasks, leading to duplicate works and time-consuming processes. To address these challenges, we propose SAT, a novel framework that enhances LLMs for KGC via structure-aware alignment-tuning. Specifically, we first introduce hierarchical knowledge alignment to align graph embeddings with the natural language space through multi-task contrastive learning. Then, we propose structural instruction tuning to guide LLMs in performing structure-aware reasoning over KGs, using a unified graph instruction combined with a lightweight knowledge adapter. Experimental results on two KGC tasks across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in the link prediction task with improvements ranging from 8.7% to 29.8%.</description>

      <title>DynaMind: Reconstructing Dynamic Visual Scenes from EEG by Aligning Temporal Dynamics and Multimodal Semantics to Guided Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper (RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal consistency between the feature representations and the original neural recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by 12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual semantics.</description>

      <title>FocusDPO: Dynamic Preference Optimization for Multi-Subject Personalized Image Generation via Adaptive Focus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-subject personalized image generation aims to synthesize customized images containing multiple specified subjects without requiring test-time optimization. However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of controllable multi-subject image synthesis.</description>

      <title>Modular Techniques for Synthetic Long-Context Data Generation in Language Model Training and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to process and reason over long textual inputs is critical for a wide range of real-world applications. However, progress in this area is significantly constrained by the absence of high-quality, diverse, and verifiable long-context datasets suitable for both training and evaluation. This work introduces a modular, extensible framework for synthetic long-context data generation via prompt-based interaction with LLMs. The framework supports multiple training and alignment objectives, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). It encompasses four core generation paradigms: multi-turn conversational dialogues, document-grounded input-output pairs, verifiable instruction-response tasks, and long-context reasoning examples. Through templated prompting, a model-agnostic architecture, and metadata-enriched outputs, the proposed approach facilitates scalable, controllable, and purpose-aligned dataset creation for advancing long-context capabilities in LLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI systems are increasingly governed by natural language principles, yet a key challenge arising from reliance on language remains underexplored: interpretive ambiguity. As in legal systems, ambiguity arises both from how these principles are written and how they are applied. But while legal systems use institutional safeguards to manage such ambiguity, such as transparent appellate review policing interpretive constraints, AI alignment pipelines offer no comparable protections. Different interpretations of the same rule can lead to inconsistent or unstable model behavior. Drawing on legal theory, we identify key gaps in current alignment pipelines by examining how legal systems constrain ambiguity at both the rule creation and rule application steps. We then propose a computational framework that mirrors two legal mechanisms: (1) a rule refinement pipeline that minimizes interpretive disagreement by revising ambiguous rules (analogous to agency rulemaking or iterative legislative action), and (2) prompt-based interpretive constraints that reduce inconsistency in rule application (analogous to legal canons that guide judicial discretion). We evaluate our framework on a 5,000-scenario subset of the WildChat dataset and show that both interventions significantly improve judgment consistency across a panel of reasonable interpreters. Our approach offers a first step toward systematically managing interpretive ambiguity, an essential step for building more robust, law-following AI systems.</description>

      <title>Preserving Vector Space Properties in Dimensionality Reduction: A Relationship Preserving Loss Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction can distort vector space properties such as orthogonality and linear independence, which are critical for tasks including cross-modal retrieval, clustering, and classification. We propose a Relationship Preserving Loss (RPL), a loss function that preserves these properties by minimizing discrepancies between relationship matrices (e.g., Gram or cosine) of high-dimensional data and their low-dimensional embeddings. RPL trains neural networks for non-linear projections and is supported by error bounds derived from matrix perturbation theory. Initial experiments suggest that RPL reduces embedding dimensions while largely retaining performance on downstream tasks, likely due to its preservation of key vector space properties. While we describe here the use of RPL in dimensionality reduction, this loss can also be applied more broadly, for example to cross-domain alignment and transfer learning, knowledge distillation, fairness and invariance, dehubbing, graph and manifold learning, and federated learning, where distributed embeddings must remain geometrically consistent.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation with Mixture of Low-Rank Experts for Diverse Endoscopic Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost and efficient three-dimensional scene perception in endoscopy. The variety of illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenge for generalizable depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in various endoscopy. Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference, from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and reflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on diverse endoscopic scenes. The proposed method could contribute to accurate endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The code will be released upon acceptance, while the demo video can be found on here: https://endo-gede.netlify.app/.</description>

      <title>Web Fraud Attacks Against LLM-Driven Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the proliferation of applications built upon LLM-driven multi-agent systems (MAS), the security of Web links has become a critical concern in ensuring system reliability. Once an agent is induced to visit a malicious website, attackers can use it as a springboard to conduct diverse subsequent attacks, which will drastically expand the attack surface. In this paper, we propose Web Fraud Attacks, a novel type of attack aiming at inducing MAS to visit malicious websites. We design 11 representative attack variants that encompass domain name tampering (homoglyph deception, character substitution, etc.), link structure camouflage (sub-directory nesting, sub-domain grafting, parameter obfuscation, etc.), and other deceptive techniques tailored to exploit MAS's vulnerabilities in link validation. Through extensive experiments on these crafted attack vectors, we demonstrate that Web fraud attacks not only exhibit significant destructive potential across different MAS architectures but also possess a distinct advantage in evasion: they circumvent the need for complex input formats such as jailbreaking, which inherently carry higher exposure risks. These results underscore the importance of addressing Web fraud attacks in LLM-driven MAS, as their stealthiness and destructiveness pose non-negligible threats to system security and user safety.</description>

      <title>DaMoC: Efficiently Selecting the Optimal Large Language Model for Fine-tuning Domain Taks Based on Data and Model Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle with domain-specific ones, requiring fine-tuning with specific data. With many open-source LLMs available, selecting the best model for fine-tuning downstream tasks is challenging, primarily focusing on how to quickly identify the optimal LLM. We introduce a Data and Model Compression Framework (DaMoC) that addresses this challenge by: 1) Data Level: A systematic categorization of data filtering methodologies for LLMs is first established, classifying them into three distinct paradigms: (1) distribution-aware methods, (2) quality-aware methods, and (3) hybrid approaches considering both dimensions. Further, we enhance the density of key tokens in the text achieving token compression. Subsequently, we use an LLM to iterative rewrite the text to optimize its expression. 2) Model Level: We use layer similarity scores to assess each layer's importance and remove those with lower importance. Then, we introduce a sparse merging paradigm to preserve as much of the original model's capability as possible. Extensive experiments on four datasets, medical Q&amp;A, financial Q&amp;A, general Q&amp;A, and reading comprehension, show that we can select the optimal LLM while saving approximately 20-fold in training time.</description>

      <title>LiquidGEMM: Hardware-Efficient W4A8 GEMM Kernel for High-Performance LLM Serving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantization is a critical technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing memory footprint and improving computational efficiency. Among various schemes, 4-bit weight and 8-bit activation quantization (W4A8) offers a strong balance between accuracy and performance. However, existing W4A8 GEMM kernels fall short in practice due to inefficient dequantization on CUDA Cores, which cannot keep pace with the high throughput of Tensor Cores. In this paper, we present LiquidGEMM, a hardware-efficient W4A8 GEMM kernel for efficient LLM serving. LiquidGEMM designs two key techniques: LiquidQuant, a hardware-efficient quantization method that enables fast, overflow-safe dequantization using just two arithmetic instructions per four elements; and an implicit fine-grained pipeline that fully overlaps weight loading, dequantization, and MMA across warp groups without software synchronization or redundant memory traffic. Experimental results show that LiquidGEMM achieves up to 2.90x speedup over state-of-the-art W4A8 kernels and up to 4.94x end-to-end system-level speedup. Compared to various quantized GEMM kernels in NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM, LiquidGEMM delivers 1.12-1.63x performance gains, and achieves up to 1.63x system-level speedup.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the Chain-of-Thought: The Roles of In-Context Learning and Pre-trained Priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing model inference capabilities. Despite growing interest in Chain-of-Thought reasoning, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This paper explores the working mechanisms of Chain-of-Thought reasoning from the perspective of the dual relationship between in-context learning and pretrained priors. We first conduct a fine-grained lexical-level analysis of rationales to examine the model's reasoning behavior. Then, by incrementally introducing noisy exemplars, we examine how the model balances pretrained priors against erroneous in-context information. Finally, we investigate whether prompt engineering can induce slow thinking in large language models. Our extensive experiments reveal three key findings: (1) The model not only quickly learns the reasoning structure at the lexical level but also grasps deeper logical reasoning patterns, yet it heavily relies on pretrained priors. (2) Providing sufficient exemplars shifts the model's decision-making from pretrained priors to in-context signals, while misleading prompts introduce instability. (3) Long Chain-of-Thought prompting can induce the model to generate longer reasoning chains, thereby improving its performance on downstream tasks.</description>

Abstract: Object detection architectures are notoriously difficult to understand, often more so than large language models. While RT-DETRv2 represents an important advance in real-time detection, most existing diagrams do little to clarify how its components actually work and fit together. In this article, we explain the architecture of RT-DETRv2 through a series of eight carefully designed illustrations, moving from the overall pipeline down to critical components such as the encoder, decoder, and multi-scale deformable attention. Our goal is to make the existing one genuinely understandable. By visualizing the flow of tensors and unpacking the logic behind each module, we hope to provide researchers and practitioners with a clearer mental model of how RT-DETRv2 works under the hood.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Task Offloading in Wireless Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In edge computing systems, autonomous agents must make fast local decisions while competing for shared resources. Existing MARL methods often resume to centralized critics or frequent communication, which fail under limited observability and communication constraints. We propose a decentralized framework in which each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), coordinating implicitly through a shared constraint vector. For the specific case of offloading, e.g., constraints prevent overloading shared server resources. Coordination constraints are updated infrequently and act as a lightweight coordination mechanism. They enable agents to align with global resource usage objectives but require little direct communication. Using safe reinforcement learning, agents learn policies that meet both local and global goals. We establish theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and validate our approach experimentally, showing improved performance over centralized and independent baselines, especially in large-scale settings.</description>

      <title>Building surrogate models using trajectories of agents trained by Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Sample efficiency in the face of computationally expensive simulations is a common concern in surrogate modeling. Current strategies to minimize the number of samples needed are not as effective in simulated environments with wide state spaces. As a response to this challenge, we propose a novel method to efficiently sample simulated deterministic environments by using policies trained by Reinforcement Learning. We provide an extensive analysis of these surrogate-building strategies with respect to Latin-Hypercube sampling or Active Learning and Kriging, cross-validating performances with all sampled datasets. The analysis shows that a mixed dataset that includes samples acquired by random agents, expert agents, and agents trained to explore the regions of maximum entropy of the state transition distribution provides the best scores through all datasets, which is crucial for a meaningful state space representation. We conclude that the proposed method improves the state-of-the-art and clears the path to enable the application of surrogate-aided Reinforcement Learning policy optimization strategies on complex simulators.</description>

Abstract: In a context where the social sciences and humanities are experimenting with non-anthropocentric analytical frames, this article proposes a semiotic (structural) reading of the hybridization between symbolic AI and neural (or sub-symbolic) AI based on a field of application: the design and use of a knowledge base for area studies. We describe the LaCAS ecosystem -- Open Archives in Linguistic and Cultural Studies (thesaurus; RDF/OWL ontology; LOD services; harvesting; expertise; publication), deployed at Inalco (National Institute for Oriental Languages and Civilizations) in Paris with the Okapi (Open Knowledge and Annotation Interface) software environment from Ina (National Audiovisual Institute), which now has around 160,000 documentary resources and ten knowledge macro-domains grouping together several thousand knowledge objects. We illustrate this approach using the knowledge domain ''Languages of the world'' (~540 languages) and the knowledge object ''Quechua (language)''. On this basis, we discuss the controlled integration of neural tools, more specifically generative tools, into the life cycle of a knowledge base: assistance with data localization/qualification, index extraction and aggregation, property suggestion and testing, dynamic file generation, and engineering of contextualized prompts (generic, contextual, explanatory, adjustment, procedural) aligned with a domain ontology. We outline an ecosystem of specialized agents capable of animating the database while respecting its symbolic constraints, by articulating model-driven and data-driven methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Trustworthy Vital Sign Forecasting: Leveraging Uncertainty for Prediction Intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vital signs, such as heart rate and blood pressure, are critical indicators of patient health and are widely used in clinical monitoring and decision-making. While deep learning models have shown promise in forecasting these signals, their deployment in healthcare remains limited in part because clinicians must be able to trust and interpret model outputs. Without reliable uncertainty quantification -- particularly calibrated prediction intervals (PIs) -- it is unclear whether a forecasted abnormality constitutes a meaningful warning or merely reflects model noise, hindering clinical decision-making. To address this, we present two methods for deriving PIs from the Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimate (RUE), an uncertainty measure well-suited to vital-sign forecasting due to its sensitivity to data shifts and support for label-free calibration. Our parametric approach assumes that prediction errors and uncertainty estimates follow a Gaussian copula distribution, enabling closed-form PI computation. Our non-parametric approach, based on k-nearest neighbours (KNN), empirically estimates the conditional error distribution using similar validation instances. We evaluate these methods on two large public datasets with minute- and hour-level sampling, representing high- and low-frequency health signals. Experiments demonstrate that the Gaussian copula method consistently outperforms conformal prediction baselines on low-frequency data, while the KNN approach performs best on high-frequency data. These results underscore the clinical promise of RUE-derived PIs for delivering interpretable, uncertainty-aware vital sign forecasts.</description>

      <title>LongCat-Flash Technical Report</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash, a 560-billion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model designed for both computational efficiency and advanced agentic capabilities. Stemming from the need for scalable efficiency, LongCat-Flash adopts two novel designs: (a) Zero-computation Experts, which enables dynamic computational budget allocation and activates 18.6B-31.3B (27B on average) per token depending on contextual demands, optimizing resource usage. (b) Shortcut-connected MoE, which enlarges the computation-communication overlap window, demonstrating notable gains in inference efficiency and throughput compared to models of a comparable scale. We develop a comprehensive scaling framework for large models that combines hyperparameter transfer, model-growth initialization, a multi-pronged stability suite, and deterministic computation to achieve stable and reproducible training. Notably, leveraging the synergy among scalable architectural design and infrastructure efforts, we complete model training on more than 20 trillion tokens within 30 days, while achieving over 100 tokens per second (TPS) for inference at a cost of \$0.70 per million output tokens. To cultivate LongCat-Flash towards agentic intelligence, we conduct a large-scale pre-training on optimized mixtures, followed by targeted mid- and post-training on reasoning, code, and instructions, with further augmentation from synthetic data and tool use tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that, as a non-thinking foundation model, LongCat-Flash delivers highly competitive performance among other leading models, with exceptional strengths in agentic tasks. The model checkpoint of LongCat-Flash is open-sourced to foster community research.

      <title>Multitask Battery Management with Flexible Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial-scale battery management involves various types of tasks, such as estimation, prediction, and system-level diagnostics. Each task employs distinct data across temporal scales, sensor resolutions, and data channels. Building task-specific methods requires a great deal of data and engineering effort, which limits the scalability of intelligent battery management. Here we present the Flexible Masked Autoencoder (FMAE), a flexible pretraining framework that can learn with missing battery data channels and capture inter-correlations across data snippets. FMAE learns unified battery representations from heterogeneous data and can be adopted by different tasks with minimal data and engineering efforts. Experimentally, FMAE consistently outperforms all task-specific methods across five battery management tasks with eleven battery datasets. On remaining life prediction tasks, FMAE uses 50 times less inference data while maintaining state-of-the-art results. Moreover, when real-world data lack certain information, such as system voltage, FMAE can still be applied with marginal performance impact, achieving comparable results with the best hand-crafted features. FMAE demonstrates a practical route to a flexible, data-efficient model that simplifies real-world multi-task management of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>LLM-Guided Semantic Relational Reasoning for Multimodal Intent Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding human intents from multimodal signals is critical for analyzing human behaviors and enhancing human-machine interactions in real-world scenarios. However, existing methods exhibit limitations in their modality-level reliance, constraining relational reasoning over fine-grained semantics for complex intent understanding. This paper proposes a novel LLM-Guided Semantic Relational Reasoning (LGSRR) method, which harnesses the expansive knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to establish semantic foundations that boost smaller models' relational reasoning performance. Specifically, an LLM-based strategy is proposed to extract fine-grained semantics as guidance for subsequent reasoning, driven by a shallow-to-deep Chain-of-Thought (CoT) that autonomously uncovers, describes, and ranks semantic cues by their importance without relying on manually defined priors. Besides, we formally model three fundamental types of semantic relations grounded in logical principles and analyze their nuanced interplay to enable more effective relational reasoning. Extensive experiments on multimodal intent and dialogue act recognition tasks demonstrate LGSRR's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, with consistent performance gains across diverse semantic understanding scenarios.

      <title>Street-Level Geolocalization Using Multimodal Large Language Models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Street-level geolocalization from images is crucial for a wide range of essential applications and services, such as navigation, location-based recommendations, and urban planning. With the growing popularity of social media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch, opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.</description>

      <title>AT Loss: Advanced Torrential Loss Function for Precipitation Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is becoming increasingly important in the context of climate change. In response, machine learning-based approaches have recently gained attention as an emerging alternative to traditional methods such as numerical weather prediction and climate models. Nonetheless, many recent approaches still rely on off-the-shelf loss functions, and even the more advanced ones merely involve optimization processes based on the critical success index (CSI). The problem, however, is that CSI may become ineffective during extended dry periods when precipitation remains below the threshold, rendering it less than ideal as a criterion for optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce a simple penalty expression and reinterpret it as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. Ultimately, the resulting QUBO formulation is relaxed into a differentiable advanced torrential (AT) loss function through an approximation process. The proposed AT loss demonstrates its superiority through the Lipschitz constant, forecast performance evaluations, consistency experiments, and ablation studies with the operational model.</description>

      <title>Causal Sensitivity Identification using Generative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generative method to identify the causal impact and apply it to prediction tasks. We conduct causal impact analysis using interventional and counterfactual perspectives. First, applying interventions, we identify features that have a causal influence on the predicted outcome, which we refer to as causally sensitive features, and second, applying counterfactuals, we evaluate how changes in the cause affect the effect. Our method exploits the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to identify the causal impact and serve as a generative predictor. We are able to reduce confounding bias by identifying causally sensitive features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by recommending the most likely locations a user will visit next in their spatiotemporal trajectory influenced by the causal relationships among various features. Experiments on the large-scale GeoLife [Zheng et al., 2010] dataset and the benchmark Asia Bayesian network validate the ability of our method to identify causal impact and improve predictive performance.</description>

      <title>DPF-CM: A Data Processing Framework with Privacy-Preserving Vector Databases for Chinese Medical LLMs Training and Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current open-source training pipelines for Chinese medical language models predominantly emphasize optimizing training methodologies to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs), yet lack comprehensive exploration into training data processing. To address this gap, we propose DPF-CM, a holistic Data Processing Framework for Chinese Medical LLMs training and deployment. DPF-CM comprises two core modules. The first module is a data processing pipeline tailored for model training. Beyond standard data processing operations, we (1) introduce a chained examples context-learning strategy to generate question-oriented instructions to mitigate the lack of instruction content, and (2) implement an ensemble-based filtering mechanism for preference data curation that averages multiple reward models to suppress noisy samples. The second module focuses on privacy preservation during model deployment. To prevent privacy risks from the inadvertent exposure of training data, we propose a Privacy Preserving Vector Database (PPVD) approach, which involves model memory search, high-risk database construction, secure database construction, and match-and-replace, four key stages to minimize privacy leakage during inference collectively. Experimental results show that DPF-CM significantly improves model accuracy, enabling our trained Chinese medical LLM to achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source counterparts. Moreover, the framework reduces training data privacy leakage by 27%.</description>

      <title>Uirapuru: Timely Video Analytics for High-Resolution Steerable Cameras on Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time video analytics on high-resolution cameras has become a popular technology for various intelligent services like traffic control and crowd monitoring. While extensive work has been done on improving analytics accuracy with timing guarantees, virtually all of them target static viewpoint cameras. In this paper, we present Uirapuru, a novel framework for real-time, edge-based video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras. The actuation performed by those cameras brings significant dynamism to the scene, presenting a critical challenge to existing popular approaches such as frame tiling. To address this problem, Uirapuru incorporates a comprehensive understanding of camera actuation into the system design paired with fast adaptive tiling at a per-frame level. We evaluate Uirapuru on a high-resolution video dataset, augmented by pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movements typical for steerable cameras and on real-world videos collected from an actual PTZ camera. Our experimental results show that Uirapuru provides up to 1.45x improvement in accuracy while respecting specified latency budgets or reaches up to 4.53x inference speedup with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.</description>

      <title>Anomaly detection in network flows using unsupervised online machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, the volume of network traffic continues to grow, along with the frequency and sophistication of attacks. This scenario highlights the need for solutions capable of continuously adapting, since network behavior is dynamic and changes over time. This work presents an anomaly detection model for network flows using unsupervised machine learning with online learning capabilities. This approach allows the system to dynamically learn the normal behavior of the network and detect deviations without requiring labeled data, which is particularly useful in real-world environments where traffic is constantly changing and labeled data is scarce. The model was implemented using the River library with a One-Class SVM and evaluated on the NF-UNSW-NB15 dataset and its extended version v2, which contain network flows labeled with different attack categories. The results show an accuracy above 98%, a false positive rate below 3.1%, and a recall of 100% in the most advanced version of the dataset. In addition, the low processing time per flow (&lt;0.033 ms) demonstrates the feasibility of the approach for real-time applications.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic levitation is poised to revolutionize industrial automation by integrating flexible in-machine product transport and seamless manipulation. It is expected to become the standard drive for automated manufacturing. However, controlling such systems is inherently challenging due to their complex, unstable dynamics. Traditional control approaches, which rely on hand-crafted control engineering, typically yield robust but conservative solutions, with their performance closely tied to the expertise of the engineering team. In contrast, neural control learning presents a promising alternative. This paper presents the first neural controller for 6D magnetic levitation. Trained end-to-end on interaction data from a proprietary controller, it directly maps raw sensor data and 6D reference poses to coil current commands. The neural controller can effectively generalize to previously unseen situations while maintaining accurate and robust control. These results underscore the practical feasibility of learning-based neural control in complex physical systems and suggest a future where such a paradigm could enhance or even substitute traditional engineering approaches in demanding real-world applications.

      <title>LLMs cannot spot math errors, even when allowed to peek into the solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on math word problems, yet they have been shown to struggle with meta-reasoning tasks such as identifying errors in student solutions. In this work, we investigate the challenge of locating the first error step in stepwise solutions using two error reasoning datasets: VtG and PRM800K. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to locate the first error step in student solutions even when given access to the reference solution. To that end, we propose an approach that generates an intermediate corrected student solution, aligning more closely with the original student's solution, which helps improve performance.</description>

      <title>CabinSep: IR-Augmented Mask-Based MVDR for Real-Time In-Car Speech Separation with Distributed Heterogeneous Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Separating overlapping speech from multiple speakers is crucial for effective human-vehicle interaction. This paper proposes CabinSep, a lightweight neural mask-based minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) speech separation approach, to reduce speech recognition errors in back-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models. Our contributions are threefold: First, we utilize channel information to extract spatial features, which improves the estimation of speech and noise masks. Second, we employ MVDR during inference, reducing speech distortion to make it more ASR-friendly. Third, we introduce a data augmentation method combining simulated and real-recorded impulse responses (IRs), improving speaker localization at zone boundaries and further reducing speech recognition errors. With a computational complexity of only 0.4 GMACs, CabinSep achieves a 17.5% relative reduction in speech recognition error rate in a real-recorded dataset compared to the state-of-the-art DualSep model. Demos are available at: https://cabinsep.github.io/cabinsep/.</description>

      <title>DCA: Graph-Guided Deep Embedding Clustering for Brain Atlases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain atlases are essential for reducing the dimensionality of neuroimaging data and enabling interpretable analysis. However, most existing atlases are predefined, group-level templates with limited flexibility and resolution. We present Deep Cluster Atlas (DCA), a graph-guided deep embedding clustering framework for generating individualized, voxel-wise brain parcellations. DCA combines a pretrained autoencoder with spatially regularized deep clustering to produce functionally coherent and spatially contiguous regions. Our method supports flexible control over resolution and anatomical scope, and generalizes to arbitrary brain structures. We further introduce a standardized benchmarking platform for atlas evaluation, using multiple large-scale fMRI datasets. Across multiple datasets and scales, DCA outperforms state-of-the-art atlases, improving functional homogeneity by 98.8\% and silhouette coefficient by 29\%, and achieves superior performance in downstream tasks such as autism diagnosis and cognitive decoding. Codes and models will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Unnoticeable Community Deception via Multi-objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection in graphs is crucial for understanding the organization of nodes into densely connected clusters. While numerous strategies have been developed to identify these clusters, the success of community detection can lead to privacy and information security concerns, as individuals may not want their personal information exposed. To address this, community deception methods have been proposed to reduce the effectiveness of detection algorithms. Nevertheless, several limitations, such as the rationality of evaluation metrics and the unnoticeability of attacks, have been ignored in current deception methods. Therefore, in this work, we first investigate the limitations of the widely used deception metric, i.e., the decrease of modularity, through empirical studies. Then, we propose a new deception metric, and combine this new metric together with the attack budget to model the unnoticeable community deception task as a multi-objective optimization problem. To further improve the deception performance, we propose two variant methods by incorporating the degree-biased and community-biased candidate node selection mechanisms. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed community deception strategies.</description>

      <title>SoccerHigh: A Benchmark Dataset for Automatic Soccer Video Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video summarization aims to extract key shots from longer videos to produce concise and informative summaries. One of its most common applications is in sports, where highlight reels capture the most important moments of a game, along with notable reactions and specific contextual events. Automatic summary generation can support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing the time and effort required to identify key segments. However, the lack of publicly available datasets poses a challenge in developing robust models for sports highlight generation. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a curated dataset for soccer video summarization, designed to serve as a benchmark for the task. The dataset includes shot boundaries for 237 matches from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues, using broadcast footage sourced from the SoccerNet dataset. Alongside the dataset, we propose a baseline model specifically designed for this task, which achieves an F1 score of 0.3956 in the test set. Furthermore, we propose a new metric constrained by the length of each target summary, enabling a more objective evaluation of the generated content. The dataset and code are available at https://ipcv.github.io/SoccerHigh/.</description>

      <title>Do Retrieval Augmented Language Models Know When They Don't Know?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) occasionally generate plausible yet factually incorrect responses, known as hallucinations. Researchers are primarily using two approaches to mitigate hallucinations, namely Retrieval Augmented Language Models (RALMs) and refusal post-training. However, current research predominantly emphasizes their individual effectiveness while overlooking the evaluation of the refusal capability of RALMs. In this study, we ask the fundamental question: Do RALMs know when they don't know? Specifically, we ask three questions. First, are RALMs well-calibrated regarding different internal and external knowledge states? We examine the influence of various factors. Contrary to expectations, we find that LLMs exhibit significant \textbf{over-refusal} behavior. Then, how does refusal post-training affect the over-refusal issue? We investigate the Refusal-aware Instruction Tuning and In-Context Fine-tuning methods. Our results show that the over-refusal problem is mitigated by In-context fine-tuning. but magnified by R-tuning. However, we also find that the refusal ability may conflict with the quality of the answer. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective refusal method for refusal post-trained models to improve their overall answer quality in terms of refusal and correct answers. Our study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the influence of important factors on RALM systems.</description>

      <title>An Information-Flow Perspective on Explainability Requirements: Specification and Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable systems expose information about why certain observed effects are happening to the agents interacting with them. We argue that this constitutes a positive flow of information that needs to be specified, verified, and balanced against negative information flow that may, e.g., violate privacy guarantees. Since both explainability and privacy require reasoning about knowledge, we tackle these tasks with epistemic temporal logic extended with quantification over counterfactual causes. This allows us to specify that a multi-agent system exposes enough information such that agents acquire knowledge on why some effect occurred. We show how this principle can be used to specify explainability as a system-level requirement and provide an algorithm for checking finite-state models against such specifications. We present a prototype implementation of the algorithm and evaluate it on several benchmarks, illustrating how our approach distinguishes between explainable and unexplainable systems, and how it allows to pose additional privacy requirements.</description>

      <title>MSA2-Net: Utilizing Self-Adaptive Convolution Module to Extract Multi-Scale Information in Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module, to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps. Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder, utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving Dice coefficient scores of 86.49\%, 92.56\%, 93.37\%, and 92.98\% on the Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets, respectively. This underscores MSA2-Net's robustness and precision in medical image segmentation tasks across various datasets.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Identification and Replay-based Detection (UIRD) for New Category Anomaly Detection in ECG Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In clinical practice, automatic analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely applied to identify irregular heart rhythms and other electrical anomalies of the heart, enabling timely intervention and potentially improving clinical outcomes. However, due to the limited samples in certain types of ECG signals, the class imbalance issues pose a challenge for ECG-based detection. In addition, as the volume of patient data grows, long-term storage of all historical data becomes increasingly burdensome as training samples to recognize new patterns and classify existing ECG signals accurately. Therefore, to enhance the performance of anomaly detection while addressing storage limitations, we propose a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual learning framework, which consists of two components: unsupervised identification and replay-based detection. For unsupervised identification, an unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework is integrated to detect novel patterns. Besides, instead of directly storing all historical data, a pseudo replay-based learning strategy is proposed which utilizes a generator to learn the data distribution for each individual task. When a new task arises, the generator synthesizes pseudo data representative of previous learnt classes, enabling the model to detect both the existed patterns and the newly presented anomalies. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated in four public ECG datasets, which leverages supervised classification problems for anomaly detection. The experimental results show that the developed approach is very promising in identifying novel anomalies while maintaining good performance on detecting existing ECG signals.</description>

      <title>MeVe: A Modular System for Memory Verification and Effective Context Control in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically face constraints because of their inherent mechanism: a simple top-k semantic search [1]. The approach often leads to the incorporation of irrelevant or redundant information in the context, degrading performance and efficiency [10][11]. This paper presents MeVe, a novel modular architecture intended for Memory Verification and smart context composition. MeVe rethinks the RAG paradigm by proposing a five-phase modular design that distinctly breaks down the retrieval and context composition process into distinct, auditable, and independently tunable phases: initial retrieval, relevance verification, fallback retrieval, context prioritization, and token budgeting. This architecture enables fine-grained control of what knowledge is made available to an LLM, enabling task-dependent filtering and adaptation. We release a reference implementation of MeVe as a proof of concept and evaluate its performance on knowledge-heavy QA tasks over a subset of English Wikipedia [22]. Our results demonstrate that by actively verifying information before composition, MeVe significantly improves context efficiency, achieving a 57% reduction on the Wikipedia dataset and a 75% reduction on the more complex HotpotQA dataset compared to standard RAG implementations [25]. This work provides a framework for more scalable and reliable LLM applications. By refining and distilling contextual information, MeVe offers a path toward better grounding and more accurate factual support [16].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents, agentic workflows are showing transformative potential in education. This study introduces the Agentic Workflow for Education (AWE), a four-component model comprising self-reflection, tool invocation, task planning, and multi-agent collaboration. We distinguish AWE from traditional LLM-based linear interactions and propose a theoretical framework grounded in the von Neumann Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture. Through a paradigm shift from static prompt-response systems to dynamic, nonlinear workflows, AWE enables scalable, personalized, and collaborative task execution. We further identify four core application domains: integrated learning environments, personalized AI-assisted learning, simulation-based experimentation, and data-driven decision-making. A case study on automated math test generation shows that AWE-generated items are statistically comparable to real exam questions, validating the model's effectiveness. AWE offers a promising path toward reducing teacher workload, enhancing instructional quality, and enabling broader educational innovation.</description>

      <title>CAT: Causal Attention Tuning For Injecting Fine-grained Causal Knowledge into Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains. However, a fundamental question remains: Can LLMs effectively utilize causal knowledge for prediction and generation? Through empirical studies, we find that LLMs trained directly on large-scale data often capture spurious correlations rather than true causal relationships, leading to suboptimal performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose Causal Attention Tuning (CAT), a novel approach that injects fine-grained causal knowledge into the attention mechanism. We propose an automated pipeline that leverages human priors to automatically generate token-level causal signals and introduce the Re-Attention mechanism to guide training, helping the model focus on causal structures while mitigating noise and biases in attention scores. Experimental results on our proposed Spurious Token Game (STG) benchmark and multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our approach effectively leverages causal knowledge for prediction and remains robust in OOD scenarios. Implementation details can be found at https://github.com/Kairong-Han/CAT.</description>

      <title>Unified Supervision For Vision-Language Modeling in 3D Computed Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools in radiology, offering zero-shot capabilities that mitigate the need for large labeled datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like diagnostic radiology, these models often lack the discriminative precision required for reliable clinical use. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and heterogeneity of publicly available volumetric CT datasets, which vary widely in annotation formats and granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce Uniferum, a volumetric VLM that unifies diverse supervision signals, encoded in classification labels and segmentation masks, into a single training framework. By harmonizing three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, Uniferum achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark by 7% compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label convolutional models. The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, with observed evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on the RAD-CHEST and INSPECT datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous annotations and body segmentation to enhance model performance, setting a new direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.</description>

      <title>In-N-Out: A Parameter-Level API Graph Dataset for Tool Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tool agents -- LLM-based systems that interact with external APIs -- offer a way to execute real-world tasks. However, as tasks become increasingly complex, these agents struggle to identify and call the correct APIs in the proper order. To tackle this problem, we investigate converting API documentation into a structured API graph that captures API dependencies and leveraging it for multi-tool queries that require compositional API calls. To support this, we introduce In-N-Out, the first expert-annotated dataset of API graphs built from two real-world API benchmarks and their documentation. Using In-N-Out significantly improves performance on both tool retrieval and multi-tool query generation, nearly doubling that of LLMs using documentation alone. Moreover, graphs generated by models fine-tuned on In-N-Out close 90% of this gap, showing that our dataset helps models learn to comprehend API documentation and parameter relationships. Our findings highlight the promise of using explicit API graphs for tool agents and the utility of In-N-Out as a valuable resource. We will release the dataset and code publicly.</description>

Abstract: Trisomy 21 results in Down syndrome, a multifaceted genetic disorder with diverse clinical phenotypes, including heart defects, immune dysfunction, neurodevelopmental differences, and early-onset dementia risk. Heterogeneity and fragmented data across studies challenge comprehensive research and translational discovery. The NIH INCLUDE (INvestigation of Co-occurring conditions across the Lifespan to Understand Down syndromE) initiative has assembled harmonized participant-level datasets, yet realizing their potential requires integrative analytical frameworks. We developed a knowledge graph-driven platform transforming nine INCLUDE studies, comprising 7,148 participants, 456 conditions, 501 phenotypes, and over 37,000 biospecimens, into a unified semantic infrastructure. Cross-resource enrichment with Monarch Initiative data expands coverage to 4,281 genes and 7,077 variants. The resulting knowledge graph contains over 1.6 million semantic associations, enabling AI-ready analysis with graph embeddings and path-based reasoning for hypothesis generation. Researchers can query the graph via SPARQL or natural language interfaces. This framework converts static data repositories into dynamic discovery environments, supporting cross-study pattern recognition, predictive modeling, and systematic exploration of genotype-phenotype relationships in Down syndrome.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Clustering for Federated Learning Under Clustering-Agnostic Assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widespread and well-adopted paradigm of decentralised learning that allows training one model from multiple sources without the need to transfer data between participating clients directly. Since its inception in 2015, it has been divided into numerous subfields that deal with application-specific issues, such as data heterogeneity or resource allocation. One such sub-field, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), deals with the problem of clustering the population of clients into separate cohorts to deliver personalised models. Although a few remarkable works have been published in this domain, the problem remains largely unexplored, as its basic assumptions and settings differ slightly from those of standard FL. In this work, we present One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL), a clustering-agnostic algorithm that can automatically detect the earliest suitable moment for clustering. Our algorithm is based on computing the cosine distance between the gradients of the clients and a temperature measure that detects when the federated model starts to converge. We empirically evaluate our methodology by testing various one-shot clustering algorithms for over forty different tasks on five benchmark datasets. Our experiments showcase the good performance of our approach when used to perform CFL in an automated manner without the need to adjust hyperparameters. We also revisit the practical feasibility of CFL algorithms based on the gradients of the clients, providing firm evidence of the high efficiency of density-based clustering methods when used to differentiate between the loss surfaces of neural networks trained on different distributions. Moreover, by inspecting the feasibility of local explanations generated with the help of GradCAM, we can provide more insights into the relationship between personalisation and the explainability of local predictions.</description>

      <title>From Discord to Harmony: Decomposed Consonance-based Training for Improved Audio Chord Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio Chord Estimation (ACE) holds a pivotal role in music information research, having garnered attention for over two decades due to its relevance for music transcription and analysis. Despite notable advancements, challenges persist in the task, particularly concerning unique characteristics of harmonic content, which have resulted in existing systems' performances reaching a glass ceiling. These challenges include annotator subjectivity, where varying interpretations among annotators lead to inconsistencies, and class imbalance within chord datasets, where certain chord classes are over-represented compared to others, posing difficulties in model training and evaluation. As a first contribution, this paper presents an evaluation of inter-annotator agreement in chord annotations, using metrics that extend beyond traditional binary measures. In addition, we propose a consonance-informed distance metric that reflects the perceptual similarity between harmonic annotations. Our analysis suggests that consonance-based distance metrics more effectively capture musically meaningful agreement between annotations. Expanding on these findings, we introduce a novel ACE conformer-based model that integrates consonance concepts into the model through consonance-based label smoothing. The proposed model also addresses class imbalance by separately estimating root, bass, and all note activations, enabling the reconstruction of chord labels from decomposed outputs.</description>

      <title>Securing Radiation Detection Systems with an Efficient TinyML-Based IDS for Edge Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation Detection Systems (RDSs) play a vital role in ensuring public safety across various settings, from nuclear facilities to medical environments. However, these systems are increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks such as data injection, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, ICMP floods, botnet attacks, privilege escalation, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Such threats could compromise the integrity and reliability of radiation measurements, posing significant public health and safety risks. This paper presents a new synthetic radiation dataset and an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) tailored for resource-constrained environments, bringing Machine Learning (ML) predictive capabilities closer to the sensing edge layer of critical infrastructure. Leveraging TinyML techniques, the proposed IDS employs an optimized XGBoost model enhanced with pruning, quantization, feature selection, and sampling. These TinyML techniques significantly reduce the size of the model and computational demands, enabling real-time intrusion detection on low-resource devices while maintaining a reasonable balance between efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>O-DisCo-Edit: Object Distortion Control for Unified Realistic Video Editing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video editing, yet controllable editing remains challenging due to the need for precise manipulation of diverse object properties. Current methods require different control signal for diverse editing tasks, which complicates model design and demands significant training resources. To address this, we propose O-DisCo-Edit, a unified framework that incorporates a novel object distortion control (O-DisCo). This signal, based on random and adaptive noise, flexibly encapsulates a wide range of editing cues within a single representation. Paired with a "copy-form" preservation module for preserving non-edited regions, O-DisCo-Edit enables efficient, high-fidelity editing through an effective training paradigm. Extensive experiments and comprehensive human evaluations consistently demonstrate that O-DisCo-Edit surpasses both specialized and multitask state-of-the-art methods across various video editing tasks. https://cyqii.github.io/O-DisCo-Edit.github.io/</description>

      <title>An Efficient Intrusion Detection System for Safeguarding Radiation Detection Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation Detection Systems (RDSs) are used to measure and detect abnormal levels of radioactive material in the environment. These systems are used in many applications to mitigate threats posed by high levels of radioactive material. However, these systems lack protection against malicious external attacks to modify the data. The novelty of applying Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in RDSs is a crucial element in safeguarding these critical infrastructures. While IDSs are widely used in networking environments to safeguard against various attacks, their application in RDSs is novel. A common attack on RDSs is Denial of Service (DoS), where the attacker aims to overwhelm the system, causing malfunctioning RDSs. This paper proposes an efficient Machine Learning (ML)-based IDS to detect anomalies in radiation data, focusing on DoS attacks. This work explores the use of sampling methods to create a simulated DoS attack based on a real radiation dataset, followed by an evaluation of various ML algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), logistic regression, and Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM), to detect DoS attacks on RDSs. LightGBM is emphasized for its superior accuracy and low computational resource consumption, making it particularly suitable for real-time intrusion detection. Additionally, model optimization and TinyML techniques, including feature selection, parallel execution, and random search methods, are used to improve the efficiency of the proposed IDS. Finally, an optimized and efficient LightGBM-based IDS is developed to achieve accurate intrusion detection for RDSs.</description>

      <title>TransForSeg: A Multitask Stereo ViT for Joint Stereo Segmentation and 3D Force Estimation in Catheterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in both catheter segmentation and force estimation.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Driven Curriculum for Multi-Task Training in Human Mobility Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing availability of big mobility data from ubiquitous portable devices enables human mobility prediction through deep learning approaches. However, the diverse complexity of human mobility data impedes model training, leading to inefficient gradient updates and potential underfitting. Meanwhile, exclusively predicting next locations neglects implicit determinants, including distances and directions, thereby yielding suboptimal prediction results. This paper presents a unified training framework that integrates entropy-driven curriculum and multi-task learning to address these challenges. The proposed entropy-driven curriculum learning strategy quantifies trajectory predictability based on Lempel-Ziv compression and organizes training from simple to complex for faster convergence and enhanced performance. The multi-task training simultaneously optimizes the primary location prediction alongside auxiliary estimation of movement distance and direction for learning realistic mobility patterns, and improve prediction accuracy through complementary supervision signals. Extensive experiments conducted in accordance with the HuMob Challenge demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on GEO-BLEU (0.354) and DTW (26.15) metrics with up to 2.92-fold convergence speed compared to training without curriculum learning.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the schema turn: Restoring the information base to conceptual modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If one looks at contemporary mainstream development practices for conceptual modelling in computer science, these so clearly focus on a conceptual schema completely separated from its information base that the conceptual schema is often just called the conceptual model. These schema-centric practices are crystallized in almost every database textbook. We call this strong, almost universal, bias towards conceptual schemas the schema turn. The focus of this paper is on disentangling this turn within (computer science) conceptual modeling. It aims to shed some light on how it emerged and so show that it is not fundamental. To show that modern technology enables the adoption of an inclusive schema-and-base conceptual modelling approach, which in turn enables more automated, and empirically motivated practices. And to show, more generally, the space of possible conceptual modelling practices is wider than currently assumed. It also uses the example of bCLEARer to show that the implementations in this wider space will probably need to rely on new pipeline-based conceptual modelling techniques. So, it is possible that the schema turn's complete exclusion of the information base could be merely a temporary evolutionary detour.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the Detection of LLMs-Generated Modern Chinese Poetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of advanced large language models (LLMs) has made AI-generated text indistinguishable from human-written text. Previous work on detecting AI-generated text has made effective progress, but has not involved modern Chinese poetry. Due to the distinctive characteristics of modern Chinese poetry, it is difficult to identify whether a poem originated from humans or AI. The proliferation of AI-generated modern Chinese poetry has significantly disrupted the poetry ecosystem. Based on the urgency of identifying AI-generated poetry in the real Chinese world, this paper proposes a novel benchmark for detecting LLMs-generated modern Chinese poetry. We first construct a high-quality dataset, which includes both 800 poems written by six professional poets and 41,600 poems generated by four mainstream LLMs. Subsequently, we conduct systematic performance assessments of six detectors on this dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that current detectors cannot be used as reliable tools to detect modern Chinese poems generated by LLMs. The most difficult poetic features to detect are intrinsic qualities, especially style. The detection results verify the effectiveness and necessity of our proposed benchmark. Our work lays a foundation for future detection of AI-generated poetry.</description>

      <title>Q-Sched: Pushing the Boundaries of Few-Step Diffusion Models with Quantization-Aware Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance, Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a 2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss, which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration. Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16 4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.</description>

      <title>Non-Identical Diffusion Models in MIMO-OFDM Channel Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion model, termed the non-identical diffusion model, and investigate its application to wireless orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) channel generation. Unlike the standard diffusion model that uses a scalar-valued time index to represent the global noise level, we extend this notion to an element-wise time indicator to capture local error variations more accurately. Non-identical diffusion enables us to characterize the reliability of each element (e.g., subcarriers in OFDM) within the noisy input, leading to improved generation results when the initialization is biased. Specifically, we focus on the recovery of wireless multi-input multi-output (MIMO) OFDM channel matrices, where the initial channel estimates exhibit highly uneven reliability across elements due to the pilot scheme. Conventional time embeddings, which assume uniform noise progression, fail to capture such variability across pilot schemes and noise levels. We introduce a matrix that matches the input size to control element-wise noise progression. Following a similar diffusion procedure to existing methods, we show the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed non-identical diffusion scheme both theoretically and numerically. For MIMO-OFDM channel generation, we propose a dimension-wise time embedding strategy. We also develop and evaluate multiple training and generation methods and compare them through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Data Retrieval with Importance Weights for Few-Shot Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large-scale robot datasets have propelled recent progress in imitation learning, learning from smaller task specific datasets remains critical for deployment in new environments and unseen tasks. One such approach to few-shot imitation learning is retrieval-based imitation learning, which extracts relevant samples from large, widely available prior datasets to augment a limited demonstration dataset. To determine the relevant data from prior datasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly calculate a prior data point's minimum distance to a point in the target dataset in latent space. While retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric for data selection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel density (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution. This reveals two shortcomings of the retrieval rule used in prior work. First, it relies on high-variance nearest neighbor estimates that are susceptible to noise. Second, it does not account for the distribution of prior data when retrieving data. To address these issues, we introduce Importance Weighted Retrieval (IWR), which estimates importance weights, or the ratio between the target and prior data distributions for retrieval, using Gaussian KDEs. By considering the probability ratio, IWR seeks to mitigate the bias of previous selection rules, and by using reasonable modeling parameters, IWR effectively smooths estimates using all data points. Across both simulation environments and real-world evaluations on the Bridge dataset we find that our method, IWR, consistently improves performance of existing retrieval-based methods, despite only requiring minor modifications.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Machine Learning Engineering Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing agents for solving tasks such as ML engineering rely on prompting powerful language models. As a result, these agents do not improve with more experience. In this paper, we show that agents backed by weaker models that improve via reinforcement learning (RL) can outperform agents backed by much larger, but static models. We identify two major challenges with RL in this setting. First, actions can take a variable amount of time (e.g., executing code for different solutions), which leads to asynchronous policy gradient updates that favor faster but suboptimal solutions. To tackle variable-duration actions, we propose duration- aware gradient updates in a distributed asynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions. Second, using only test split performance as a reward provides limited feedback. A program that is nearly correct is treated the same as one that fails entirely. To address this, we propose environment instrumentation to offer partial credit, distinguishing almost-correct programs from those that fail early (e.g., during data loading). Environment instrumentation uses a separate static language model to insert print statement to an existing program to log the agent's experimental progress, from which partial credit can be extracted as reward signals for learning. Our experimental results on MLEBench suggest that performing gradient updates on a much smaller model (Qwen2.5-3B) trained with RL outperforms prompting a much larger model (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) with agent scaffolds, by an average of 22% across 12 Kaggle tasks.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Rock Particulate Classification Using Attention-Enhanced ConvNeXt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical engineering, mining, and resource management, where precise estimation influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures like rocks.</description>

      <title>chDzDT: Word-level morphology-aware language model for Algerian social media text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have substantially advanced natural language processing by providing context-sensitive text representations. However, the Algerian dialect remains under-represented, with few dedicated models available. Processing this dialect is challenging due to its complex morphology, frequent code-switching, multiple scripts, and strong lexical influences from other languages. These characteristics complicate tokenization and reduce the effectiveness of conventional word- or subword-level approaches.
  To address this gap, we introduce chDzDT, a character-level pre-trained language model tailored for Algerian morphology. Unlike conventional PLMs that rely on token sequences, chDzDT is trained on isolated words. This design allows the model to encode morphological patterns robustly, without depending on token boundaries or standardized orthography. The training corpus draws from diverse sources, including YouTube comments, French, English, and Berber Wikipedia, as well as the Tatoeba project. It covers multiple scripts and linguistic varieties, resulting in a substantial pre-training workload.
  Our contributions are threefold: (i) a detailed morphological analysis of Algerian dialect using YouTube comments; (ii) the construction of a multilingual Algerian lexicon dataset; and (iii) the development and extensive evaluation of a character-level PLM as a morphology-focused encoder for downstream tasks. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential of character-level modeling for morphologically rich, low-resource dialects and lays a foundation for more inclusive and adaptable NLP systems.</description>

      <title>AHAMask: Reliable Task Specification for Large Audio Language Models without Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although current large audio language models (LALMs) extend text large language models (LLMs) with generic acoustic understanding abilities, they usually suffer from instruction sensitivity, where different instructions of the same intention can yield drastically different outcomes. In this work, we propose AHAMask, where we simply mask some of the attention heads in the decoder-only LLM backbone of LALMs, to trigger specific acoustic task functionalities without instructions. These masks are efficiently obtained by training on an LALM, with the number of trainable parameters equal to the attention head count in its LLM backbone. We show by experiments that applying such selective attention head masks achieves comparable or even better performance than using instructions, either on single or composite tasks. Besides achieving reliable acoustic task specification for LALMs, this also reveals that LALMs exhibit certain "functional pathways" in their attention heads.</description>

      <title>Flaw or Artifact? Rethinking Prompt Sensitivity in Evaluating LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prompt sensitivity, referring to the phenomenon where paraphrasing (i.e., repeating something written or spoken using different words) leads to significant changes in large language model (LLM) performance, has been widely accepted as a core limitation of LLMs. In this work, we revisit this issue and ask: Is the widely reported high prompt sensitivity truly an inherent weakness of LLMs, or is it largely an artifact of evaluation processes? To answer this question, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family) across 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12 diverse prompt templates. We find that much of the prompt sensitivity stems from heuristic evaluation methods, including log-likelihood scoring and rigid answer matching, which often overlook semantically correct responses expressed through alternative phrasings, such as synonyms or paraphrases. When we adopt LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, we observe a substantial reduction in performance variance and a consistently higher correlation in model rankings across prompts. Our findings suggest that modern LLMs are more robust to prompt templates than previously believed, and that prompt sensitivity may be more an artifact of evaluation than a flaw in the models.</description>

      <title>E-PhishGen: Unlocking Novel Research in Phishing Email Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every day, our inboxes are flooded with unsolicited emails, ranging between annoying spam to more subtle phishing scams. Unfortunately, despite abundant prior efforts proposing solutions achieving near-perfect accuracy, the reality is that countering malicious emails still remains an unsolved dilemma.
  This "open problem" paper carries out a critical assessment of scientific works in the context of phishing email detection. First, we focus on the benchmark datasets that have been used to assess the methods proposed in research. We find that most prior work relied on datasets containing emails that -- we argue -- are not representative of current trends, and mostly encompass the English language. Based on this finding, we then re-implement and re-assess a variety of detection methods reliant on machine learning (ML), including large-language models (LLM), and release all of our codebase -- an (unfortunately) uncommon practice in related research. We show that most such methods achieve near-perfect performance when trained and tested on the same dataset -- a result which intrinsically hinders development (how can future research outperform methods that are already near perfect?). To foster the creation of "more challenging benchmarks" that reflect current phishing trends, we propose E-PhishGEN, an LLM-based (and privacy-savvy) framework to generate novel phishing-email datasets. We use our E-PhishGEN to create E-PhishLLM, a novel phishing-email detection dataset containing 16616 emails in three languages. We use E-PhishLLM to test the detectors we considered, showing a much lower performance than that achieved on existing benchmarks -- indicating a larger room for improvement. We also validate the quality of E-PhishLLM with a user study (n=30). To sum up, we show that phishing email detection is still an open problem -- and provide the means to tackle such a problem by future research.</description>

      <title>Toward a Unified Benchmark and Taxonomy of Stochastic Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents have achieved strong results on benchmarks such as Atari100k, yet they remain limited in robustness to real-world conditions. Model-Based RL approaches that rely on learned World Models often struggle in environments with true stochasticity and partial observability, despite their theoretical grounding in POMDPs. Current benchmarks rarely capture these challenges, focusing instead on deterministic or overly simplified settings, and the lack of a clear taxonomy of stochasticity further hampers systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce STORI (STOchastic-ataRI), a benchmark that incorporates diverse stochastic effects and enables rigorous assessment of RL methods under varied forms of uncertainty. In addition, we propose a taxonomy of stochasticity in RL environments, providing a unified framework for analyzing and comparing approaches.</description>

      <title>A Multi-target Bayesian Transformer Framework for Predicting Cardiovascular Disease Biomarkers during Pandemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare systems worldwide, disproportionately impacting individuals with chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease (CVD). These disruptions -- through delayed care and behavioral changes, affected key CVD biomarkers, including LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), HbA1c, BMI, and systolic blood pressure (SysBP). Accurate modeling of these changes is crucial for predicting disease progression and guiding preventive care. However, prior work has not addressed multi-target prediction of CVD biomarker from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using machine learning (ML), while jointly capturing biomarker interdependencies, temporal patterns, and predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose MBT-CB, a Multi-target Bayesian Transformer (MBT) with pre-trained BERT-based transformer framework to jointly predict LDL-C, HbA1c, BMI and SysBP CVD biomarkers from EHR data. The model leverages Bayesian Variational Inference to estimate uncertainties, embeddings to capture temporal relationships and a DeepMTR model to capture biomarker inter-relationships. We evaluate MBT-CT on retrospective EHR data from 3,390 CVD patient records (304 unique patients) in Central Massachusetts during the Covid-19 pandemic. MBT-CB outperformed a comprehensive set of baselines including other BERT-based ML models, achieving an MAE of 0.00887, RMSE of 0.0135 and MSE of 0.00027, while effectively capturing data and model uncertainty, patient biomarker inter-relationships, and temporal dynamics via its attention and embedding mechanisms. MBT-CB's superior performance highlights its potential to improve CVD biomarker prediction and support clinical decision-making during pandemics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrusion detection in unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) swarms is complicated by high mobility, non-stationary traffic, and severe class imbalance. Leveraging a 120 k-flow simulation corpus that covers five attack types, we benchmark three quantum-machine-learning (QML) approaches - quantum kernels, variational quantum neural networks (QNNs), and hybrid quantum-trained neural networks (QT-NNs) - against strong classical baselines. All models consume an 8-feature flow representation and are evaluated under identical preprocessing, balancing, and noise-model assumptions. We analyse the influence of encoding strategy, circuit depth, qubit count, and shot noise, reporting accuracy, macro-F1, ROC-AUC, Matthews correlation, and quantum-resource footprints. Results reveal clear trade-offs: quantum kernels and QT-NNs excel in low-data, nonlinear regimes, while deeper QNNs suffer from trainability issues, and CNNs dominate when abundant data offset their larger parameter count. The complete codebase and dataset partitions are publicly released to enable reproducible QML research in network security.</description>

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for "AI interviewers" that can administer voice-based surveys with respondents in real-time. This position paper reviews emerging evidence to understand when such AI interviewing systems are fit for purpose for collecting data within quantitative and qualitative research contexts. We evaluate the capabilities of AI interviewers as well as current Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems across two dimensions: input/output performance (i.e., speech recognition, answer recording, emotion handling) and verbal reasoning (i.e., ability to probe, clarify, and handle branching logic). Field studies suggest that AI interviewers already exceed IVR capabilities for both quantitative and qualitative data collection, but real-time transcription error rates, limited emotion detection abilities, and uneven follow-up quality indicate that the utility, use and adoption of current AI interviewer technology may be context-dependent for qualitative data collection efforts.</description>

      <title>When LLM Meets Time Series: Can LLMs Perform Multi-Step Time Series Reasoning and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked growing interest in their application to time series analysis tasks. However, their ability to perform complex reasoning over temporal data in real-world application domains remains underexplored. To move toward this goal, a first step is to establish a rigorous benchmark dataset for evaluation. In this work, we introduce the TSAIA Benchmark, a first attempt to evaluate LLMs as time-series AI assistants. To ensure both scientific rigor and practical relevance, we surveyed over 20 academic publications and identified 33 real-world task formulations. The benchmark encompasses a broad spectrum of challenges, ranging from constraint-aware forecasting to anomaly detection with threshold calibration: tasks that require compositional reasoning and multi-step time series analysis. The question generator is designed to be dynamic and extensible, supporting continuous expansion as new datasets or task types are introduced. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tasks, we adopt task-specific success criteria and tailored inference-quality metrics to ensure meaningful evaluation for each task. We apply this benchmark to assess eight state-of-the-art LLMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our analysis reveals limitations in current models' ability to assemble complex time series analysis workflows, underscoring the need for specialized methodologies for domain-specific adaptation. Our benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Melady/TSAIA, and the code is available at https://github.com/USC-Melady/TSAIA.</description>

      <title>Journalists' Perceptions of Artificial Intelligence and Disinformation Risks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines journalists' perceptions of the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on disinformation, a growing concern in journalism due to the rapid expansion of generative AI and its influence on news production and media organizations. Using a quantitative approach, a structured survey was administered to 504 journalists in the Basque Country, identified through official media directories and with the support of the Basque Association of Journalists. This survey, conducted online and via telephone between May and June 2024, included questions on sociodemographic and professional variables, as well as attitudes toward AI's impact on journalism. The results indicate that a large majority of journalists (89.88%) believe AI will considerably or significantly increase the risks of disinformation, and this perception is consistent across genders and media types, but more pronounced among those with greater professional experience. Statistical analyses reveal a significant association between years of experience and perceived risk, and between AI use and risk perception. The main risks identified are the difficulty in detecting false content and deepfakes, and the risk of obtaining inaccurate or erroneous data. Co-occurrence analysis shows that these risks are often perceived as interconnected. These findings highlight the complex and multifaceted concerns of journalists regarding AI's role in the information ecosystem.</description>

Abstract: Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is essential for enhancing situational awareness and preventing collisions. Still, existing data-driven models are constrained mainly to single-vessel forecasting, overlooking vessel interactions, navigation rules, and explicit collision risk assessment. We present a transformer-based framework for multi-vessel trajectory prediction with integrated collision risk analysis. For a given target vessel, the framework identifies nearby vessels. It jointly predicts their future trajectories through parallel streams encoding kinematic and derived physical features, causal convolutions for temporal locality, spatial transformations for positional encoding, and hybrid positional embeddings that capture both local motion patterns and long-range dependencies. Evaluated on large-scale real-world AIS data using joint multi-vessel metrics, the model demonstrates superior forecasting capabilities beyond traditional single-vessel displacement errors. By simulating interactions among predicted trajectories, the framework further quantifies potential collision risks, offering actionable insights to strengthen maritime safety and decision support.</description>

      <title>Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning for Data-Driven Maritime Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Routing vessels through narrow and dynamic waterways is challenging due to changing environmental conditions and operational constraints. Existing vessel-routing studies typically fail to generalize across multiple origin-destination pairs and do not exploit large-scale, data-driven traffic graphs. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning solution for big maritime data that can learn to find a route across multiple origin-destination pairs while adapting to different hexagonal grid resolutions. Agents learn to select direction and speed under continuous observations in a multi-discrete action space. A reward function balances fuel efficiency, travel time, wind resistance, and route diversity, using an Automatic Identification System (AIS)-derived traffic graph with ERA5 wind fields. The approach is demonstrated in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, one of the largest estuaries in the world. We evaluate configurations that combine Proximal Policy Optimization with recurrent networks, invalid-action masking, and exploration strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that action masking yields a clear improvement in policy performance and that supplementing penalty-only feedback with positive shaping rewards produces additional gains.</description>

      <title>HodgeFormer: Transformers for Learnable Operators on Triangular Meshes through Data-Driven Hodge Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, prominent Transformer architectures applied on graphs and meshes for shape analysis tasks employ traditional attention layers that heavily utilize spectral features requiring costly eigenvalue decomposition-based methods. To encode the mesh structure, these methods derive positional embeddings, that heavily rely on eigenvalue decomposition based operations, e.g. on the Laplacian matrix, or on heat-kernel signatures, which are then concatenated to the input features. This paper proposes a novel approach inspired by the explicit construction of the Hodge Laplacian operator in Discrete Exterior Calculus as a product of discrete Hodge operators and exterior derivatives, i.e. $(L := \star_0^{-1} d_0^T \star_1 d_0)$. We adjust the Transformer architecture in a novel deep learning layer that utilizes the multi-head attention mechanism to approximate Hodge matrices $\star_0$, $\star_1$ and $\star_2$ and learn families of discrete operators $L$ that act on mesh vertices, edges and faces. Our approach results in a computationally-efficient architecture that achieves comparable performance in mesh segmentation and classification tasks, through a direct learning framework, while eliminating the need for costly eigenvalue decomposition operations or complex preprocessing operations.</description>

      <title>GradES: Significantly Faster Training in Transformers with Gradient-Based Early Stopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early stopping monitors global validation loss and halts all parameter updates simultaneously, which is computationally costly for large transformers due to the extended time required for validation inference. We propose GradES, a novel gradient-based early stopping approach that operates within transformer components (attention projections and Feed-Forward layer matrices). We found that different components converge at varying rates during fine-tuning. GradES tracks the magnitude of gradients in backpropagation for these matrices during training. When a projection matrix's gradients fall below a convergence threshold $\tau$, we exclude that projection matrix from further updates individually, eliminating costly validation passes while allowing slow converging matrices to continue learning. By strategically freezing parameters when their gradients converge, GradES speeds up training time by 1.57--7.22$\times$ while simultaneously enhancing generalization through early prevention of overfitting, resulting in 1.2% higher average accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an overview of a human-centered initiative aimed at strengthening climate resilience along Nova Scotia's Eastern Shore. This region, a collection of rural villages with deep ties to the sea, faces existential threats from climate change that endanger its way of life. Our project moves beyond a purely technical response, weaving together expertise from Computer Science, Industrial Engineering, and Coastal Geography to co-create tools with the community. By integrating generational knowledge of residents, particularly elders, through the Eastern Shore Citizen Science Coastal Monitoring Network, this project aims to collaborate in building a living digital archive. This effort is hosted under Dalhousie University's Transforming Climate Action (TCA) initiative, specifically through its Transformative Adaptations to Social-Ecological Climate Change Trajectories (TranSECT) and TCA Artificial Intelligence (TCA-AI) projects. This work is driven by a collaboration model in which student teams work directly with residents. We present a detailed project timeline and a replicable model for how technology can support traditional communities, enabling them to navigate climate transformation more effectively.</description>

      <title>Doctoral Thesis: Geometric Deep Learning For Camera Pose Prediction, Registration, Depth Estimation, and 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern deep learning developments create new opportunities for 3D mapping technology, scene reconstruction pipelines, and virtual reality development. Despite advances in 3D deep learning technology, direct training of deep learning models on 3D data faces challenges due to the high dimensionality inherent in 3D data and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Structure-from-motion (SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) exhibit robust performance when applied to structured indoor environments but often struggle with ambiguous features in unstructured environments. These techniques often struggle to generate detailed geometric representations effective for downstream tasks such as rendering and semantic analysis. Current limitations require the development of 3D representation methods that combine traditional geometric techniques with deep learning capabilities to generate robust geometry-aware deep learning models.
  The dissertation provides solutions to the fundamental challenges in 3D vision by developing geometric deep learning methods tailored for essential tasks such as camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth prediction, and 3D reconstruction. The integration of geometric priors or constraints, such as including depth information, surface normals, and equivariance into deep learning models, enhances both the accuracy and robustness of geometric representations. This study systematically investigates key components of 3D vision, including camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth estimation, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction, demonstrating their effectiveness across real-world applications such as digital cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR environments.</description>

      <title>Preserving Bilinear Weight Spectra with a Signed and Shrunk Quadratic Activation Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of machine learning models is critical for ensuring their reliability and robustness. Whilst many techniques in mechanistic interpretability focus on activation driven analyses, being able to derive meaningful features directly from the weights of a neural network would provide greater guarantees and more computational efficiency. Existing techniques for analyzing model features through weights suffer from drawbacks such as reduced performance and data inefficiency. In this paper, we introduce Signed Quadratic Shrink (SQS), an activation function designed to allow Gated Linear Units (GLUs) to learn interpretable features without these drawbacks. Our experimental results show that SQS achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art activation functions whilst enabling weight-based interpretability</description>

      <title>HydroVision: Predicting Optically Active Parameters in Surface Water Using Computer Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ongoing advancements in computer vision, particularly in pattern recognition and scene classification, have enabled new applications in environmental monitoring. Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep learning-based scene classification framework that estimates optically active water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water. HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors, industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its operational utility.</description>

      <title>Extracting OPQRST in Electronic Health Records using Large Language Models with Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extraction of critical patient information from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) poses significant challenges due to the complexity and unstructured nature of the data. Traditional machine learning approaches often fail to capture pertinent details efficiently, making it difficult for clinicians to utilize these tools effectively in patient care. This paper introduces a novel approach to extracting the OPQRST assessment from EHRs by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose to reframe the task from sequence labeling to text generation, enabling the models to provide reasoning steps that mimic a physician's cognitive processes. This approach enhances interpretability and adapts to the limited availability of labeled data in healthcare settings. Furthermore, we address the challenge of evaluating the accuracy of machine-generated text in clinical contexts by proposing a modification to traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) metrics. This includes the integration of semantic similarity measures, such as the BERT Score, to assess the alignment between generated text and the clinical intent of the original records. Our contributions demonstrate a significant advancement in the use of AI in healthcare, offering a scalable solution that improves the accuracy and usability of information extraction from EHRs, thereby aiding clinicians in making more informed decisions and enhancing patient care outcomes.</description>

      <title>VISP: Volatility Informed Stochastic Projection for Adaptive Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose VISP: Volatility Informed Stochastic Projection, an adaptive regularization method that leverages gradient volatility to guide stochastic noise injection in deep neural networks. Unlike conventional techniques that apply uniform noise or fixed dropout rates, VISP dynamically computes volatility from gradient statistics and uses it to scale a stochastic projection matrix. This mechanism selectively regularizes inputs and hidden nodes that exhibit higher gradient volatility while preserving stable representations, thereby mitigating overfitting. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that VISP consistently improves generalization performance over baseline models and fixed-noise alternatives. In addition, detailed analyses of the evolution of volatility, the spectral properties of the projection matrix, and activation distributions reveal that VISP not only stabilizes the internal dynamics of the network but also fosters a more robust feature representation.</description>

      <title>Towards Interpretable Geo-localization: a Concept-Aware Global Image-GPS Alignment Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>A Continuous Encoding-Based Representation for Efficient Multi-Fidelity Multi-Objective Neural Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is an attractive approach to automate the design of optimized architectures but is constrained by high computational budget, especially when optimizing for multiple, important conflicting objectives. To address this, an adaptive Co-Kriging-assisted multi-fidelity multi-objective NAS algorithm is proposed to further reduce the computational cost of NAS by incorporating a clustering-based local multi-fidelity infill sampling strategy, enabling efficient exploration of the search space for faster convergence. This algorithm is further accelerated by the use of a novel continuous encoding method to represent the connections of nodes in each cell within a generalized cell-based U-Net backbone, thereby decreasing the search dimension (number of variables). Results indicate that the proposed NAS algorithm outperforms previously published state-of-the-art methods under limited computational budget on three numerical benchmarks, a 2D Darcy flow regression problem and a CHASE_DB1 biomedical image segmentation problem. The proposed method is subsequently used to create a wind velocity regression model with application in urban modelling, with the found model able to achieve good prediction with less computational complexity. Further analysis revealed that the NAS algorithm independently identified principles undergirding superior U-Net architectures in other literature, such as the importance of allowing each cell to incorporate information from prior cells.</description>

      <title>Structure-aware Contrastive Learning for Diagram Understanding of Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, have demonstrated remarkable success in aligning visual and linguistic representations. However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic information distinct from that of natural imagery.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models. Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.
  We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within the broader landscape of vision-language integration.</description>

      <title>2D Gaussian Splatting with Semantic Alignment for Image Inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality, establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image processing.</description>

      <title>Draw-In-Mind: Learning Precise Image Editing via Chain-of-Thought Imagination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i) DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale, DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1 and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits for image editing. Our dataset and models will be available at https://github.com/showlab/DIM.</description>

      <title>ACA-Net: Future Graph Learning for Logistical Demand-Supply Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Logistical demand-supply forecasting that evaluates the alignment between projected supply and anticipated demand, is essential for the efficiency and quality of on-demand food delivery platforms and serves as a key indicator for scheduling decisions. Future order distribution information, which reflects the distribution of orders in on-demand food delivery, is crucial for the performance of logistical demand-supply forecasting. Current studies utilize spatial-temporal analysis methods to model future order distribution information from serious time slices. However, learning future order distribution in online delivery platform is a time-series-insensitive problem with strong randomness. These approaches often struggle to effectively capture this information while remaining efficient. This paper proposes an innovative spatiotemporal learning model that utilizes only two graphs (ongoing and global) to learn future order distribution information, achieving superior performance compared to traditional spatial-temporal long-series methods. The main contributions are as follows: (1) The introduction of ongoing and global graphs in logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting compared to traditional long time series significantly enhances forecasting performance. (2) An innovative graph learning network framework using adaptive future graph learning and innovative cross attention mechanism (ACA-Net) is proposed to extract future order distribution information, effectively learning a robust future graph that substantially improves logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting outcomes. (3) The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in real-world production environments.</description>

      <title>Empowering Large Language Model for Sequential Recommendation via Multimodal Embeddings and Semantic IDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to capture users' dynamic interests and sequential patterns based on their historical interactions. Recently, the powerful capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have driven their adoption in SR. However, we identify two critical challenges in existing LLM-based SR methods: 1) embedding collapse when incorporating pre-trained collaborative embeddings and 2) catastrophic forgetting of quantized embeddings when utilizing semantic IDs. These issues dampen the model scalability and lead to suboptimal recommendation performance. Therefore, based on LLMs like Llama3-8B-instruct, we introduce a novel SR framework named MME-SID, which integrates multimodal embeddings and quantized embeddings to mitigate embedding collapse. Additionally, we propose a Multimodal Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MM-RQ-VAE) with maximum mean discrepancy as the reconstruction loss and contrastive learning for alignment, which effectively preserve intra-modal distance information and capture inter-modal correlations, respectively. To further alleviate catastrophic forgetting, we initialize the model with the trained multimodal code embeddings. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM efficiently using LoRA in a multimodal frequency-aware fusion manner. Extensive experiments on three public datasets validate the superior performance of MME-SID thanks to its capability to mitigate embedding collapse and catastrophic forgetting. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/MME-SID.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Training of Vision Transformers with Synthetic Negatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel method per se. Instead, we address the neglected potential of hard negative samples in self-supervised learning. Previous works explored synthetic hard negatives but rarely in the context of vision transformers. We build on this observation and integrate synthetic hard negatives to improve vision transformer representation learning. This simple yet effective technique notably improves the discriminative power of learned representations. Our experiments show performance improvements for both DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures.</description>

      <title>Fake &amp; Square: Training Self-Supervised Vision Transformers with Synthetic Data and Synthetic Hard Negatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper does not introduce a new method per se. Instead, we build on existing self-supervised learning approaches for vision, drawing inspiration from the adage "fake it till you make it". While contrastive self-supervised learning has achieved remarkable success, it typically relies on vast amounts of real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives. To explore alternatives to these requirements, we investigate two forms of "faking it" in vision transformers. First, we study the potential of generative models for unsupervised representation learning, leveraging synthetic data to augment sample diversity. Second, we examine the feasibility of generating synthetic hard negatives in the representation space, creating diverse and challenging contrasts. Our framework - dubbed Syn2Co - combines both approaches and evaluates whether synthetically enhanced training can lead to more robust and transferable visual representations on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures. Our findings highlight the promise and limitations of synthetic data in self-supervised learning, offering insights for future work in this direction.</description>

      <title>Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-Based Task-Driven MIMO System for Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To support cooperative perception (CP) of networked mobile agents in dynamic scenarios, the efficient and robust transmission of sensory data is a critical challenge. Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has demonstrated promising results for image transmission under adverse channel conditions, outperforming traditional rule-based codecs. While recent works have explored to combine JSCC with the widely adopted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology, these approaches are still limited to the discrete-time analog transmission (DTAT) model and simple tasks. Given the limited performance of existing MIMO JSCC schemes in supporting complex CP tasks for networked mobile agents with digital MIMO communication systems, this paper presents a Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-based task-driven MIMO system for image transmission, referred to as SoM-MIMO. By leveraging the structural properties of the feature pyramid for perceptual tasks and the channel properties of the closed-loop MIMO communication system, SoM-MIMO enables efficient and robust digital MIMO transmission of images. Experimental results have shown that compared with two JSCC baseline schemes, our approach achieves average mAP improvements of 6.30 and 10.48 across all SNR levels, while maintaining identical communication overhead.</description>

      <title>DeepSeek performs better than other Large Language Models in Dental Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold transformative potential in healthcare, yet their capacity to interpret longitudinal patient narratives remains inadequately explored. Dentistry, with its rich repository of structured clinical data, presents a unique opportunity to rigorously assess LLMs' reasoning abilities. While several commercial LLMs already exist, DeepSeek, a model that gained significant attention earlier this year, has also joined the competition. This study evaluated four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3) on their ability to analyze longitudinal dental case vignettes through open-ended clinical tasks. Using 34 standardized longitudinal periodontal cases (comprising 258 question-answer pairs), we assessed model performance via automated metrics and blinded evaluations by licensed dentists. DeepSeek emerged as the top performer, demonstrating superior faithfulness (median score = 0.528 vs. 0.367-0.457) and higher expert ratings (median = 4.5/5 vs. 4.0/5), without significantly compromising readability. Our study positions DeepSeek as the leading LLM for case analysis, endorses its integration as an adjunct tool in both medical education and research, and highlights its potential as a domain-specific agent.</description>

      <title>Fantastic Pretraining Optimizers and Where to Find Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AdamW has long been the dominant optimizer in language model pretraining, despite numerous claims that alternative optimizers offer 1.4 to 2x speedup. We posit that two methodological shortcomings have obscured fair comparisons and hindered practical adoption: (i) unequal hyperparameter tuning and (ii) limited or misleading evaluation setups. To address these two issues, we conduct a systematic study of ten deep learning optimizers across four model scales (0.1B-1.2B parameters) and data-to-model ratios (1-8x the Chinchilla optimum). We find that fair and informative comparisons require rigorous hyperparameter tuning and evaluations across a range of model scales and data-to-model ratios, performed at the end of training. First, optimal hyperparameters for one optimizer may be suboptimal for another, making blind hyperparameter transfer unfair. Second, the actual speedup of many proposed optimizers over well-tuned baselines is lower than claimed and decreases with model size to only 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models. Thirdly, comparing intermediate checkpoints before reaching the target training budgets can be misleading, as rankings between two optimizers can flip during training due to learning rate decay. Through our thorough investigation, we find that all the fastest optimizers such as Muon and Soap, use matrices as preconditioners -- multiplying gradients with matrices rather than entry-wise scalars. However, the speedup of matrix-based optimizers is inversely proportional to model scale, decreasing from 1.4x over AdamW for 0.1B parameter models to merely 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Utility Trade-off in Data Publication: A Bilevel Optimization Framework with Curvature-Guided Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models require datasets for effective training, but directly sharing raw data poses significant privacy risk such as membership inference attacks (MIA). To mitigate the risk, privacy-preserving techniques such as data perturbation, generalization, and synthetic data generation are commonly utilized. However, these methods often degrade data accuracy, specificity, and diversity, limiting the performance of downstream tasks and thus reducing data utility. Therefore, striking an optimal balance between privacy preservation and data utility remains a critical challenge.
  To address this issue, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization framework for the publication of private datasets, where the upper-level task focuses on data utility and the lower-level task focuses on data privacy. In the upper-level task, a discriminator guides the generation process to ensure that perturbed latent variables are mapped to high-quality samples, maintaining fidelity for downstream tasks. In the lower-level task, our framework employs local extrinsic curvature on the data manifold as a quantitative measure of individual vulnerability to MIA, providing a geometric foundation for targeted privacy protection. By perturbing samples toward low-curvature regions, our method effectively suppresses distinctive feature combinations that are vulnerable to MIA. Through alternating optimization of both objectives, we achieve a synergistic balance between privacy and utility. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method not only enhances resistance to MIA in downstream tasks but also surpasses existing methods in terms of sample quality and diversity.</description>

      <title>Align-Then-stEer: Adapting the Vision-Language Action Models through Unified Latent Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models pre-trained on large, diverse datasets show remarkable potential for general-purpose robotic manipulation. However, a primary bottleneck remains in adapting these models to downstream tasks, especially when the robot's embodiment or the task itself differs from the pre-training data. This discrepancy leads to a significant mismatch in action distributions, demanding extensive data and compute for effective fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{Align-Then-stEer (\texttt{ATE})}, a novel, data-efficient, and plug-and-play adaptation framework. \texttt{ATE} first aligns disparate action spaces by constructing a unified latent space, where a variational autoencoder constrained by reverse KL divergence embeds adaptation actions into modes of the pre-training action latent distribution. Subsequently, it steers the diffusion- or flow-based VLA's generation process during fine-tuning via a guidance mechanism that pushes the model's output distribution towards the target domain. We conduct extensive experiments on cross-embodiment and cross-task manipulation in both simulation and real world. Compared to direct fine-tuning of representative VLAs, our method improves the average multi-task success rate by up to \textbf{9.8\%} in simulation and achieves a striking \textbf{32\% success rate gain} in a real-world cross-embodiment setting. Our work presents a general and lightweight solution that greatly enhances the practicality of deploying VLA models to new robotic platforms and tasks.</description>

      <title>How Instruction-Tuning Imparts Length Control: A Cross-Lingual Mechanistic Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adhering to explicit length constraints, such as generating text with a precise word count, remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). This study aims at investigating the differences between foundation models and their instruction-tuned counterparts, on length-controlled text generation in English and Italian. We analyze both performance and internal component contributions using Cumulative Weighted Attribution, a metric derived from Direct Logit Attribution. Our findings reveal that instruction-tuning substantially improves length control, primarily by specializing components in deeper model layers. Specifically, attention heads in later layers of IT models show increasingly positive contributions, particularly in English. In Italian, while attention contributions are more attenuated, final-layer MLPs exhibit a stronger positive role, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. These results indicate that instruction-tuning reconfigures later layers for task adherence, with component-level strategies potentially adapting to linguistic context.</description>

Although several studies address forecasting DDoS attacks, they remain relatively limited compared to detection-focused research. By studying the current trends and forecasting based on newer and updated datasets, mitigation plans against the attacks can be planned and formulated. The methodology used in this research work conforms to the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) model.</description>

      <title>Better by Comparison: Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Reasoning for Automatic Prompt Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization has recently emerged as a strategy for improving the quality of prompts used in Large Language Models (LLMs), with the goal of generating more accurate and useful responses. However, most prior work focuses on direct prompt refinement or model fine-tuning, overlooking the potential of leveraging LLMs' inherent reasoning capability to learn from contrasting examples. In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a retrieval augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top k reference prompts from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open-source collection annotated for helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity, and constructs two complementary optimization paradigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning, where the LLM compares high, medium, and low quality prompts to refine its own generation through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best prompts along each evaluation dimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By explicitly contrasting high and low quality exemplars, CRPO enables the model to deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more robust and interpretable optimization. Experimental results on the HelpSteer2 benchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines. Our findings highlight the promise of contrastive, retrieval-augmented reasoning for advancing automatic prompt optimization.</description>

      <title>JudgeAgent: Dynamically Evaluate LLMs with Agent-as-Interviewer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is an essential step to ensure the successful application of LLMs across various domains. The current evaluation of LLMs is based on a paradigm that involves querying them with predefined question sets and assessing their outputs. This paradigm offers controllable processes and simplicity, but faces challenges such as limited interaction with targets, insufficient difficulty control, and difficulties in verifying the validity of evaluation results, making it hard to precisely determine the knowledge and capability boundaries of target models. To address these challenges, we propose JudgeAgent, a knowledge-target adaptive dynamic evaluation framework based on a new interviewer-style evaluation paradigm. JudgeAgent employs a comprehensive evaluation approach consisting of benchmark grading, interactive extension, and evaluation feedback. It utilizes knowledge-driven data synthesis and target-adaptive difficulty adjustment methods to conduct extended testing, providing accurate and effective evaluation results. We also introduce a novel insight into validating evaluation methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of JudgeAgent and its dynamic evaluation paradigm through extensive experiments.</description>

      <title>SALAD -- Semantics-Aware Logical Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies, such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

      <description>arXiv:2509.02113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of graph-based malware analysis is critically limited by the absence of large-scale datasets that capture the inherent hierarchical structure of software. Existing methods often oversimplify programs into single level graphs, failing to model the crucial semantic relationship between high-level functional interactions and low-level instruction logic. To bridge this gap, we introduce \dataset, the largest public hierarchical graph dataset for malware analysis, comprising over \textbf{200M} Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) nested within \textbf{595K} Function Call Graphs (FCGs). This two-level representation preserves structural semantics essential for building robust detectors resilient to code obfuscation and malware evolution. We demonstrate HiGraph's utility through a large-scale analysis that reveals distinct structural properties of benign and malicious software, establishing it as a foundational benchmark for the community. The dataset and tools are publicly available at https://higraph.org.</description>

      <title>Learning Social Heuristics for Human-Aware Path Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social robotic navigation has been at the center of numerous studies in recent years. Most of the research has focused on driving the robotic agent along obstacle-free trajectories, respecting social distances from humans, and predicting their movements to optimize navigation. However, in order to really be socially accepted, the robots must be able to attain certain social norms that cannot arise from conventional navigation, but require a dedicated learning process. We propose Heuristic Planning with Learned Social Value (HPLSV), a method to learn a value function encapsulating the cost of social navigation, and use it as an additional heuristic in heuristic-search path planning. In this preliminary work, we apply the methodology to the common social scenario of joining a queue of people, with the intention of generalizing to further human activities.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Framework of the Processes of Change in Psychotherapy Delivered by Artificial Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question of whether artificial agents (e.g., chatbots and social robots) can replace human therapists has received notable attention following the recent launch of large language models. However, little is known about the processes of change in psychotherapy delivered by artificial agents. To facilitate hypothesis development and stimulate scientific debate, the present article offers the first theoretical framework of the processes of change in psychotherapy delivered by artificial agents. The theoretical framework rests upon a conceptual analysis of what active ingredients may be inherently linked to the presence of human therapists. We propose that human therapists' ontological status as human beings and sociocultural status as socially sanctioned healthcare professionals play crucial roles in promoting treatment outcomes. In the absence of the ontological and sociocultural status of human therapists, we propose what we coin the genuineness gap and credibility gap can emerge and undermine key processes of change in psychotherapy. Based on these propositions, we propose avenues for scientific investigations and practical applications aimed at leveraging the strengths of artificial agents and human therapists respectively. We also highlight the intricate agentic nature of artificial agents and discuss how this complicates endeavors to establish universally applicable propositions regarding the processes of change in these interventions.</description>

      <title>Conditional-$t^3$VAE: Equitable Latent Space Allocation for Fair Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with global priors mirror the training set's class frequency in latent space, underrepresenting tail classes and reducing generative fairness on imbalanced datasets. While $t^3$VAE improves robustness via heavy-tailed Student's t-distribution priors, it still allocates latent volume proportionally to the class frequency.In this work, we address this issue by explicitly enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes. To this end, we propose Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which defines a per-class \mbox{Student's t} joint prior over latent and output variables, preventing dominance by majority classes. Our model is optimized using a closed-form objective derived from the $\gamma$-power divergence. Moreover, for class-balanced generation, we derive an equal-weight latent mixture of Student's t-distributions. On SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA, Conditional-$t^3$VAE consistently achieves lower FID scores than both $t^3$VAE and Gaussian-based VAE baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance. In per-class F1 evaluations, Conditional-$t^3$VAE also outperforms the conditional Gaussian VAE across all highly imbalanced settings. While Gaussian-based models remain competitive under mild imbalance ratio ($\rho \lesssim 3$), our approach substantially improves generative fairness and diversity in more extreme regimes.</description>

      <title>Meta-Pretraining for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Named Entity Recognition in Low-Resource Philippine Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) in low-resource languages is usually tackled by finetuning very large multilingual LMs, an option that is often infeasible in memory- or latency-constrained settings. We ask whether small decoder LMs can be pretrained so that they adapt quickly and transfer zero-shot to languages unseen during pretraining. To this end we replace part of the autoregressive objective with first-order model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). Tagalog and Cebuano are typologically similar yet structurally different in their actor/non-actor voice systems, and hence serve as a challenging test-bed. Across four model sizes (11 M - 570 M) MAML lifts zero-shot micro-F1 by 2-6 pp under head-only tuning and 1-3 pp after full tuning, while cutting convergence time by up to 8%. Gains are largest for single-token person entities that co-occur with Tagalog case particles si/ni, highlighting the importance of surface anchors.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Reliability in LLM-Integrated Robotic Systems: A Unified Approach to Security and Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has revolutionised embodied artificial intelligence, enabling advanced decision-making and adaptability. However, ensuring reliability, encompassing both security against adversarial attacks and safety in complex environments, remains a critical challenge. To address this, we propose a unified framework that mitigates prompt injection attacks while enforcing operational safety through robust validation mechanisms. Our approach combines prompt assembling, state management, and safety validation, evaluated using both performance and security metrics. Experiments show a 30.8% improvement under injection attacks and up to a 325% improvement in complex environment settings under adversarial conditions compared to baseline scenarios. This work bridges the gap between safety and security in LLM-based robotic systems, offering actionable insights for deploying reliable LLM-integrated mobile robots in real-world settings. The framework is open-sourced with simulation and physical deployment demos at https://llmeyesim.vercel.app/</description>

      <title>Avoidance Decoding for Diverse Multi-Branch Story Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate repetitive and monotonous outputs, especially in tasks like story generation, due to limited creative diversity when given the same input prompt. To address this challenge, we propose a novel decoding strategy, Avoidance Decoding, that modifies token logits by penalizing similarity to previously generated outputs, thereby encouraging more diverse multi-branch stories. This penalty adaptively balances two similarity measures: (1) Concept-level Similarity Penalty, which is prioritized in early stages to diversify initial story concepts, and (2) Narrative-level Similarity Penalty, which is increasingly emphasized later to ensure natural yet diverse plot development. Notably, our method achieves up to 2.6 times higher output diversity and reduces repetition by an average of 30% compared to strong baselines, while effectively mitigating text degeneration. Furthermore, we reveal that our method activates a broader range of neurons, demonstrating that it leverages the model's intrinsic creativity.</description>

      <title>Understanding Space Is Rocket Science - Only Top Reasoning Models Can Solve Spatial Understanding Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order of objects. The benchmark is designed
  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not object localization capabilities.

      <title>Beyond Ensembles: Simulating All-Atom Protein Dynamics in a Learned Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating the long-timescale dynamics of biomolecules is a central challenge in computational science. While enhanced sampling methods can accelerate these simulations, they rely on pre-defined collective variables that are often difficult to identify. A recent generative model, LD-FPG, demonstrated that this problem could be bypassed by learning to sample the static equilibrium ensemble as all-atom deformations from a reference structure, establishing a powerful method for all-atom ensemble generation. However, while this approach successfully captures a system's probable conformations, it does not model the temporal evolution between them. Here we extend LD-FPG with a temporal propagator that operates within the learned latent space and compare three classes: (i) score-guided Langevin dynamics, (ii) Koopman-based linear operators, and (iii) autoregressive neural networks. Within a unified encoder-propagator-decoder framework, we evaluate long-horizon stability, backbone and side-chain ensemble fidelity, and functional free-energy landscapes. Autoregressive neural networks deliver the most robust long rollouts; score-guided Langevin best recovers side-chain thermodynamics when the score is well learned; and Koopman provides an interpretable, lightweight baseline that tends to damp fluctuations. These results clarify the trade-offs among propagators and offer practical guidance for latent-space simulators of all-atom protein dynamics.</description>

      <title>Baichuan-M2: Scaling Medical Capability with Large Verifier System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance in conversational and reasoning capabilities, their practical application in healthcare has become a critical research focus. However, there is a notable gap between the performance of medical LLMs on static benchmarks such as USMLE and their utility in real-world clinical decision-making. This discrepancy arises because traditional exams fail to capture the dynamic, interactive nature of medical consultations. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel dynamic verification framework that moves beyond static answer verifier, establishing a large-scale, high-fidelity interactive reinforcement learning system. Our framework comprises two key components: a Patient Simulator that creates realistic clinical environments using de-identified medical records, and a Clinical Rubrics Generator that dynamically produces multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Building on this foundation, we develop Baichuan-M2, a 32B-parameter medical augmented reasoning model trained through a multi-stage reinforcement learning strategy with an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. Evaluated on HealthBench, Baichuan-M2 outperforms all other open-source models and most advanced closed-source counterparts, achieving a score above 32 on the challenging HealthBench Hard benchmark-previously exceeded only by GPT-5. Our work demonstrates that robust dynamic verifier system is essential for aligning LLM capabilities with practical clinical applications, establishing a new Pareto front in the performance-parameter trade-off for medical AI deployment.</description>

      <title>ST-Hyper: Learning High-Order Dependencies Across Multiple Spatial-Temporal Scales for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting, many deep learning based methods have been proposed for modeling dependencies at multiple spatial (inter-variate) or temporal (intra-variate) scales. However, existing methods may fail to model dependencies across multiple spatial-temporal scales (ST-scales, i.e., scales that jointly consider spatial and temporal scopes). In this work, we propose ST-Hyper to model the high-order dependencies across multiple ST-scales through adaptive hypergraph modeling. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Modeling (STPM) module to extract features at multiple ST-scales. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Hypergraph Modeling (AHM) module that learns a sparse hypergraph to capture robust high-order dependencies among features. In addition, we interact with these features through tri-phase hypergraph propagation, which can comprehensively capture multi-scale spatial-temporal dynamics. Experimental results on six real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that ST-Hyper achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baselines with an average MAE reduction of 3.8\% and 6.8\% for long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively.</description>

Abstract: News recommendations are complex, with diversity playing a vital role. So far, existing literature predominantly focuses on specific aspects of news diversity, such as viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce multi-aspect diversification in four distinct recommendation modes and outline the nuanced challenges in diversifying lists, sequences, summaries, and interactions. Our proposed research direction combines symbolic and subsymbolic artificial intelligence, leveraging both knowledge graphs and rule learning. We plan to evaluate our models using user studies to not only capture behavior but also their perceived experience. Our vision to balance news consumption points to other positive effects for users (e.g., increased serendipity) and society (e.g., decreased polarization).</description>

      <title>Application Of Large Language Models For The Extraction Of Information From Particle Accelerator Technical Documentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large set of technical documentation of legacy accelerator systems, coupled with the retirement of experienced personnel, underscores the urgent need for efficient methods to preserve and transfer specialized knowledge. This paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs), to automate and enhance the extraction of information from particle accelerator technical documents. By exploiting LLMs, we aim to address the challenges of knowledge retention, enabling the retrieval of domain expertise embedded in legacy documentation. We present initial results of adapting LLMs to this specialized domain. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in extracting, summarizing, and organizing knowledge, significantly reducing the risk of losing valuable insights as personnel retire. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of current LLMs, such as interpretability and handling of rare domain-specific terms, and propose strategies for improvement. This work highlights the potential of LLMs to play a pivotal role in preserving institutional knowledge and ensuring continuity in highly specialized fields.</description>

      <title>Autoencoder-based non-intrusive model order reduction in continuum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a non-intrusive, Autoencoder-based framework for reduced-order modeling in continuum mechanics. Our method integrates three stages: (i) an unsupervised Autoencoder compresses high-dimensional finite element solutions into a compact latent space, (ii) a supervised regression network maps problem parameters to latent codes, and (iii) an end-to-end surrogate reconstructs full-field solutions directly from input parameters.
  To overcome limitations of existing approaches, we propose two key extensions: a force-augmented variant that jointly predicts displacement fields and reaction forces at Neumann boundaries, and a multi-field architecture that enables coupled field predictions, such as in thermo-mechanical systems. The framework is validated on nonlinear benchmark problems involving heterogeneous composites, anisotropic elasticity with geometric variation, and thermo-mechanical coupling. Across all cases, it achieves accurate reconstructions of high-fidelity solutions while remaining fully non-intrusive.
  These results highlight the potential of combining deep learning with dimensionality reduction to build efficient and extensible surrogate models. Our publicly available implementation provides a foundation for integrating data-driven model order reduction into uncertainty quantification, optimization, and digital twin applications.</description>

      <title>VariAntNet: Learning Decentralized Control of Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple multi-agent system can be effectively utilized in disaster response applications, such as firefighting. Such a swarm is required to operate in complex environments with limited local sensing and no reliable inter-agent communication or centralized control. These simple robotic agents, also known as Ant Robots, are defined as anonymous agents that possess limited sensing capabilities, lack a shared coordinate system, and do not communicate explicitly with one another. A key challenge for simple swarms lies in maintaining cohesion and avoiding fragmentation despite limited-range sensing. Recent advances in machine learning offer effective solutions to some of the classical decentralized control challenges. We propose VariAntNet, a deep learning-based decentralized control model designed to facilitate agent swarming and collaborative task execution. VariAntNet includes geometric features extraction from unordered, variable-sized local observations. It incorporates a neural network architecture trained with a novel, differentiable, multi-objective, mathematically justified loss function that promotes swarm cohesiveness by utilizing the properties of the visibility graph Laplacian matrix. VariAntNet is demonstrated on the fundamental multi-agent gathering task, where agents with bearing-only and limited-range sensing must gather at some location. VariAntNet significantly outperforms an existing analytical solution, achieving more than double the convergence rate while maintaining high swarm connectivity across varying swarm sizes. While the analytical solution guarantees cohesion, it is often too slow in practice. In time-critical scenarios, such as emergency response operations where lives are at risk, slower analytical methods are impractical and justify the loss of some agents within the swarm. This paper presents and analyzes this trade-off in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present an analysis of technological and psychological factors of applying artificial intelligence (AI) at the work place. We do so for a number of twelve application cases in the context of a project where AI is integrated at work places and in work systems of the future. From a technological point of view we mainly look at the areas of AI that the applications are concerned with. This allows to formulate recommendations in terms of what to look at in developing an AI application and what to pay attention to with regards to building AI literacy with different stakeholders using the system. This includes the importance of high-quality data for training learning-based systems as well as the integration of human expertise, especially with knowledge-based systems. In terms of the psychological factors we derive research questions to investigate in the development of AI supported work systems and to consider in future work, mainly concerned with topics such as acceptance, openness, and trust in an AI system.</description>

      <title>Think2Sing: Orchestrating Structured Motion Subtitles for Singing-Driven 3D Head Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singing-driven 3D head animation is a challenging yet promising task with applications in virtual avatars, entertainment, and education. Unlike speech, singing involves richer emotional nuance, dynamic prosody, and lyric-based semantics, requiring the synthesis of fine-grained, temporally coherent facial motion. Existing speech-driven approaches often produce oversimplified, emotionally flat, and semantically inconsistent results, which are insufficient for singing animation. To address this, we propose Think2Sing, a diffusion-based framework that leverages pretrained large language models to generate semantically coherent and temporally consistent 3D head animations, conditioned on both lyrics and acoustics. A key innovation is the introduction of motion subtitles, an auxiliary semantic representation derived through a novel Singing Chain-of-Thought reasoning process combined with acoustic-guided retrieval. These subtitles contain precise timestamps and region-specific motion descriptions, serving as interpretable motion priors. We frame the task as a motion intensity prediction problem, enabling finer control over facial regions and improving the modeling of expressive motion. To support this, we create a multimodal singing dataset with synchronized video, acoustic descriptors, and motion subtitles, enabling diverse and expressive motion learning. Extensive experiments show that Think2Sing outperforms state-of-the-art methods in realism, expressiveness, and emotional fidelity, while also offering flexible, user-controllable animation editing.</description>

      <title>ReCode: Improving LLM-based Code Repair with Fine-Grained Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in code-related tasks, such as code generation and automated program repair. Despite their promising performance, most existing approaches for code repair suffer from high training costs or computationally expensive inference. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), with its efficient in-context learning paradigm, offers a more scalable alternative. However, conventional retrieval strategies, which are often based on holistic code-text embeddings, fail to capture the structural intricacies of code, resulting in suboptimal retrieval quality. To address the above limitations, we propose ReCode, a fine-grained retrieval-augmented in-context learning framework designed for accurate and efficient code repair. Specifically, ReCode introduces two key innovations: (1) an algorithm-aware retrieval strategy that narrows the search space using preliminary algorithm type predictions; and (2) a modular dual-encoder architecture that separately processes code and textual inputs, enabling fine-grained semantic matching between input and retrieved contexts. Furthermore, we propose RACodeBench, a new benchmark constructed from real-world user-submitted buggy code, which addresses the limitations of synthetic benchmarks and supports realistic evaluation. Experimental results on RACodeBench and competitive programming datasets demonstrate that ReCode achieves higher repair accuracy with significantly reduced inference cost, highlighting its practical value for real-world code repair scenarios.</description>

      <title>DCPO: Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards, which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization (DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that adaptively adjusts the clipping bounds based on token-specific prior probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24 benchmark, surpassing both DAPO (36.7/31.6) and GRPO (36.7/32.1) on the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5) and DAPO (20.0/15.3). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance. These results highlight DCPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data more efficiently for reinforcement learning in large language models.</description>

      <title>RDIT: Residual-based Diffusion Implicit Models for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a critical role in domains requiring accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions for decision-making. However, existing methods offer suboptimal distribution modeling and suffer from a mismatch between training and evaluation metrics. Surprisingly, we found that augmenting a strong point estimator with a zero-mean Gaussian, whose standard deviation matches its training error, can yield state-of-the-art performance in PTSF. In this work, we propose RDIT, a plug-and-play framework that combines point estimation and residual-based conditional diffusion with a bidirectional Mamba network. We theoretically prove that the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) can be minimized by adjusting to an optimal standard deviation and then derive algorithms to achieve distribution matching. Evaluations on eight multivariate datasets across varied forecasting horizons demonstrate that RDIT achieves lower CRPS, rapid inference, and improved coverage compared to strong baselines.</description>

      <title>AudioCodecBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Audio Codec Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied in speech and music. This tendency has led to a focus on audio tokenization for Large Models (LMs). Unlike semantic-only text tokens, audio tokens must both capture global semantic content and preserve fine-grained acoustic details. Moreover, they provide a discrete method for speech and music that can be effectively integrated into MLLMs. However, existing research is unsuitable in the definitions of semantic tokens and acoustic tokens. In addition, the evaluation of different codecs typically concentrates on specific domains or tasks, such as reconstruction or Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) task, which prevents fair and comprehensive comparisons. To address these problems, this paper provides suitable definitions for semantic and acoustic tokens and introduces a systematic evaluation framework. This framework allows for a comprehensive assessment of codecs' capabilities which evaluate across four dimensions: audio reconstruction metric, codebook index (ID) stability, decoder-only transformer perplexity, and performance on downstream probe tasks. Our results show the correctness of the provided suitable definitions and the correlation among reconstruction metrics, codebook ID stability, downstream probe tasks and perplexity.</description>

      <title>Implicit Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across a wide range of tasks. Reasoning with LLMs is central to solving multi-step problems and complex decision-making. To support efficient reasoning, recent studies have shifted attention from explicit chain-of-thought prompting toward implicit reasoning, where reasoning occurs silently via latent structures without emitting intermediate textual steps. Implicit reasoning brings advantages such as lower generation cost, faster inference, and better alignment with internal computation. Although prior surveys have discussed latent representations in the context of reasoning, a dedicated and mechanism-level examination of how reasoning unfolds internally within LLMs remains absent. This survey fills that gap by introducing a taxonomy centered on execution paradigms, shifting the focus from representational forms to computational strategies. We organize existing methods into three execution paradigms based on \textbf{\textit{how and where internal computation unfolds}}: latent optimization, signal-guided control, and layer-recurrent execution. We also review structural, behavioral and representation-based evidence that supports the presence of implicit reasoning in LLMs. We further provide a structured overview of the evaluation metrics and benchmarks used in existing works to assess the effectiveness and reliability of implicit reasoning.We maintain a continuously updated project at: https://github.com/digailab/awesome-llm-implicit-reasoning.</description>

      <title>Ordinal Adaptive Correction: A Data-Centric Approach to Ordinal Image Classification with Noisy Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience) and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions (ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance. For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to 0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of noisy data.</description>

      <title>Guidance and Control Neural Network Acceleration using Memristors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the space community has been exploring the possibilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), for a variety of on board applications. However, this development is limited by the restricted energy budget of smallsats and cubesats as well as radiation concerns plaguing modern chips. This necessitates research into neural network accelerators capable of meeting these requirements whilst satisfying the compute and performance needs of the application. This paper explores the use of Phase-Change Memory (PCM) and Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM) memristors for on-board in-memory computing AI acceleration in space applications. A guidance and control neural network (G\&amp;CNET) accelerated using memristors is simulated in a variety of scenarios and with both device types to evaluate the performance of memristor-based accelerators, considering device non-idealities such as noise and conductance drift. We show that the memristive accelerator is able to learn the expert actions, though challenges remain with the impact of noise on accuracy. We also show that re-training after degradation is able to restore performance to nominal levels. This study provides a foundation for future research into memristor-based AI accelerators for space, highlighting their potential and the need for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Poisoned at Scale: A Scalable Audit Uncovers Hidden Scam Endpoints in Production LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become critical to modern software development, but their reliance on internet datasets for training introduces a significant security risk: the absorption and reproduction of malicious content. To evaluate this threat, this paper introduces a scalable, automated audit framework that synthesizes innocuous, developer-style prompts from known scam databases to query production LLMs and determine if they generate code containing harmful URLs. We conducted a large-scale evaluation across four production LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Scout, and DeepSeek-V3), and found a systemic vulnerability, with all tested models generating malicious code at a non-negligible rate. On average, 4.2\% of programs generated in our experiments contained malicious URLs. Crucially, this malicious code is often generated in response to benign prompts. We manually validate the prompts which cause all four LLMs to generate malicious code, and resulting in 177 innocuous prompts that trigger all models to produce harmful outputs. These results provide strong empirical evidence that the training data of production LLMs has been successfully poisoned at scale, underscoring the urgent need for more robust defense mechanisms and post-generation safety checks to mitigate the propagation of hidden security threats.</description>

Abstract: The growing use of FPGAs in reconfigurable systems introducessecurity risks through malicious bitstreams that could cause denial-of-service (DoS), data leakage, or covert attacks. We investigated chip-level hardware malicious payload in embedded systems and proposed a supervised machine learning method to detect malicious bitstreams via static byte-level features. Our approach diverges from existing methods by analyzing bitstreams directly at the binary level, enabling real-time detection without requiring access to source code or netlists. Bitstreams were sourced from state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks and re-engineered to target the Xilinx PYNQ-Z1 FPGA Development Board. Our dataset included 122 samples of benign and malicious configurations. The data were vectorized using byte frequency analysis, compressed using TSVD, and balanced using SMOTE to address class imbalance. The evaluated classifiers demonstrated that Random Forest achieved a macro F1-score of 0.97, underscoring the viability of real-time Trojan detection on resource-constrained systems. The final model was serialized and successfully deployed via PYNQ to enable integrated bitstream analysis.</description>

Abstract: Mobile Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing diverse fields such as healthcare, finance, and education with their ability to perform advanced natural language processing tasks on-the-go. However, the deployment of these models in mobile and edge environments introduces significant challenges related to privacy and security due to their resource-intensive nature and the sensitivity of the data they process. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of privacy and security issues associated with mobile LLMs, systematically categorizing existing solutions such as differential privacy, federated learning, and prompt encryption. Furthermore, we analyze vulnerabilities unique to mobile LLMs, including adversarial attacks, membership inference, and side-channel attacks, offering an in-depth comparison of their effectiveness and limitations. Despite recent advancements, mobile LLMs face unique hurdles in achieving robust security while maintaining efficiency in resource-constrained environments. To bridge this gap, we propose potential applications, discuss open challenges, and suggest future research directions, paving the way for the development of trustworthy, privacy-compliant, and scalable mobile LLM systems.</description>

      <title>From Noisy Labels to Intrinsic Structure: A Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Framework for Noise-Robust Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in medical image segmentation relies on large-scale, high-quality annotations, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain noise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature learning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges, this study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which integrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy annotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening supervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided Label Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to local details. To comprehensively assess its effectiveness, we evaluated GSD-Net on six publicly available datasets: four containing three types of simulated label noise, and two with multi-expert annotations that reflect real-world subjectivity and labeling inconsistencies. Experimental results demonstrate that GSD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance under noisy annotations, achieving improvements of 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen, 8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise.

      <title>Do LLMs Adhere to Label Definitions? Examining Their Receptivity to External Label Definitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Do LLMs genuinely incorporate external definitions, or do they primarily rely on their parametric knowledge? To address these questions, we conduct controlled experiments across multiple explanation benchmark datasets (general and domain-specific) and label definition conditions, including expert-curated, LLM-generated, perturbed, and swapped definitions. Our results reveal that while explicit label definitions can enhance accuracy and explainability, their integration into an LLM's task-solving processes is neither guaranteed nor consistent, suggesting reliance on internalized representations in many cases. Models often default to their internal representations, particularly in general tasks, whereas domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions. These findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of how LLMs process external knowledge alongside their pre-existing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Generative Sequential Notification Optimization via Multi-Objective Decision Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Notifications are an important communication channel for delivering timely and relevant information. Optimizing their delivery involves addressing complex sequential decision-making challenges under constraints such as message utility and user fatigue. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), have been applied to this problem but face practical challenges at scale, including instability, sensitivity to distribution shifts, limited reproducibility, and difficulties with explainability in high-dimensional recommendation settings. We present a Decision Transformer (DT) based framework that reframes policy learning as return-conditioned supervised learning, improving robustness, scalability, and modeling flexibility. Our contributions include a real-world comparison with CQL, a multi-reward design suitable for non-episodic tasks, a quantile regression approach to return-to-go conditioning, and a production-ready system with circular buffer-based sequence processing for near-real-time inference. Extensive offline and online experiments in a deployed notification system show that our approach improves notification utility and overall session activity while minimizing user fatigue. Compared to a multi-objective CQL-based agent, the DT-based approach achieved a +0.72% increase in sessions for notification decision-making at LinkedIn by making notification recommendation more relevant.</description>

      <title>MLP-Offload: Multi-Level, Multi-Path Offloading for LLM Pre-training to Break the GPU Memory Wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training LLMs larger than the aggregated memory of multiple GPUs is increasingly necessary due to the faster growth of LLM sizes compared to GPU memory. To this end, multi-tier host memory or disk offloading techniques are proposed by state of art. Despite advanced asynchronous multi-tier read/write strategies, such offloading strategies result in significant I/O overheads in the critical path of training, resulting in slower iterations. To this end, we propose MLP-Offload, a novel multi-level, multi-path offloading engine specifically designed for optimizing LLM training on resource-constrained setups by mitigating I/O bottlenecks. We make several key observations that drive the design of MLP-Offload, such as I/O overheads during the update dominate the iteration time; I/O bandwidth of the third-level remote storage tier remains unutilized; and, contention due to concurrent offloading amplifies I/O bottlenecks. Driven by these insights, we design and implement MLP-Offload to offload the optimizer states across multiple tiers in a cache-efficient and concurrency-controlled fashion to mitigate I/O bottlenecks during the backward and update phases. Evaluations on models up to 280B parameters shows that MLP-Offload achieves 2.5$\times$ faster iterations compared to the state-of-the-art LLM training runtimes.</description>

      <title>Probabilistically stable revision and comparative probability: a representation theorem and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability rule for belief, advocated by Leitgeb [Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 164, 2013], is a rule for rational acceptance that captures categorical belief in terms of $\textit{probabilistically stable propositions}$: propositions to which the agent assigns resiliently high credence. The stability rule generates a class of $\textit{probabilistically stable belief revision}$ operators, which capture the dynamics of belief that result from an agent updating their credences through Bayesian conditioning while complying with the stability rule for their all-or-nothing beliefs. In this paper, we prove a representation theorem that yields a complete characterisation of such probabilistically stable revision operators and provides a `qualitative' selection function semantics for the (non-monotonic) logic of probabilistically stable belief revision. Drawing on the theory of comparative probability orders, this result gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a selection function to be representable as a strongest-stable-set operator on a finite probability space. The resulting logic of probabilistically stable belief revision exhibits strong monotonicity properties while failing the AGM belief revision postulates and satisfying only very weak forms of case reasoning. In showing the main theorem, we prove two results of independent interest to the theory of comparative probability: the first provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the joint representation of a pair of (respectively, strict and non-strict) comparative probability orders. The second result provides a method for axiomatising the logic of ratio comparisons of the form ``event $A$ is at least $k$ times more likely than event $B$''. In addition to these measurement-theoretic applications, we point out two applications of our main result to the theory of simple voting games and to revealed preference theory.</description>

      <title>MoSEs: Uncertainty-Aware AI-Generated Text Detection via Mixture of Stylistics Experts with Conditional Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has intensified public concerns about the potential misuse. Therefore, it is important to build trustworthy AI-generated text detection systems. Existing methods neglect stylistic modeling and mostly rely on static thresholds, which greatly limits the detection performance. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of Stylistic Experts (MoSEs) framework that enables stylistics-aware uncertainty quantification through conditional threshold estimation. MoSEs contain three core components, namely, the Stylistics Reference Repository (SRR), the Stylistics-Aware Router (SAR), and the Conditional Threshold Estimator (CTE). For input text, SRR can activate the appropriate reference data in SRR and provide them to CTE. Subsequently, CTE jointly models the linguistic statistical properties and semantic features to dynamically determine the optimal threshold. With a discrimination score, MoSEs yields prediction labels with the corresponding confidence level. Our framework achieves an average improvement 11.34% in detection performance compared to baselines. More inspiringly, MoSEs shows a more evident improvement 39.15% in the low-resource case. Our code is available at https://github.com/creator-xi/MoSEs.</description>

      <title>Top-H Decoding: Adapting the Creativity and Coherence with Bounded Entropy in Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, often struggle to balance two competing objectives in open-ended text generation: fostering diversity and creativity while preserving logical coherence. Existing truncated sampling techniques, including temperature scaling, top-\$p\$ (nucleus) sampling, and min-\$p\$ sampling, aim to manage this trade-off. However, they exhibit limitations, particularly in the effective incorporation of the confidence of the model into the corresponding sampling strategy. For example, min-\$p\$ sampling relies on a single top token as a heuristic for confidence, eventually underutilizing the information of the probability distribution. Toward effective incorporation of the confidence of the model, in this paper, we present **top-H** decoding. We first establish the theoretical foundation of the interplay between creativity and coherence in truncated sampling by formulating an **entropy-constrained minimum divergence** problem. We then prove this minimization problem to be equivalent to an **entropy-constrained mass maximization** (ECMM) problem, which is NP-hard. Finally, we present top-H decoding, a computationally efficient greedy algorithm to solve the ECMM problem. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that top-H outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA) alternative of min-\$p\$ sampling by up to **25.63%** on creative writing benchmarks, while maintaining robustness on question-answering datasets such as GPQA, GSM8K, and MT-Bench. Additionally, an *LLM-as-judge* evaluation confirms that top-H indeed produces coherent outputs even at higher temperatures, where creativity is especially critical. In summary, top-H advances SoTA in open-ended text generation and can be *easily integrated* into creative writing applications. The code is available at https://github.com/ErfanBaghaei/Top-H-Decoding.</description>

      <title>FLM-Audio: Natural Monologues Improves Native Full-Duplex Chatbots via Dual Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full-duplex dialog models are designed to listen and speak simultaneously with rapid responses to fast-changing user input. Among existing approaches, native full-duplex models merges different channels (e.g. listen and speak) in a single time step, overcoming the high response latency inherent to time-division multiplexing time-division multiplexing (TDM) alternatives. Yet, a key challenge remains: aligning textual monologues with audio streams that operate at different bitrates. The prevailing solution relies on word-level alignment, but this can degrade the language ability of large pre-trained models. Moreover, it requires highly accurate timestamps for every token, which introduces cascading errors and increases pre-processing costs. In this paper, we propose textual monologues in continuous tokens sequence, namely "natural" monologues, which mimics humanoid cognitive behavior in dialogs. For temporal alignment, we alternate the position of the natural monologue - leading or trailing the audio - across different training stages. This "dual" training paradigm proves highly effective in building FLM-Audio, our 7B spoken dialog model that demonstrates superior responsiveness, duplexity, and chatting experiences, as confirmed by experimental results.</description>

      <title>Manipulation as in Simulation: Enabling Accurate Geometry Perception in Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern robotic manipulation primarily relies on visual observations in a 2D color space for skill learning but suffers from poor generalization. In contrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such as distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects. Since such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth cameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual capabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation is challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to various types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as a simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth signals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this, we develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from simulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that CDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively bridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments demonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth, without the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes seamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving articulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance degradation. We hope our findings will inspire future research in utilizing simulation data and 3D information in general robot policies.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Benchmarks for Model Merging Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model merging techniques aim to integrate the abilities of multiple models into a single model. Most model merging techniques have hyperparameters, and their setting affects the performance of the merged model. Because several existing works show that tuning hyperparameters in model merging can enhance the merging outcome, developing hyperparameter optimization algorithms for model merging is a promising direction. However, its optimization process is computationally expensive, particularly in merging LLMs. In this work, we develop surrogate benchmarks for optimization of the merging hyperparameters to realize algorithm development and performance comparison at low cost. We define two search spaces and collect data samples to construct surrogate models to predict the performance of a merged model from a hyperparameter. We demonstrate that our benchmarks can predict the performance of merged models well and simulate optimization algorithm behaviors.</description>

      <title>Probability Bracket Notation: Multivariable Systems and Static Bayesian Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.5293</link>
      <description>arXiv:1207.5293v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We expand the Probability Bracket Notation (PBN), a symbolic framework inspired by the Dirac notation in quantum mechanics, to multivariable probability systems and static Bayesian networks (BNs). By introducing PBN for joint, marginal, and conditional probability distributions (PDs), as well as marginal and conditional expectations, we demonstrate how to express dependencies among multiple random variables concisely and manipulate them algebraically. Using the well-known Student BN as an example of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), we show how to apply PBN to analyze predictions, inferences (using both bottom-up and top-down approaches), and expectations. We also extend PBN to BNs with continuous variables. After reviewing linear Gaussian networks, we introduce a customized Healthcare BN that includes both continuous and discrete random variables, utilizes user-specific data, and provides tailored predictions through discrete-display (DD) nodes as proxies for their continuous variable parents. Compared to traditional probability notation, PBN offers a unifying operator-like framework that simplifies the analysis of probabilistic models. This work highlights the potential of PBN as both an educational tool and a practical framework for probabilistic modeling, paving the way for applications in causal reasoning, inferences, expectations, data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2002.03531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite rapid gains in scale, research evaluation still relies on opaque, lagging proxies. To serve the scientific community, we pursue transparency: reproducible, auditable epistemic classification useful for funding and policy. Here we formalize KGX3 as a scenario-based model for mapping Kuhnian stages from research papers, prove determinism of the classification pipeline, and define the epistemic manifold that yields paradigm maps. We report validation across recent corpora, operational complexity at global scale, and governance that preserves interpretability while protecting core IP. The system delivers early, actionable signals of drift, crisis, and shift unavailable to citation metrics or citations-anchored NLP. KGX3 is the latest iteration of a deterministic epistemic engine developed since 2019, originating as Soph.io (2020), advanced as iKuhn (2024), and field-tested through Preprint Watch in 2025.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis Network Planned Exploration for Rapid Meta-Reinforcement Learning Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL) learns optimal policies across a series of related tasks. A central challenge in Meta-RL is rapidly identifying which previously learned task is most similar to a new one, in order to adapt to it quickly. Prior approaches, despite significant success, typically rely on passive exploration strategies such as periods of random action to characterize the new task in relation to the learned ones. While sufficient when tasks are clearly distinguishable, passive exploration limits adaptation speed when informative transitions are rare or revealed only by specific behaviors. We introduce Hypothesis-Planned Exploration (HyPE), a method that actively plans sequences of actions during adaptation to efficiently identify the most similar previously learned task. HyPE operates within a joint latent space, where state-action transitions from different tasks form distinct paths. This latent-space planning approach enables HyPE to serve as a drop-in improvement for most model-based Meta-RL algorithms. By using planned exploration, HyPE achieves exponentially lower failure probability compared to passive strategies when informative transitions are sparse. On a natural language Alchemy game, HyPE identified the closest task in 65-75% of trials, far outperforming the 18-28% passive exploration baseline, and yielding up to 4x more successful adaptations under the same sample budget.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient LLM Grounding for Embodied Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grounding the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) for embodied tasks is challenging due to the complexity of the physical world. Especially, LLM planning for multi-agent collaboration requires communication of agents or credit assignment as the feedback to re-adjust the proposed plans and achieve effective coordination. However, existing methods that overly rely on physical verification or self-reflection suffer from excessive and inefficient querying of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multi-agent collaboration that introduces Reinforced Advantage feedback (ReAd) for efficient self-refinement of plans. Specifically, we perform critic regression to learn a sequential advantage function from LLM-planned data, and then treat the LLM planner as an optimizer to generate actions that maximize the advantage function. It endows the LLM with the foresight to discern whether the action contributes to accomplishing the final task. We provide theoretical analysis by extending advantage-weighted regression in reinforcement learning to multi-agent systems. Experiments on Overcooked-AI and a difficult variant of RoCoBench show that ReAd surpasses baselines in success rate, and also significantly decreases the interaction steps of agents and query rounds of LLMs, demonstrating its high efficiency for grounding LLMs. More results are given at https://read-llm.github.io.</description>

While communication helps, it is not always feasible. In this paper, we explore how effective coordination can be achieved without verbal communication, relying solely on observing each other's actions. Our method enables an agent to develop a strategy by interpreting its partner's action sequences as intent signals, constructing a finite-state transducer built from deterministic finite automata, one for each possible action the agent can take. Experiments show that these strategies significantly outperform uncoordinated ones and closely match the performance of coordinating via direct communication.</description>

      <title>HAICOSYSTEM: An Ecosystem for Sandboxing Safety Risks in Human-AI Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16427v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI agents are increasingly autonomous in their interactions with human users and tools, leading to increased interactional safety risks. We present HAICOSYSTEM, a framework examining AI agent safety within diverse and complex social interactions. HAICOSYSTEM features a modular sandbox environment that simulates multi-turn interactions between human users and AI agents, where the AI agents are equipped with a variety of tools (e.g., patient management platforms) to navigate diverse scenarios (e.g., a user attempting to access other patients' profiles). To examine the safety of AI agents in these interactions, we develop a comprehensive multi-dimensional evaluation framework that uses metrics covering operational, content-related, societal, and legal risks. Through running 1840 simulations based on 92 scenarios across seven domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, education), we demonstrate that HAICOSYSTEM can emulate realistic user-AI interactions and complex tool use by AI agents. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs, both proprietary and open-sourced, exhibit safety risks in over 50\% cases, with models generally showing higher risks when interacting with simulated malicious users. Our findings highlight the ongoing challenge of building agents that can safely navigate complex interactions, particularly when faced with malicious users. To foster the AI agent safety ecosystem, we release a code platform that allows practitioners to create custom scenarios, simulate interactions, and evaluate the safety and performance of their agents.</description>

      <title>From Anchors to Answers: A Novel Node Tokenizer for Integrating Graph Structure into Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enabling large language models (LLMs) to effectively process and reason with graph-structured data remains a significant challenge despite their remarkable success in natural language tasks. Current approaches either convert graph structures into verbose textual descriptions, consuming substantial computational resources, or employ complex graph neural networks as tokenizers, which introduce significant training overhead. To bridge this gap, we present NT-LLM, a novel framework with an anchor-based positional encoding scheme for graph representation. Our approach strategically selects reference nodes as anchors and encodes each node's position relative to these anchors, capturing essential topological information without the computational burden of existing methods. Notably, we identify and address a fundamental issue: the inherent misalignment between discrete hop-based distances in graphs and continuous distances in embedding spaces. By implementing a rank-preserving objective for positional encoding pretraining, NT-LLM achieves superior performance across diverse graph tasks ranging from basic structural analysis to complex reasoning scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that this lightweight yet powerful approach effectively enhances LLMs' ability to understand and reason with graph-structured information, offering an efficient solution for graph-based applications of language models.</description>

      <title>Understanding Impact of Human Feedback via Influence Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05790v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), it is crucial to learn suitable reward models from human feedback to align large language models (LLMs) with human intentions. However, human feedback can often be noisy, inconsistent, or biased, especially when evaluating complex responses. Such feedback can lead to misaligned reward signals, potentially causing unintended side effects during the RLHF process. To address these challenges, we explore the use of influence functions to measure the impact of human feedback on the performance of reward models. We propose a compute-efficient approximation method that enables the application of influence functions to LLM-based reward models and large-scale preference datasets. Our experiments showcase two key applications of influence functions: (1) detecting common labeler biases in human feedback datasets and (2) guiding labelers in refining their strategies to better align with expert feedback. By quantifying the impact of human feedback, we believe that influence functions can enhance feedback interpretability and contribute to scalable oversight in RLHF, helping labelers provide more accurate and consistent feedback.

      <title>Optimization of Link Configuration for Satellite Communication Using Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Satellite communication is a key technology in our modern connected world. With increasingly complex hardware, one challenge is to efficiently configure links (connections) on a satellite transponder. Planning an optimal link configuration is extremely complex and depends on many parameters and metrics. The optimal use of the limited resources, bandwidth and power of the transponder is crucial. Such an optimization problem can be approximated using metaheuristic methods such as simulated annealing, but recent research results also show that reinforcement learning can achieve comparable or even better performance in optimization methods. However, there have not yet been any studies on link configuration on satellite transponders. In order to close this research gap, a transponder environment was developed as part of this work. For this environment, the performance of the reinforcement learning algorithm PPO was compared with the metaheuristic simulated annealing in two experiments. The results show that Simulated Annealing delivers better results for this static problem than the PPO algorithm, however, the research in turn also underlines the potential of reinforcement learning for optimization problems.</description>

      <title>SETS: Leveraging Self-Verification and Self-Correction for Improved Test-Time Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19306v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have created new opportunities to enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks by leveraging test-time computation. However, existing scaling methods have key limitations: parallel methods like repeated sampling are often inefficient and quickly saturate, while sequential methods like SELF-REFINE struggle to improve after a few rounds. Although combining these approaches shows promise, current methods require fine-tuned reward and revision models. This paper proposes Self-Enhanced Test-Time Scaling (SETS), a simple yet effective approach that overcomes these limitations by strategically combining parallel and sequential techniques and fully leveraging LLMs' self-improvement abilities. SETS exploits the inherent self-verification and self-correction capabilities of LLMs, unifying sampling, verification, and correction within a single framework. This facilitates efficient and scalable test-time computation for enhanced performance on complex tasks without any model training. Our comprehensive experimental results on challenging benchmarks spanning planning, reasoning, math, and coding demonstrate that SETS achieves significant performance improvements and more advantageous test-time scaling behavior than the alternatives.</description>

      <title>Competing LLM Agents in a Non-Cooperative Game of Opinion Polarisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel non-cooperative game to analyse opinion formation and resistance, incorporating principles from social psychology such as confirmation bias, resource constraints, and influence penalties. Our simulation features Large Language Model (LLM) agents competing to influence a population, with penalties imposed for generating messages that propagate or counter misinformation. This framework integrates resource optimisation into the agents' decision-making process. Our findings demonstrate that while higher confirmation bias strengthens opinion alignment within groups, it also exacerbates overall polarisation. Conversely, lower confirmation bias leads to fragmented opinions and limited shifts in individual beliefs. Investing heavily in a high-resource debunking strategy can initially align the population with the debunking agent, but risks rapid resource depletion and diminished long-term influence</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel technique for constructing differentiable order-type operations, including soft ranking, soft top-k selection, and soft permutations. Our approach leverages an efficient closed-form formula for the inverse of the function LapSum, defined as the sum of Laplace distributions. This formulation ensures low computational and memory complexity in selecting the highest activations, enabling losses and gradients to be computed in $O(n\log{}n)$ time. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for high-dimensional vectors and large $k$ values. Furthermore, we provide efficient implementations for both CPU and CUDA environments, underscoring the practicality and scalability of our method for large-scale ranking and differentiable ordering problems.</description>

      <title>Perspective-Shifted Neuro-Symbolic World Models: A Framework for Socially-Aware Robot Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Navigating in environments alongside humans requires agents to reason under uncertainty and account for the beliefs and intentions of those around them. Under a sequential decision-making framework, egocentric navigation can naturally be represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, social navigation additionally requires reasoning about the hidden beliefs of others, inherently leading to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where agents lack direct access to others' mental states. Inspired by Theory of Mind and Epistemic Planning, we propose (1) a neuro-symbolic model-based reinforcement learning architecture for social navigation, addressing the challenge of belief tracking in partially observable environments; and (2) a perspective-shift operator for belief estimation, leveraging recent work on Influence-based Abstractions (IBA) in structured multi-agent settings.</description>

      <title>Identifying Macro Causal Effects in a C-DMG over ADMGs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal effect identification using causal graphs is a fundamental challenge in causal inference. While extensive research has been conducted in this area, most existing methods assume the availability of fully specified directed acyclic graphs or acyclic directed mixed graphs. However, in complex domains such as medicine and epidemiology, complete causal knowledge is often unavailable, and only partial information about the system is accessible. This paper focuses on causal effect identification within partially specified causal graphs, with particular emphasis on cluster-directed mixed graphs (C-DMGs) which can represent many different acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs). These graphs provide a higher-level representation of causal relationships by grouping variables into clusters, offering a more practical approach for handling complex systems. Unlike fully specified ADMGs, C-DMGs can contain cycles, which complicate their analysis and interpretation. Furthermore, their cluster-based nature introduces new challenges, as it gives rise to two distinct types of causal effects: macro causal effects and micro causal effects, each with different properties. In this work, we focus on macro causal effects, which describe the effects of entire clusters on other clusters. We establish that the do-calculus is both sound and complete for identifying these effects in C-DMGs over ADMGs when the cluster sizes are either unknown or of size greater than one. Additionally, we provide a graphical characterization of non-identifiability for macro causal effects in these graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04942v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatically conjecturing useful, interesting and novel lemmas would greatly improve automated reasoning tools and lower the bar for formalizing mathematics in proof assistants. It is however a very challenging task for both neural and symbolic approaches. We present the first steps towards a practical neuro-symbolic lemma conjecturing tool, Lemmanaid, that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) and symbolic methods, and evaluate it on proof libraries for the Isabelle proof assistant. We train an LLM to generate lemma templates that describe the shape of a lemma, and use symbolic methods to fill in the details. We compare Lemmanaid against an LLM trained to generate complete lemma statements as well as previous fully symbolic conjecturing methods. Lemmanaid outperforms both neural and symbolic methods on test sets from Isabelle's HOL library and from its Archive of Formal Proofs, discovering between 29-39.5% of the gold standard human written lemmas. This is 8-15% more lemmas than the neural-only method. By leveraging the best of both symbolic and neural methods we can generate useful lemmas for a wide range of input domains, facilitating computer-assisted theory development and formalization.</description>

      <title>Assessing AI-Generated Questions' Alignment with Cognitive Frameworks in Educational Assessment</title>

Abstract: This study evaluates the integration of Bloom's Taxonomy into OneClickQuiz, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven plugin for automating Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ) generation in Moodle. Bloom's Taxonomy provides a structured framework for categorizing educational objectives into hierarchical cognitive levels. Our research investigates whether incorporating this taxonomy can improve the alignment of AI-generated questions with specific cognitive objectives. We developed a dataset of 3691 questions categorized according to Bloom's levels and employed various classification models-Multinomial Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Linear Support Vector Classification (SVC), and a Transformer-based model (DistilBERT)-to evaluate their effectiveness in categorizing questions. Our results indicate that higher Bloom's levels generally correlate with increased question length, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), and Lexical Density (LD), reflecting the increased complexity of higher cognitive demands. Multinomial Logistic Regression showed varying accuracy across Bloom's levels, performing best for "Knowledge" and less accurately for higher-order levels. Merging higher-level categories improved accuracy for complex cognitive tasks. Naive Bayes and Linear SVC also demonstrated effective classification for lower levels but struggled with higher-order tasks. DistilBERT achieved the highest performance, significantly improving classification of both lower and higher-order cognitive levels, achieving an overall validation accuracy of 91%. This study highlights the potential of integrating Bloom's Taxonomy into AI-driven assessment tools and underscores the advantages of advanced models like DistilBERT for enhancing educational content generation.</description>

      <title>RECAST: Strengthening LLMs' Complex Instruction Following with Constraint-Verifiable Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to tackle complex tasks, driven by their expanding applications and users' growing proficiency in crafting sophisticated prompts. However, as the number of explicitly stated requirements increases (particularly more than 10 constraints), LLMs often struggle to accurately follow such complex instructions. To address this challenge, we propose RECAST, a novel framework for synthesizing datasets where each example incorporates far more constraints than those in existing benchmarks. These constraints are extracted from real-world prompt-response pairs to ensure practical relevance. RECAST enables automatic verification of constraint satisfaction via rule-based validators for quantitative constraints and LLM-based validators for qualitative ones. Using this framework, we construct RECAST-30K, a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising 30k instances spanning 15 constraint types. Experimental results demonstrate that models fine-tuned on RECAST-30K show substantial improvements in following complex instructions. Moreover, the verifiability provided by RECAST enables the design of reward functions for reinforcement learning, which further boosts model performance on complex and challenging tasks.</description>

Abstract: Are world models a necessary ingredient for flexible, goal-directed behaviour, or is model-free learning sufficient? We provide a formal answer to this question, showing that any agent capable of generalizing to multi-step goal-directed tasks must have learned a predictive model of its environment. We show that this model can be extracted from the agent's policy, and that increasing the agents performance or the complexity of the goals it can achieve requires learning increasingly accurate world models. This has a number of consequences: from developing safe and general agents, to bounding agent capabilities in complex environments, and providing new algorithms for eliciting world models from agents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advanced large reasoning models (LRMs) leverage extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to solve complex tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Despite their success, we identify a critical issue: a substantial portion of simple tasks solved by LRMs can also be addressed by non-reasoning LLMs using significantly fewer tokens, indicating the complex reasoning may not always be necessary. To address this, we systematically analyze the reasoning trajectories of LRMs and present a method utilizing identified paradigms and LLM-Judge to classify these trajectories as either Redundant Reasoning or Essential Reasoning. And we introduce OThink-R1, a method that prunes redundant reasoning steps while preserving logical validity. OThink-R1 dynamically employs the non-thinking mode (fast-thinking) for straightforward problems while engaging in deliberate thinking (slow-thinking) for complex problems. Experiments across mathematical and question-answering tasks demonstrate that OThink-R1 reduces reasoning redundancy by almost 23\% on average without compromising accuracy, offering practical guidelines for efficient reasoning models. The code is available at https://github.com/AgenticIR-Lab/OThink-R1.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Assistants for the Semiconductor Failure Analysis with LLM-Based Planning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Failure Analysis (FA) is a highly intricate and knowledge-intensive process. The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA labs has the potential to automate a variety of tasks, including the detection of non-conformities in images, the retrieval of analogous cases from diverse data sources, and the generation of reports from annotated images. However, as the number of deployed AI models increases, the challenge lies in orchestrating these components into cohesive and efficient workflows that seamlessly integrate with the FA process.
  This paper investigates the design and implementation of an agentic AI system for semiconductor FA using a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Planning Agent (LPA). The LPA integrates LLMs with advanced planning capabilities and external tool utilization, allowing autonomous processing of complex queries, retrieval of relevant data from external systems, and generation of human-readable responses. The evaluation results demonstrate the agent's operational effectiveness and reliability in supporting FA tasks.</description>

      <title>An Integrated Framework of Prompt Engineering and Multidimensional Knowledge Graphs for Legal Dispute Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07893v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Legal dispute analysis is crucial for intelligent legal assistance systems. However, current LLMs face significant challenges in understanding complex legal concepts, maintaining reasoning consistency, and accurately citing legal sources. This research presents a framework combining prompt engineering with multidimensional knowledge graphs to improve LLMs' legal dispute analysis. Specifically, the framework includes a three-stage hierarchical prompt structure (task definition, knowledge background, reasoning guidance) along with a three-layer knowledge graph (legal ontology, representation, instance layers). Additionally, four supporting methods enable precise legal concept retrieval: direct code matching, semantic vector similarity, ontology path reasoning, and lexical segmentation. Through extensive testing, results show major improvements: sensitivity increased by 11.1%-11.3%, specificity by 5.4%-6.0%, and citation accuracy by 29.5%-39.7%. As a result, the framework provides better legal analysis and understanding of judicial logic, thus offering a new technical method for intelligent legal assistance systems.</description>

      <title>A Multi-granularity Concept Sparse Activation and Hierarchical Knowledge Graph Fusion Framework for Rare Disease Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare, rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph (taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09, ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89 approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression, suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease patients.</description>

      <title>Pareto-NRPA: A Novel Monte-Carlo Search Algorithm for Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Pareto-NRPA, a new Monte-Carlo algorithm designed for multi-objective optimization problems over discrete search spaces. Extending the Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA) algorithm originally formulated for single-objective problems, Pareto-NRPA generalizes the nested search and policy update mechanism to multi-objective optimization. The algorithm uses a set of policies to concurrently explore different regions of the solution space and maintains non-dominated fronts at each level of search. Policy adaptation is performed with respect to the diversity and isolation of sequences within the Pareto front. We benchmark Pareto-NRPA on two classes of problems: a novel bi-objective variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows problem (MO-TSPTW), and a neural architecture search task on well-known benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Pareto-NRPA achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms, both in terms of convergence and diversity of solutions. Particularly, Pareto-NRPA strongly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-objective algorithms on constrained search spaces. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first adaptation of NRPA to the multi-objective setting.</description>

      <title>Graph-Augmented Large Language Model Agents: Current Progress and Future Prospects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in a wide range of applications, including web navigation, software development, and embodied control. While most LLMs are limited in several key agentic procedures, such as reliable planning, long-term memory, tool management, and multi-agent coordination, graphs can serve as a powerful auxiliary structure to enhance structure, continuity, and coordination in complex agent workflows. Given the rapid growth and fragmentation of research on Graph-augmented LLM Agents (GLA), this paper offers a timely and comprehensive overview of recent advances and also highlights key directions for future work. Specifically, we categorize existing GLA methods by their primary functions in LLM agent systems, including planning, memory, and tool usage, and then analyze how graphs and graph learning algorithms contribute to each. For multi-agent systems, we further discuss how GLA solutions facilitate the orchestration, efficiency optimization, and trustworthiness of MAS. Finally, we highlight key future directions to advance this field, from improving structural adaptability to enabling unified, scalable, and multimodal GLA systems. We hope this paper can serve as a roadmap for future research on GLA and foster a deeper understanding of the role of graphs in LLM agent systems.</description>

      <title>LUMIR: an LLM-Driven Unified Agent Framework for Multi-task Infrared Spectroscopy Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy enables rapid, non destructive analysis of chemical and material properties, yet high dimensional signals and overlapping bands hinder conventional chemometric methods. Large language models (LLMs), with strong generalization and reasoning capabilities, offer new opportunities for automated spectral interpretation, but their potential in this domain remains largely untapped. This study introduces LUMIR (LLM-driven Unified agent framework for Multi-task Infrared spectroscopy Reasoning), an agent based framework designed to achieve accurate infrared spectral analysis under low data conditions. LUMIR integrates a structured literature knowledge base, automated preprocessing, feature extraction, and predictive modeling into a unified pipeline. By mining peer reviewed spectroscopy studies, it identifies validated preprocessing and feature derivation strategies, transforms spectra into low dimensional representations, and applies few-shot prompts for classification, regression, and anomaly detection. The framework was validated on diverse datasets, including the publicly available Milk near-infrared dataset, Chinese medicinal herbs, Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium(CRP) with different storage durations, an industrial wastewater COD dataset, and two additional public benchmarks, Tecator and Corn. Across these tasks, LUMIR achieved performance comparable to or surpassing established machine learning and deep learning models, particularly in resource limited settings. This work demonstrates that combining structured literature guidance with few-shot learning enables robust, scalable, and automated spectral interpretation. LUMIR establishes a new paradigm for applying LLMs to infrared spectroscopy, offering high accuracy with minimal labeled data and broad applicability across scientific and industrial domains.</description>

      <title>MetaAgent: Toward Self-Evolving Agent via Tool Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose MetaAgent, an agentic paradigm inspired by the principle of learning-by-doing, where expertise is developed through hands-on practice and continual self-improvement. MetaAgent starts with a minimal workflow, equipped only with basic reasoning and adaptive help-seeking abilities. When a knowledge gap is encountered, MetaAgent generates natural language help requests, which are routed to the most suitable external tool by a dedicated tool router. As MetaAgent solves tasks, it continually conducts self-reflection and answer verification, distilling actionable experience into concise texts that are dynamically incorporated into future task contexts. Besides, MetaAgent autonomously builds in-house tools and a persistent knowledge base by organizing its tool-use history, further enhancing its ability to retrieve and integrate relevant information We term this continual, data-driven process as \textit{meta tool learning}, through which MetaAgent incrementally refines its reasoning and tool-use strategies, without changing model parameters or requiring further post-training. Evaluated on challenging knowledge discovery benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalkerQA, and BrowseCamp, MetaAgent consistently outperforms workflow-based baselines and matches or exceeds end-to-end trained agents, demonstrating the promise of self-evolving agentic systems for robust, general-purpose knowledge discovery. We provide our source codes in https://github.com/qhjqhj00/MetaAgent.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey of Self-Evolving AI Agents: A New Paradigm Bridging Foundation Models and Lifelong Agentic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have sparked growing interest in AI agents capable of solving complex, real-world tasks. However, most existing agent systems rely on manually crafted configurations that remain static after deployment, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic and evolving environments. To this end, recent research has explored agent evolution techniques that aim to automatically enhance agent systems based on interaction data and environmental feedback. This emerging direction lays the foundation for self-evolving AI agents, which bridge the static capabilities of foundation models with the continuous adaptability required by lifelong agentic systems. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques for self-evolving agentic systems. Specifically, we first introduce a unified conceptual framework that abstracts the feedback loop underlying the design of self-evolving agentic systems. The framework highlights four key components: System Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers, serving as a foundation for understanding and comparing different strategies. Based on this framework, we systematically review a wide range of self-evolving techniques that target different components of the agent system. We also investigate domain-specific evolution strategies developed for specialised fields such as biomedicine, programming, and finance, where optimisation objectives are tightly coupled with domain constraints. In addition, we provide a dedicated discussion on the evaluation, safety, and ethical considerations for self-evolving agentic systems, which are critical to ensuring their effectiveness and reliability. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a systematic understanding of self-evolving AI agents, laying the foundation for the development of more adaptive, autonomous, and lifelong agentic systems.</description>

      <title>Profile-Aware Maneuvering: A Dynamic Multi-Agent System for Robust GAIA Problem Solving by AWorld</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09889v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has empowered intelligent agents to leverage diverse external tools for solving complex real-world problems. However, this reliance introduces new challenges, as extended contexts and noisy tool outputs can undermine system reliability. To address this, we propose a dynamic Multi-Agent System (MAS) in our AWorld framework, where an Execution Agent is supervised by a Guard Agent that provides on-demand dynamic maneuvering, verifying and correcting the reasoning process to improve robustness over single-agent systems. To move beyond this generic supervision, we enhance the architecture with a methodology inspired by System Identification from control theory. This method first profiles the Execution Agent offline on a benchmark dataset to create a "performance fingerprint" of its unique weaknesses. The Guard Agent then leverages this fingerprint online to deliver profile-aware supervision, making targeted interventions based on known failure patterns rather than merely reacting to immediate logical flaws. Extensive experiments on the GAIA dataset demonstrate that this profile-aware MAS significantly improves both effectiveness and stability, outperforming not only single-agent systems but also its naive counterpart. This superior performance led our system to achieve first place among open-source projects on the prestigious GAIA leaderboard. These findings highlight that building truly trustworthy intelligent systems requires not just collaboration, but a deep, empirically-grounded understanding of each agent's unique capabilities and limitations.</description>

      <title>Inclusion Arena: An Open Platform for Evaluating Large Foundation Models with Real-World Apps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have ushered in a new era of AI capabilities, demonstrating near-human-level performance across diverse scenarios. While numerous benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) and leaderboards (e.g., Chatbot Arena) have been proposed to help evolve the development of LLMs and MLLMs, most rely on static datasets or crowdsourced general-domain prompts, often falling short of reflecting performance in real-world applications. To bridge this critical gap, we present Inclusion Arena, a live leaderboard that ranks models based on human feedback collected directly from AI-powered applications. Our platform integrates pairwise model comparisons into natural user interactions, ensuring evaluations reflect practical usage scenarios. For robust model ranking, we employ the Bradley-Terry model augmented with two key innovations: (1) Placement Matches, a cold-start mechanism to quickly estimate initial ratings for newly integrated models, and (2) Proximity Sampling, an intelligent comparison strategy that prioritizes battles between models of similar capabilities to maximize information gain and enhance rating stability. Extensive empirical analyses and simulations demonstrate that Inclusion Arena yields reliable and stable rankings, exhibits higher data transitivity compared to general crowdsourced datasets, and significantly mitigates the risk of malicious manipulation. By fostering an open alliance between foundation models and real-world applications, Inclusion Arena aims to accelerate the development of LLMs and MLLMs truly optimized for practical, user-centric deployments. The platform is publicly accessible at https://www.tbox.cn/about/model-ranking.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces GUI-Owl, a foundational GUI agent model that achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source end-to-end models on ten GUI benchmarks across desktop and mobile environments, covering grounding, question answering, planning, decision-making, and procedural knowledge. GUI-Owl-7B achieves 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld. Building on this, we propose Mobile-Agent-v3, a general-purpose GUI agent framework that further improves performance to 73.3 on AndroidWorld and 37.7 on OSWorld, setting a new state-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows, enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment. We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for online RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld. GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 are open-sourced at https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent.</description>

      <title>AI Chaperones Are (Really) All You Need to Prevent Parasocial Relationships with Chatbots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15748v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging reports of the harms caused to children and adults by AI sycophancy and by parasocial ties with chatbots point to an urgent need for safeguards against such risks. Yet, preventing such dynamics is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private conversations between chatbots and users, and we lack effective methods to mitigate these risks. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation framework (an AI chaperone agent) created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model to evaluate ongoing conversations for parasocial cues. We constructed a small synthetic dataset of thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations. Iterative evaluation with five-stage testing successfully identified all parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that AI chaperones can be a viable solution for reducing the risk of parasocial relationships.</description>

      <title>Route-and-Execute: Auditable Model-Card Matching and Specialty-Level Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clinical workflows are fragmented as a patchwork of scripts and task-specific networks that often handle triage, task selection, and model deployment. These pipelines are rarely streamlined for data science pipeline, reducing efficiency and raising operational costs. Workflows also lack data-driven model identification (from imaging/tabular inputs) and standardized delivery of model outputs. In response, we present a practical, healthcare-first framework that uses a single vision-language model (VLM) in two complementary roles. First (Solution 1), the VLM acts as an aware model-card matcher that routes an incoming image to the appropriate specialist model via a three-stage workflow (modality -&gt; primary abnormality -&gt; model-card id). Checks are provided by (i) stagewise prompts that allow early exit via None/Normal/Other and (ii) a stagewise answer selector that arbitrates between the top-2 candidates at each stage, reducing the chance of an incorrect selection and aligning the workflow with clinical risk tolerance. Second (Solution 2), we fine-tune the VLM on specialty-specific datasets ensuring a single model covers multiple downstream tasks within each specialty, maintaining performance while simplifying deployment. Across gastroenterology, hematology, ophthalmology, and pathology, our single-model deployment matches or approaches specialized baselines.
  Compared with pipelines composed of many task-specific agents, this approach shows that one VLM can both decide and do. It may reduce effort by data scientists, shorten monitoring, increase the transparency of model selection (with per-stage justifications), and lower integration overhead.</description>

      <title>ST-Raptor: LLM-Powered Semi-Structured Table Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g., financial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve flexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells). These tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and answer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To automate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First, methods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured ones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like NL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of semi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To this end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured table question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures complex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for constructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to guide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor decomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree operation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate pipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism: forward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward validation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from predicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of 764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that ST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor.</description>

      <title>VistaWise: Building Cost-Effective Agent with Cross-Modal Knowledge Graph for Minecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in embodied decision-making tasks within virtual open-world environments. Nonetheless, their performance is hindered by the absence of domain-specific knowledge. Methods that finetune on large-scale domain-specific data entail prohibitive development costs. This paper introduces VistaWise, a cost-effective agent framework that integrates cross-modal domain knowledge and finetunes a dedicated object detection model for visual analysis. It reduces the requirement for domain-specific training data from millions of samples to a few hundred. VistaWise integrates visual information and textual dependencies into a cross-modal knowledge graph (KG), enabling a comprehensive and accurate understanding of multimodal environments. We also equip the agent with a retrieval-based pooling strategy to extract task-related information from the KG, and a desktop-level skill library to support direct operation of the Minecraft desktop client via mouse and keyboard inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that VistaWise achieves state-of-the-art performance across various open-world tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing development costs while enhancing agent performance.</description>

      <title>Building Self-Evolving Agents via Experience-Driven Lifelong Learning: A Framework and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning (ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous, self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory: Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife is designed around three key paradigm</description>

      <title>MAB Optimizer for Estimating Math Question Difficulty via Inverse CV without NLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of technology and education is driving the emergence of Intelligent &amp; Autonomous Tutoring Systems (IATS), where objective and domain-agnostic methods for determining question difficulty are essential. Traditional human labeling is subjective, and existing NLP-based approaches fail in symbolic domains like algebra. This study introduces the Approach of Passive Measures among Educands (APME), a reinforcement learning-based Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that estimates difficulty solely from solver performance data -- marks obtained and time taken -- without requiring linguistic features or expert labels. By leveraging the inverse coefficient of variation as a risk-adjusted metric, the model provides an explainable and scalable mechanism for adaptive assessment. Empirical validation was conducted on three heterogeneous datasets. Across these diverse contexts, the model achieved an average R2 of 0.9213 and an average RMSE of 0.0584, confirming its robustness, accuracy, and adaptability to different educational levels and assessment formats. Compared with baseline approaches-such as regression-based, NLP-driven, and IRT models-the proposed framework consistently outperformed alternatives, particularly in purely symbolic domains. The findings highlight that (i) item heterogeneity strongly influences perceived difficulty, and (ii) variance in solver outcomes is as critical as mean performance for adaptive allocation. Pedagogically, the model aligns with Vygotskys Zone of Proximal Development by identifying tasks that balance challenge and attainability, supporting motivation while minimizing disengagement. This domain-agnostic, self-supervised approach advances difficulty tagging in IATS and can be extended beyond algebra wherever solver interaction data is available</description>

      <title>Instructional Agents: LLM Agents on Automated Course Material Generation for Teaching Faculties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preparing high-quality instructional materials remains a labor-intensive process that often requires extensive coordination among teaching faculty, instructional designers, and teaching assistants. In this work, we present Instructional Agents, a multi-agent large language model (LLM) framework designed to automate end-to-end course material generation, including syllabus creation, lecture scripts, LaTeX-based slides, and assessments. Unlike existing AI-assisted educational tools that focus on isolated tasks, Instructional Agents simulates role-based collaboration among educational agents to produce cohesive and pedagogically aligned content. The system operates in four modes: Autonomous, Catalog-Guided, Feedback-Guided, and Full Co-Pilot mode, enabling flexible control over the degree of human involvement. We evaluate Instructional Agents across five university-level computer science courses and show that it produces high-quality instructional materials while significantly reducing development time and human workload. By supporting institutions with limited instructional design capacity, Instructional Agents provides a scalable and cost-effective framework to democratize access to high-quality education, particularly in underserved or resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>AWorld: Orchestrating the Training Recipe for Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The learning from practice paradigm is crucial for developing capable Agentic AI systems, yet it is severely hampered by inefficient experience generation, a bottleneck especially pronounced in complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address this, we introduce AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale agent-environment interaction. By distributing tasks across a cluster, AWorld accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node, sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement learning practical and scalable. Leveraging this capability, we trained a Qwen3-32B-based agent that achieves pass@1 accuracy of 32.23% on the GAIA test set, which surpasses GPT-4o (27.91%) and rivals DeepSeek-V3 (31.89%). Our open-source system and the resulting agent provide a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training pipeline, from efficient interaction to demonstrable model improvement.</description>

      <title>Net2Brain: A Toolbox to compare artificial vision models with human brain responses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.09677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Net2Brain, a graphical and command-line user interface toolbox for comparing the representational spaces of artificial deep neural networks (DNNs) and human brain recordings. While different toolboxes facilitate only single functionalities or only focus on a small subset of supervised image classification models, Net2Brain allows the extraction of activations of more than 600 DNNs trained to perform a diverse range of vision-related tasks (e.g semantic segmentation, depth estimation, action recognition, etc.), over both image and video datasets. The toolbox computes the representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) over those activations and compares them to brain recordings using representational similarity analysis (RSA), weighted RSA, both in specific ROIs and with searchlight search. In addition, it is possible to add a new data set of stimuli and brain recordings to the toolbox for evaluation. We demonstrate the functionality and advantages of Net2Brain with an example showcasing how it can be used to test hypotheses of cognitive computational neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Adapter for Vision-Language Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language retrieval is an important multi-modal learning topic, where the goal is to retrieve the most relevant visual candidate for a given text query. Recently, pre-trained models, e.g., CLIP, show great potential on retrieval tasks. However, as pre-trained models are scaling up, fully fine-tuning them on donwstream retrieval datasets has a high risk of overfitting. Moreover, in practice, it would be costly to train and store a large model for each task. To overcome the above issues, we present a novel Cross-Modal Adapter for parameter-efficient transfer learning. Inspired by adapter-based methods, we adjust the pre-trained model with a few parameterization layers. However, there are two notable differences. First, our method is designed for the multi-modal domain. Secondly, it allows encoder-level implicit cross-modal interactions between vision and language encoders. Although surprisingly simple, our approach has three notable benefits: (1) reduces the vast majority of fine-tuned parameters, (2) saves training time, and (3) allows all the pre-trained parameters to be fixed, enabling the pre-trained model to be shared across datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, without bells and whistles, our approach outperforms adapter-based methods on image-text retrieval datasets (MSCOCO, Flickr30K) and video-text retrieval datasets (MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet).</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Directed Hypergraph Neural Network over abstract syntax tree (AST) for Code Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04228v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Code classification is a difficult issue in program understanding and automatic coding. Due to the elusive syntax and complicated semantics in programs, most existing studies use techniques based on abstract syntax tree (AST) and graph neural networks (GNN) to create code representations for code classification. These techniques utilize the structure and semantic information of the code, but they only take into account pairwise associations and neglect the high-order data correlations that already exist between nodes of the same field or called attribute in the AST, which may result in the loss of code structural information. On the other hand, while a general hypergraph can encode high-order data correlations, it is homogeneous and undirected which will result in a lack of semantic and structural information such as node types, edge types, and directions between child nodes and parent nodes when modeling AST. In this study, we propose a heterogeneous directed hypergraph (HDHG) to represent AST and a heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) to process the graph for code classification. Our method improves code understanding and can represent high-order data correlations beyond paired interactions. We assess our heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) on public datasets of Python and Java programs. Our method outperforms previous AST-based and GNN-based methods, which demonstrates the capability of our model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quadratic complexity of dot-product attention introduced in Transformer remains a fundamental bottleneck impeding the progress of foundation models toward unbounded context lengths. Addressing this challenge, we introduce the Deep Tensor Network, a new architectural framework that fundamentally reformulates attention by unifying the expressive power of tensor algebra with neural network design. Our approach moves beyond both conventional dot-product attention and subsequent linear-time approximations to capture higher-order statistical dependencies. We introduce two core operators derived from this framework: \emph{Tensor Attention}, which models complex token-mixing via data-dependent polynomial kernels, and Tensor Interaction, a novel mechanism for adaptive channel-mixing. We demonstrate that these operators are powered by second-order summaries that entirely bypass the formation of $n \times n$ matrices, enabling a causality-preserving streaming implementation with $O(d^2)$ per-token updates and $O(d^2)$ state. This efficiency rivals that of modern State Space Models while retaining an attention-like formulation. The Deep Tensor Network thus provides a principled and powerful new class of building blocks for next-generation sequence models, bridging the gap between scalable computation and rich, expressive interaction modeling.</description>

      <title>An Information-Flow Perspective on Algorithmic Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents insights gained by investigating the relationship between algorithmic fairness and the concept of secure information flow. The problem of enforcing secure information flow is well-studied in the context of information security: If secret information may "flow" through an algorithm or program in such a way that it can influence the program's output, then that is considered insecure information flow as attackers could potentially observe (parts of) the secret.
  There is a strong correspondence between secure information flow and algorithmic fairness: if protected attributes such as race, gender, or age are treated as secret program inputs, then secure information flow means that these ``secret'' attributes cannot influence the result of a program. While most research in algorithmic fairness evaluation concentrates on studying the impact of algorithms (often treating the algorithm as a black-box), the concepts derived from information flow can be used both for the analysis of disparate treatment as well as disparate impact w.r.t. a structural causal model.
  In this paper, we examine the relationship between quantitative as well as qualitative information-flow properties and fairness. Moreover, based on this duality, we derive a new quantitative notion of fairness called fairness spread, which can be easily analyzed using quantitative information flow and which strongly relates to counterfactual fairness. We demonstrate that off-the-shelf tools for information-flow properties can be used in order to formally analyze a program's algorithmic fairness properties, including the new notion of fairness spread as well as established notions such as demographic parity.</description>

      <title>Exploring Large Language Models in Resolving Environment-Related Crash Bugs: Localizing and Repairing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Software crash bugs cause unexpected program behaviors or even abrupt termination, thus demanding immediate resolution. However, resolving crash bugs can be challenging due to their complex root causes, which can originate from issues in the source code or external factors like third-party library dependencies. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in software engineering tasks. However, existing research predominantly focuses on the capability of LLMs to localize and repair code-related crash bugs, leaving their effectiveness in resolving environment-related crash bugs in real-world software unexplored. To fill this gap, we conducted the first comprehensive study to assess the capability of LLMs in resolving real-world environment-related crash bugs. We first systematically compare LLMs' performance in resolving code-related and environment-related crash bugs with varying levels of crash contextual information. Our findings reveal that localization is the primary challenge for resolving code-related crashes, while repair poses a greater challenge for environment-related crashes. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different prompt strategies on improving the resolution of environment-related crash bugs, incorporating different prompt templates and multi-round interactions. Building on this, we further explore an advanced active inquiry prompting strategy leveraging the self-planning capabilities of LLMs. Based on these explorations, we propose IntDiagSolver, an interactive methodology designed to enable precise crash bug resolution through ongoing engagement with LLMs. Extensive evaluations of IntDiagSolver across multiple LLMs (including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, CodeLlama, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen-3-Coder) demonstrate consistent improvements in resolution accuracy, with substantial enhancements ranging from 9.1% to 43.3% in localization and 9.1% to 53.3% in repair.</description>

      <title>Detecting LLM-assisted writing in scientific communication: Are we there yet?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT, have significantly reshaped text generation, particularly in the realm of writing assistance. While ethical considerations underscore the importance of transparently acknowledging LLM use, especially in scientific communication, genuine acknowledgment remains infrequent. A potential avenue to encourage accurate acknowledging of LLM-assisted writing involves employing automated detectors. Our evaluation of four cutting-edge LLM-generated text detectors reveals their suboptimal performance compared to a simple ad-hoc detector designed to identify abrupt writing style changes around the time of LLM proliferation. We contend that the development of specialized detectors exclusively dedicated to LLM-assisted writing detection is necessary. Such detectors could play a crucial role in fostering more authentic recognition of LLM involvement in scientific communication, addressing the current challenges in acknowledgment practices.</description>

Abstract: Traffic-Sign Recognition (TSR) is a critical safety component for autonomous driving. Unfortunately, however, past work has highlighted the vulnerability of TSR models to physical-world attacks, through low-cost, easily deployable adversarial patches leading to misclassification. To mitigate these threats, most defenses focus on altering the training process or modifying the inference procedure. Still, while these approaches improve adversarial robustness, TSR remains susceptible to attacks attaining substantial success rates.
  To further the adversarial robustness of TSR, this work offers a novel approach that redefines traffic-sign designs to create signs that promote robustness while remaining interpretable to humans. Our framework takes three inputs: (1) A traffic-sign standard along with modifiable features and associated constraints; (2) A state-of-the-art adversarial training method; and (3) A function for efficiently synthesizing realistic traffic-sign images. Using these user-defined inputs, the framework emits an optimized traffic-sign standard such that traffic signs generated per this standard enable training TSR models with increased adversarial robustness.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework via a concrete implementation, where we allow modifying the pictograms (i.e., symbols) and colors of traffic signs. The results show substantial improvements in robustness -- with gains of up to 16.33%--24.58% in robust accuracy over state-of-the-art methods -- while benign accuracy is even improved. Importantly, a user study also confirms that the redesigned traffic signs remain easily recognizable and to human observers. Overall, the results highlight that carefully redesigning traffic signs can significantly enhance TSR system robustness without compromising human interpretability.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Risk-Sensitive Policy Gradient: An Iteration Complexity Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08955v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown exceptional performance across various applications, enabling autonomous agents to learn optimal policies through interaction with their environments. However, traditional RL frameworks often face challenges in terms of iteration efficiency and safety. Risk-sensitive policy gradient methods, which incorporate both expected return and risk measures, have been explored for their ability to yield safe policies, yet their iteration complexity remains largely underexplored. In this work, we conduct a rigorous iteration complexity analysis for the risk-sensitive policy gradient method, focusing on the REINFORCE algorithm with an exponential utility function. We establish an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ to reach an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order stationary point (FOSP). Furthermore, we investigate whether risk-sensitive algorithms can achieve better iteration complexity compared to their risk-neutral counterparts. Our analysis indicates that risk-sensitive REINFORCE can potentially converge faster. To validate our analysis, we empirically evaluate the learning performance and convergence efficiency of the risk-neutral and risk-sensitive REINFORCE algorithms in multiple environments: CartPole, MiniGrid, and Robot Navigation. Empirical results confirm that risk-sensitive cases can converge and stabilize faster compared to their risk-neutral counterparts. More details can be found on our website https://anonymous.4open.science/w/riskrl.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Black-box Deployment Strategies for Edge AI on Latency and Model Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17154v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deciding what combination of operators to use across the Edge AI tiers to achieve specific latency and model performance requirements is an open question for MLOps engineers. This study aims to empirically assess the accuracy vs inference time trade-off of different black-box Edge AI deployment strategies, i.e., combinations of deployment operators and deployment tiers. In this paper, we conduct inference experiments involving 3 deployment operators (i.e., Partitioning, Quantization, Early Exit), 3 deployment tiers (i.e., Mobile, Edge, Cloud) and their combinations on four widely used Computer-Vision models to investigate the optimal strategies from the point of view of MLOps developers. Our findings suggest that Edge deployment using the hybrid Quantization + Early Exit operator could be preferred over non-hybrid operators (Quantization/Early Exit on Edge, Partition on Mobile-Edge) when faster latency is a concern at medium accuracy loss. However, when minimizing accuracy loss is a concern, MLOps engineers should prefer using only a Quantization operator on edge at a latency reduction or increase, respectively over the Early Exit/Partition (on edge/mobile-edge) and Quantized Early Exit (on edge) operators. In scenarios constrained by Mobile CPU/RAM resources, a preference for Partitioning across mobile and edge tiers is observed over mobile deployment. For models with smaller input data samples (such as FCN), a network-constrained cloud deployment can also be a better alternative than Mobile/Edge deployment and Partitioning strategies. For models with large input data samples (ResNet, ResNext, DUC), an edge tier having higher network/computational capabilities than Cloud/Mobile can be a more viable option than Partitioning and Mobile/Cloud deployment strategies.</description>

      <title>Guiding Large Language Models to Post-Edit Machine Translation with Error Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) remains one of the last NLP tasks where large language models (LLMs) have not yet replaced dedicated supervised systems. This work exploits the complementary strengths of LLMs and supervised MT by guiding LLMs to automatically post-edit MT with external feedback on its quality, derived from Multidimensional Quality Metric (MQM) annotations. Working with LLaMA-2 models, we consider prompting strategies varying the nature of feedback provided and then fine-tune the LLM to improve its ability to exploit the provided guidance. Through experiments on Chinese-English, English-German, and English-Russian MQM data, we demonstrate that prompting LLMs to post-edit MT improves TER, BLEU and COMET scores, although the benefits of fine-grained feedback are not clear. Fine-tuning helps integrate fine-grained feedback more effectively and further improves translation quality based on both automatic and human evaluation.</description>

      <title>CLARE: Cognitive Load Assessment in REaltime with Multimodal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel multimodal dataset for Cognitive Load Assessment in REal-time (CLARE). The dataset contains physiological and gaze data from 24 participants with self-reported cognitive load scores as ground-truth labels. The dataset consists of four modalities, namely, Electrocardiography (ECG), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Electroencephalogram (EEG), and Gaze tracking. To map diverse levels of mental load on participants during experiments, each participant completed four nine-minutes sessions on a computer-based operator performance and mental workload task (the MATB-II software) with varying levels of complexity in one minute segments. During the experiment, participants reported their cognitive load every 10 seconds. For the dataset, we also provide benchmark binary classification results with machine learning and deep learning models on two different evaluation schemes, namely, 10-fold and leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation. Benchmark results show that for 10-fold evaluation, the convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning model achieves the best classification performance with ECG, EDA, and Gaze. In contrast, for LOSO, the best performance is achieved by the deep learning model with ECG, EDA, and EEG.</description>

      <title>Towards Incremental Learning in Large Language Models: A Critical Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18311v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incremental learning is the ability of systems to acquire knowledge over time, enabling their adaptation and generalization to novel tasks. It is a critical ability for intelligent, real-world systems, especially when data changes frequently or is limited. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of incremental learning in Large Language Models. It synthesizes the state-of-the-art incremental learning paradigms, including continual learning, meta-learning, parameter-efficient learning, and mixture-of-experts learning. We demonstrate their utility for incremental learning by describing specific achievements from these related topics and their critical factors. An important finding is that many of these approaches do not update the core model, and none of them update incrementally in real-time. The paper highlights current problems and challenges for future research in the field. By consolidating the latest relevant research developments, this review offers a comprehensive understanding of incremental learning and its implications for designing and developing LLM-based learning systems.</description>

      <title>Space-aware Socioeconomic Indicator Inference with Heterogeneous Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14135v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regional socioeconomic indicators are critical across various domains, yet their acquisition can be costly. Inferring global socioeconomic indicators from a limited number of regional samples is essential for enhancing management and sustainability in urban areas and human settlements. Current inference methods typically rely on spatial interpolation based on the assumption of spatial continuity, which does not adequately address the complex variations present within regional spaces. In this paper, we present GeoHG, the first space-aware socioeconomic indicator inference method that utilizes a heterogeneous graph-based structure to represent geospace for non-continuous inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoHG in comparison to existing methods, achieving an $R^2$ score exceeding 0.8 under extreme data scarcity with a masked ratio of 95\%.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Offline Data in Linear Latent Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging offline data is an attractive way to accelerate online sequential decision-making. However, it is crucial to account for latent states in users or environments in the offline data, and latent bandits form a compelling model for doing so. In this light, we design end-to-end latent bandit algorithms capable of handing uncountably many latent states. We focus on a linear latent contextual bandit $-$ a linear bandit where each user has its own high-dimensional reward parameter in $\mathbb{R}^{d_A}$, but reward parameters across users lie in a low-rank latent subspace of dimension $d_K \ll d_A$. First, we provide an offline algorithm to learn this subspace with provable guarantees. We then present two online algorithms that utilize the output of this offline algorithm to accelerate online learning. The first enjoys $\tilde{O}(\min(d_A\sqrt{T}, d_K\sqrt{T}(1+\sqrt{d_AT/d_KN})))$ regret guarantees, so that the effective dimension is lower when the size $N$ of the offline dataset is larger. We prove a matching lower bound on regret, showing that our algorithm is minimax optimal. The second is a practical algorithm that enjoys only a slightly weaker guarantee, but is computationally efficient. We also establish the efficacy of our methods using experiments on both synthetic data and real-life movie recommendation data from MovieLens. Finally, we theoretically establish the generality of the latent bandit model by proving a de Finetti theorem for stateless decision processes.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Test of Unlearning Using Parametric Knowledge Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of "unlearning" certain concepts in large language models (LLMs) has attracted immense attention recently, due to its importance in mitigating undesirable model behaviours, such as the generation of harmful, private, or incorrect information. Current protocols to evaluate unlearning methods largely rely on behavioral tests, without monitoring the presence of unlearned knowledge within the model's parameters. This residual knowledge can be adversarially exploited to recover the erased information post-unlearning. We argue that unlearning should also be evaluated internally, by considering changes in the parametric knowledge traces of the unlearned concepts. To this end, we propose a general evaluation methodology that leverages vocabulary projections to inspect concepts encoded in model parameters. We use this approach to localize "concept vectors" - parameter vectors that encode concrete concepts - and construct ConceptVectors, a benchmark dataset containing hundreds of common concepts and their parametric knowledge traces within two open-source LLMs. Evaluation on ConceptVectors shows that existing unlearning methods minimally impact concept vectors and mostly suppress them during inference, while directly ablating these vectors demonstrably removes the associated knowledge and significantly reduces the model's susceptibility to adversarial manipulation. Our results highlight limitations in behavioral-based unlearning evaluations and call for future work to include parameter-based evaluations. To support this, we release our code and benchmark at https://github.com/yihuaihong/ConceptVectors.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Transformers with Centralized Aggregation are Sample-Efficient Multi-Agent World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning a world model for model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can significantly improve the sample efficiency by learning policies in imagination. However, building a world model for Multi-Agent RL (MARL) can be particularly challenging due to the scalability issue in a centralized architecture arising from a large number of agents, and also the non-stationarity issue in a decentralized architecture stemming from the inter-dependency among agents. To address both challenges, we propose a novel world model for MARL that learns decentralized local dynamics for scalability, combined with a centralized representation aggregation from all agents. We cast the dynamics learning as an auto-regressive sequence modeling problem over discrete tokens by leveraging the expressive Transformer architecture, in order to model complex local dynamics across different agents and provide accurate and consistent long-term imaginations. As the first pioneering Transformer-based world model for multi-agent systems, we introduce a Perceiver Transformer as an effective solution to enable centralized representation aggregation within this context. Results on Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) show that it outperforms strong model-free approaches and existing model-based methods in both sample efficiency and overall performance.</description>

      <title>Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04620v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden states. We present a practical framework for instantiating sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and expressive hidden states. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Similar to Transformer, TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural physical, chemical, and biological dynamical systems are often complex, with heterogeneous components interacting in diverse ways. We show how simple graph neural networks can be designed to jointly learn the interaction rules and the latent heterogeneity from observable dynamics. The learned latent heterogeneity and dynamics can be used to virtually decompose the complex system which is necessary to infer and parameterize the underlying governing equations. We tested the approach with simulation experiments of interacting moving particles, vector fields, and signaling networks. While our current aim is to better understand and validate the approach with simulated data, we anticipate it to become a generally applicable tool to uncover the governing rules underlying complex dynamics observed in nature.</description>

      <title>Learn while Unlearn: An Iterative Unlearning Framework for Generative Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20271v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP), have produced powerful models trained on vast datasets. However, these models risk leaking sensitive information, raising privacy concerns. In response, regulatory measures such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have driven increasing interest in Machine Unlearning techniques, which enable models to selectively forget specific data entries. Early unlearning approaches primarily relied on pre-processing methods, while more recent research has shifted towards training-based solutions. Despite their effectiveness, a key limitation persists: most methods require access to original training data, which is often unavailable. Additionally, directly applying unlearning techniques bears the cost of undermining the model's expressive capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce the Iterative Contrastive Unlearning (ICU) framework, which consists of three core components: A Knowledge Unlearning Induction module designed to target specific knowledge for removal using an unlearning loss; A Contrastive Learning Enhancement module to preserve the model's expressive capabilities against the pure unlearning goal; And an Iterative Unlearning Refinement module that dynamically adjusts the unlearning process through ongoing evaluation and updates. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our ICU method in unlearning sensitive information while maintaining the model's overall performance, offering a promising solution for privacy-conscious machine learning applications.</description>

Abstract: Although artificial intelligence (AI) systems are becoming increasingly indispensable, research into how humans rely on these systems (AI reliance) is lagging behind. To advance this research, this survey presents a novel, comprehensive sociotechnical perspective on AI reliance, essential to fully understand the phenomenon. To address these challenges, the survey introduces a categorization framework resulting in a morphological box, which guides rigorous AI reliance research. Further, the survey identifies the core influences on AI reliance within the components of a sociotechnical system and discusses current limitations alongside emerging future research avenues to form a research agenda.</description>

      <title>MEGen: Generative Backdoor into Large Language Models via Model Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable versatility and adaptability, while their widespread adoption across various applications also raises critical safety concerns. This paper focuses on the impact of backdoored LLMs. Traditional backdoor injection methods are primarily limited to yes-or-no discriminative tasks, leading users to underestimate the potential risks of backdoored LLMs. Given the inherently generative nature of LLMs, this paper reveals that a generative backdoor injected into LLMs can expose the true safety risks in their applications. We propose an editing-based generative backdoor, named MEGen, aiming to expand the backdoor to generative tasks in a unified format of any text-to any text, leading to natural generations with a specific intention. Experiments show that MEGen achieves a high attack success rate by adjusting only a small set of local parameters with few-shot samples. Notably, we show that the backdoored model, when triggered, can freely output pre-set dangerous information while completing downstream tasks. Our work highlights that MEGen enables backdoors in LLMs to exhibit generative capabilities, causing potential safety risks by altering the generative style.

      <title>Efficient Detection of Toxic Prompts in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11727v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini have significantly advanced natural language processing, enabling various applications such as chatbots and automated content generation. However, these models can be exploited by malicious individuals who craft toxic prompts to elicit harmful or unethical responses. These individuals often employ jailbreaking techniques to bypass safety mechanisms, highlighting the need for robust toxic prompt detection methods. Existing detection techniques, both blackbox and whitebox, face challenges related to the diversity of toxic prompts, scalability, and computational efficiency. In response, we propose ToxicDetector, a lightweight greybox method designed to efficiently detect toxic prompts in LLMs. ToxicDetector leverages LLMs to create toxic concept prompts, uses embedding vectors to form feature vectors, and employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier for prompt classification. Our evaluation on various versions of the LLama models, Gemma-2, and multiple datasets demonstrates that ToxicDetector achieves a high accuracy of 96.39\% and a low false positive rate of 2.00\%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ToxicDetector's processing time of 0.0780 seconds per prompt makes it highly suitable for real-time applications. ToxicDetector achieves high accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, making it a practical method for toxic prompt detection in LLMs.</description>

      <title>A Law of Next-Token Prediction in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely employed across various application domains, yet their black-box nature poses significant challenges to understanding how these models process input data internally to make predictions. In this paper, we introduce a precise and quantitative law that governs the learning of contextualized token embeddings through intermediate layers in pre-trained LLMs for next-token prediction. Our findings reveal that each layer contributes equally to enhancing prediction accuracy, from the lowest to the highest layer -- a universal phenomenon observed across a diverse array of open-source LLMs, irrespective of their architectures or pre-training data. We demonstrate that this law offers new perspectives and actionable insights to inform and guide practices in LLM development and applications, including model scaling, pre-training tasks, and interpretation.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Attacks and Defenses in Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting for Smart and Connected Infrastructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of deep learning models has revolutionized various industries over the last decade, leading to a surge in connected devices and infrastructures. However, these models can be tricked into making incorrect predictions with high confidence, leading to disastrous failures and security concerns. To this end, we explore the impact of adversarial attacks on multivariate time-series forecasting and investigate methods to counter them. Specifically, we employ untargeted white-box attacks, namely the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and the Basic Iterative Method (BIM), to poison the inputs to the training process, effectively misleading the model. We also illustrate the subtle modifications to the inputs after the attack, which makes detecting the attack using the naked eye quite difficult. Having demonstrated the feasibility of these attacks, we develop robust models through adversarial training and model hardening. We are among the first to showcase the transferability of these attacks and defenses by extrapolating our work from the benchmark electricity data to a larger, 10-year real-world data used for predicting the time-to-failure of hard disks. Our experimental results confirm that the attacks and defenses achieve the desired security thresholds, leading to a 72.41% and 94.81% decrease in RMSE for the electricity and hard disk datasets respectively after implementing the adversarial defenses.</description>

      <title>VSLLaVA: a pipeline of large multimodal foundation model for industrial vibration signal analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in general multimodal tasks, they lack the domain-specific knowledge for industrial vibration signal analysis. This paper introduces VSLLaVA, a comprehensive pipeline that utilizes expert knowledge-guided instruction tuning and evaluation to create an end-to-end LMM for signal analysis. To achieve this, we construct a novel Signal-Question-Answer (SQA) dataset using an expert rule-based signal generator. This dataset facilitates a two-stage learning procedure. The first step is efficient instruction fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which imparts specialized signal identification capabilities. Subsequently, we designed a tailored Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine the reasoning capabilities and enhance classification robustness. Then, a dual-mode evaluation framework is proposed, combining an LLM referee with expert rules for semantic assessment using quantitative metrics for numerical and textual accuracy, which reveals that VSLLaVA significantly improves performance in signal type identification and parameter analysis, and makes progress in the identification and parameter analysis of fault-related signals. This research demonstrates a viable approach for developing specialized foundational models for complex industrial applications and marks a transition from conventional task-specific systems to a cohesive, interactive foundational model.</description>

      <title>On the Diagram of Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10038v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but often falter on complex problems that require structured, multi-step reasoning. We introduce the Diagram of Thought (DoT), a new framework that enables a single LLM to build and navigate a mental map of its reasoning. Instead of thinking in a straight line, the model constructs a dynamic diagram of ideas, where it can propose different lines of thought, critique its own steps, and synthesize validated insights into a final conclusion. This entire process is self-contained within the model, making it highly efficient by avoiding the complex external controllers or search algorithms required by other methods. To ensure the reliability of this process, we ground DoT in a rigorous mathematical framework from category theory. This foundation guarantees that the way the model combines information is logical, consistent, and robust, regardless of the order in which ideas were explored. The result is a more powerful and transparent reasoning process that produces a fully auditable, step-by-step trace of the LLM's thinking, bridging the gap between fluent language and formal reasoning.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Semantic Leakage in Cross-lingual Embeddings via Orthogonality Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately aligning contextual representations in cross-lingual sentence embeddings is key for effective parallel data mining. A common strategy for achieving this alignment involves disentangling semantics and language in sentence embeddings derived from multilingual pre-trained models. However, we discover that current disentangled representation learning methods suffer from semantic leakage - a term we introduce to describe when a substantial amount of language-specific information is unintentionally leaked into semantic representations. This hinders the effective disentanglement of semantic and language representations, making it difficult to retrieve embeddings that distinctively represent the meaning of the sentence. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training objective, ORthogonAlity Constraint LEarning (ORACLE), tailored to enforce orthogonality between semantic and language embeddings. ORACLE builds upon two components: intra-class clustering and inter-class separation. Through experiments on cross-lingual retrieval and semantic textual similarity tasks, we demonstrate that training with the ORACLE objective effectively reduces semantic leakage and enhances semantic alignment within the embedding space.</description>

      <title>Learning in complex action spaces without policy gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While conventional wisdom holds that policy gradient methods are better suited to complex action spaces than action-value methods, foundational work has shown that the two paradigms are equivalent in small, finite action spaces (O'Donoghue et al., 2017; Schulman et al., 2017a). This raises the question of why their computational applicability and performance diverge as the complexity of the action space increases. We hypothesize that the apparent superiority of policy gradients in such settings stems not from intrinsic qualities of the paradigm but from universal principles that can also be applied to action-value methods, enabling similar functions. We identify three such principles and provide a framework for incorporating them into action-value methods. To support our hypothesis, we instantiate this framework in what we term QMLE, for Q-learning with maximum likelihood estimation. Our results show that QMLE can be applied to complex action spaces at a computational cost comparable to that of policy gradient methods, all without using policy gradients. Furthermore, QMLE exhibits strong performance on the DeepMind Control Suite, even when compared to state-of-the-art methods such as DMPO and D4PG.</description>

      <title>Learning by Surprise: Surplexity for Mitigating Model Collapse in Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As synthetic content increasingly infiltrates the web, generative AI models may be retrained on their own outputs: a process termed "autophagy". This leads to model collapse: a progressive loss of performance and diversity across generations. Recent studies have examined the emergence of model collapse across various generative AI models and data types, and have proposed mitigation strategies that rely on incorporating human-authored content. However, current characterizations of model collapse remain limited, and existing mitigation methods assume reliable knowledge of whether training data is human-authored or AI-generated. In this paper, we address these gaps by introducing new measures that characterise collapse directly from a model's next-token probability distributions, rather than from properties of AI-generated text. Using these measures, we show that the degree of collapse depends on the complexity of the initial training set, as well as on the extent of autophagy. Our experiments prompt a new suggestion: that model collapse occurs when a model trains on data that does not "surprise" it. We express this hypothesis in terms of the well-known Free Energy Principle in cognitive science. Building on this insight, we propose a practical mitigation strategy: filtering training items by high surplexity, maximising the surprise of the model. Unlike existing methods, this approach does not require distinguishing between human- and AI-generated data. Experiments across datasets and models demonstrate that our strategy is at least as effective as human-data baselines, and even more effective in reducing distributional skewedness. Our results provide a richer understanding of model collapse and point toward more resilient approaches for training generative AI systems in environments increasingly saturated with synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Dual Spatial-aware Generation of Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the visual spatial understanding (VSU) area, spatial image-to-text (SI2T) and spatial text-to-image (ST2I) are two fundamental tasks that appear in dual form. Existing methods for standalone SI2T or ST2I perform imperfectly in spatial understanding, due to the difficulty of 3D-wise spatial feature modeling. In this work, we consider modeling the SI2T and ST2I together under a dual learning framework. During the dual framework, we then propose to represent the 3D spatial scene features with a novel 3D scene graph (3DSG) representation that can be shared and beneficial to both tasks. Further, inspired by the intuition that the easier 3D$\to$image and 3D$\to$text processes also exist symmetrically in the ST2I and SI2T, respectively, we propose the Spatial Dual Discrete Diffusion (SD$^3$) framework, which utilizes the intermediate features of the 3D$\to$X processes to guide the hard X$\to$3D processes, such that the overall ST2I and SI2T will benefit each other. On the visual spatial understanding dataset VSD, our system outperforms the mainstream T2I and I2T methods significantly. Further in-depth analysis reveals how our dual learning strategy advances.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Kolmogorov Barrier: A Learnable Weighted Hybrid Autoencoder for Model Order Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18148v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</description>

      <title>ProMoE: Fast MoE-based LLM Serving using Proactive Caching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The promising applications of large language models are often limited by the constrained GPU memory capacity available on edge devices. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models help address this issue by activating only a subset of the model's parameters during computation. This approach allows the unused parameters to be offloaded to host memory, thereby reducing the overall GPU memory demand. However, existing cache-based offloading solutions handle cache misses reactively, which significantly impacts system performance. In this paper, we introduce ProMoE, a novel proactive caching system that utilizes intermediate results to predict subsequent expert usage. By proactively fetching experts in advance, ProMoE eliminates passive cache misses, removes loading time from the critical path, and reduces the performance overhead associated with offloading. Our evaluations demonstrate that ProMoE achieves an average speedup of 2.20x (up to 3.21x) and 2.07x (up to 5.02x) in the prefill and decode stages, respectively, compared to existing offloading solutions.</description>

      <title>Exploring Response Uncertainty in MLLMs: An Empirical Evaluation under Misleading Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on tasks ranging from visual question answering to video understanding. However, existing studies have concentrated mainly on visual-textual misalignment, leaving largely unexplored the MLLMs' ability to preserve an originally correct answer when confronted with misleading information. We reveal a response uncertainty phenomenon: across nine standard datasets, twelve state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs overturn a previously correct answer in 65% of cases after receiving a single deceptive cue. To systematically quantify this vulnerability, we propose a two-stage evaluation pipeline: (1) elicit each model's original response on unperturbed inputs; (2) inject explicit (false-answer hints) and implicit (contextual contradictions) misleading instructions, and compute the misleading rate - the fraction of correct-to-incorrect flips. Leveraging the most susceptible examples, we curate the Multimodal Uncertainty Benchmark (MUB), a collection of image-question pairs stratified into low, medium, and high difficulty based on how many of twelve state-of-the-art MLLMs they mislead. Extensive evaluation on twelve open-source and five closed-source models reveals a high uncertainty: average misleading rates exceed 86%, with explicit cues over 67.19% and implicit cues over 80.67%. To reduce the misleading rate, we then fine-tune all open-source MLLMs on a compact 2000-sample mixed-instruction dataset, reducing misleading rates to 6.97% (explicit) and 32.77% (implicit), boosting consistency by nearly 29.37% on highly deceptive inputs, and slightly improving accuracy on standard benchmarks.

      <title>A Computational Method for Measuring "Open Codes" in Qualitative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Qualitative analysis is critical to understanding human datasets in many social science disciplines. A central method in this process is inductive coding, where researchers identify and interpret codes directly from the datasets themselves. Yet, this exploratory approach poses challenges for meeting methodological expectations (such as ``depth'' and ``variation''), especially as researchers increasingly adopt Generative AI (GAI) for support. Ground-truth-based metrics are insufficient because they contradict the exploratory nature of inductive coding, while manual evaluation can be labor-intensive. This paper presents a theory-informed computational method for measuring inductive coding results from humans and GAI. Our method first merges individual codebooks using an LLM-enriched algorithm. It measures each coder's contribution against the merged result using four novel metrics: Coverage, Overlap, Novelty, and Divergence. Through two experiments on a human-coded online conversation dataset, we 1) reveal the merging algorithm's impact on metrics; 2) validate the metrics' stability and robustness across multiple runs and different LLMs; and 3) showcase the metrics' ability to diagnose coding issues, such as excessive or irrelevant (hallucinated) codes. Our work provides a reliable pathway for ensuring methodological rigor in human-AI qualitative analysis.</description>

      <title>From Intents to Conversations: Generating Intent-Driven Dialogues with Contrastive Learning for Multi-Turn Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14252v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In conversational AI systems, a critical challenge in training effective multi-turn intent classification models lies in the generation of large-scale, domain-specific, multilingual dialogue datasets. In this paper, we introduce Chain-of-Intent, a novel framework that integrates Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate intent-driven, context-aware dialogues through self-play. Our method first extracts domain-specific intent transition patterns from real-world e-commerce chat logs, which guide the modeling of turn-level dynamics and intent sequences. LLMs are then employed to parameterize the emission probabilities of HMMs, enabling the generation of natural, coherent utterances aligned with predicted intents and dialogue context. We also propose MINT-CL, a multi-task contrastive learning framework for multi-turn intent classification, which improves performance while reducing dependence on large-scale annotated datasets. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach outperforms competitive baselines in dialogue generation quality and classification accuracy, particularly in multilingual settings. To facilitate future research, we release MINT-E, a comprehensive, multilingual, intent-aware multi-turn dialogue corpus derived from the e-commerce domain\footnote{The reproduced source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/junhua/chain-of-intent.</description>

      <title>EFTViT: Efficient Federated Training of Vision Transformers with Masked Images on Resource-Constrained Clients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning research has recently shifted from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Vision Transformers (ViTs) due to their superior capacity. ViTs training demands higher computational resources due to the lack of 2D inductive biases inherent in CNNs. However, efficient federated training of ViTs on resource-constrained edge devices remains unexplored in the community. In this paper, we propose EFTViT, a hierarchical federated framework that leverages masked images to enable efficient, full-parameter training on resource-constrained edge devices, offering substantial benefits for learning on heterogeneous data. In general, we patchify images and randomly mask a portion of the patches, observing that excluding them from training has minimal impact on performance while substantially reducing computation costs and enhancing data content privacy protection. Specifically, EFTViT comprises a series of lightweight local modules and a larger global module, updated independently on clients and the central server, respectively. The local modules are trained on masked image patches, while the global module is trained on intermediate patch features uploaded from the local client, balanced through a proposed median sampling strategy to erase client data distribution privacy. We analyze the computational complexity and privacy protection of EFTViT. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that EFTViT achieves up to 28.17% accuracy improvement, reduces local training computational cost by up to 2.8$\times$, and cuts local training time by up to 4.4$\times$ compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning-Based Path Planning and Obstacle Avoidance Using PPO and B-Splines in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces SmartBSP, an advanced self-supervised learning framework for real-time path planning and obstacle avoidance in autonomous robotics navigating through complex environments. The proposed system integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Actor-Critic architecture to process limited LIDAR inputs and compute spatial decision-making probabilities. The robot's perceptual field is discretized into a grid format, which the CNN analyzes to produce a spatial probability distribution. During the training process a nuanced cost function is minimized that accounts for path curvature, endpoint proximity, and obstacle avoidance. Simulations results in different scenarios validate the algorithm's resilience and adaptability across diverse operational scenarios. Subsequently, Real-time experiments, employing the Robot Operating System (ROS), were carried out to assess the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Opportunities and Challenges of Large Language Models for Low-Resource Languages in Humanities Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-resource languages serve as invaluable repositories of human history, embodying cultural evolution and intellectual diversity. Despite their significance, these languages face critical challenges, including data scarcity and technological limitations, which hinder their comprehensive study and preservation. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer transformative opportunities for addressing these challenges, enabling innovative methodologies in linguistic, historical, and cultural research. This study systematically evaluates the applications of LLMs in low-resource language research, encompassing linguistic variation, historical documentation, cultural expressions, and literary analysis. By analyzing technical frameworks, current methodologies, and ethical considerations, this paper identifies key challenges such as data accessibility, model adaptability, and cultural sensitivity. Given the cultural, historical, and linguistic richness inherent in low-resource languages, this work emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration and the development of customized models as promising avenues for advancing research in this domain. By underscoring the potential of integrating artificial intelligence with the humanities to preserve and study humanity's linguistic and cultural heritage, this study fosters global efforts towards safeguarding intellectual diversity.</description>

      <title>PBI-Attack: Prior-Guided Bimodal Interactive Black-Box Jailbreak Attack for Toxicity Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05892v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the vulnerabilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) to jailbreak attacks is essential for their responsible real-world deployment. Most previous work requires access to model gradients, or is based on human knowledge (prompt engineering) to complete jailbreak, and they hardly consider the interaction of images and text, resulting in inability to jailbreak in black box scenarios or poor performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Prior-Guided Bimodal Interactive Black-Box Jailbreak Attack for toxicity maximization, referred to as PBI-Attack. Our method begins by extracting malicious features from a harmful corpus using an alternative LVLM and embedding these features into a benign image as prior information. Subsequently, we enhance these features through bidirectional cross-modal interaction optimization, which iteratively optimizes the bimodal perturbations in an alternating manner through greedy search, aiming to maximize the toxicity of the generated response. The toxicity level is quantified using a well-trained evaluation model. Experiments demonstrate that PBI-Attack outperforms previous state-of-the-art jailbreak methods, achieving an average attack success rate of 92.5% across three open-source LVLMs and around 67.3% on three closed-source LVLMs. Disclaimer: This paper contains potentially disturbing and offensive content.</description>

      <title>Skill-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning Acceleration from Heterogeneous Demonstrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a well-established problem in Reinforcement Learning (RL), which aims to facilitate rapid RL by leveraging expert demonstrations to pre-train the RL agent. However, the limited availability of expert demonstration data often hinders its ability to effectively aid downstream RL learning. To address this problem, we propose a novel two-stage method dubbed as Skill-enhanced Reinforcement Learning Acceleration (SeRLA). SeRLA introduces a skill-level adversarial Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning model that extracts useful skill prior knowledge by learning from both expert demonstrations and general low-cost demonstrations in the offline prior learning stage. Building on this, it employs a skill-based soft actor-critic algorithm to leverage the acquired priors for efficient training of a skill policy network in the downstream online RL stage. In addition, we propose a simple skill-level data enhancement technique to mitigate data sparsity and further improve both skill prior learning and skill policy training. Experiments across multiple standard RL benchmarks demonstrate that SeRLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in accelerating reinforcement learning on downstream tasks, particularly in the early training phase.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking LLMs for Mimicking Child-Caregiver Language in Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs can generate human-like dialogues, yet their ability to simulate early child-adult interactions remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we examined how effectively LLMs can capture the distinctive features of child-caregiver language in interaction, using both static and interactive benchmarking methods. We found that state-of-the-art LLMs like Llama 3 and GPT-4o can approximate child-caregiver dialogues at the word and utterance level, but they struggle to reproduce the child and caregiver's discursive patterns, exaggerate alignment, and fail to reach the level of diversity shown by humans. The broader goal of this work is to initiate the development of a comprehensive benchmark for LLMs in child-oriented applications.</description>

      <title>ViSymRe: Vision-guided Multimodal Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting simple mathematical expression from an observational dataset to describe complex natural phenomena is one of the core objectives of artificial intelligence (AI). This field is known as symbolic regression (SR). Traditional SR models are based on genetic programming (GP) or reinforcement learning (RL), facing well-known challenges, such as low efficiency and overfitting. Recent studies have integrated SR with large language models (LLMs), enabling fast zero-shot inference by learning mappings from millions of dataset-expression pairs. However, since the input and output are inherently different modalities, such models often struggle to converge effectively. In this paper, we introduce ViSymRe, a vision-guided multimodal SR model that incorporates the third resource, expression graph, to bridge the modality gap. Different from traditional multimodal models, ViSymRe is trained to extract vision, termed virtual vision, from datasets, without relying on the global availability of expression graphs, which addresses the essential challenge of visual SR, i.e., expression graphs are not available during inference. Evaluation results on multiple mainstream benchmarks show that ViSymRe achieves more competitive performance than the state-of-the-art dataset-only baselines. The expressions predicted by ViSymRe not only fit the dataset well but are also simple and structurally accurate, goals that SR models strive to achieve.</description>

      <title>APEX$^2$: Adaptive and Extreme Summarization for Personalized Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs), which store an extensive number of relational facts, serve various applications. Recently, personalized knowledge graphs (PKGs) have emerged as a solution to optimize storage costs by customizing their content to align with users' specific interests within particular domains. In the real world, on one hand, user queries and their underlying interests are inherently evolving, requiring PKGs to adapt continuously; on the other hand, the summarization is constantly expected to be as small as possible in terms of storage cost. However, the existing PKG summarization methods implicitly assume that the user's interests are constant and do not shift. Furthermore, when the size constraint of PKG is extremely small, the existing methods cannot distinguish which facts are more of immediate interest and guarantee the utility of the summarized PKG. To address these limitations, we propose APEX$^2$, a highly scalable PKG summarization framework designed with robust theoretical guarantees to excel in adaptive summarization tasks with extremely small size constraints. To be specific, after constructing an initial PKG, APEX$^2$ continuously tracks the interest shift and adjusts the previous summary. We evaluate APEX$^2$ under an evolving query setting on benchmark KGs containing up to 12 million triples, summarizing with compression ratios $\leq 0.1\%$. The experiments show that APEX outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both query-answering accuracy and efficiency.

      <description>arXiv:2412.20519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy learning from pre-collected offline datasets, relaxing the need to interact directly with the environment. However, limited by the quality of offline datasets, it generally fails to learn well-qualified policies in suboptimal datasets. To address datasets with insufficient optimal demonstrations, we introduce Goal-cOnditioned Data Augmentation (GODA), a novel goal-conditioned diffusion-based method for augmenting samples with higher quality. Leveraging recent advancements in generative modelling, GODA incorporates a novel return-oriented goal condition with various selection mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce a controllable scaling technique to provide enhanced return-based guidance during data sampling. GODA learns a comprehensive distribution representation of the original offline datasets while generating new data with selectively higher-return goals, thereby maximizing the utility of limited optimal demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose a novel adaptive gated conditioning method for processing noisy inputs and conditions, enhancing the capture of goal-oriented guidance. We conduct experiments on the D4RL benchmark and real-world challenges, specifically traffic signal control (TSC) tasks, to demonstrate GODA's effectiveness in enhancing data quality and superior performance compared to state-of-the-art data augmentation methods across various offline RL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Multimodal LLMs Can Reason about Aesthetics in Zero-Shot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid technical progress of generative art (GenArt) has democratized the creation of visually appealing imagery. However, achieving genuine artistic impact - the kind that resonates with viewers on a deeper, more meaningful level - remains formidable as it requires a sophisticated aesthetic sensibility. This sensibility involves a multifaceted cognitive process extending beyond mere visual appeal, which is often overlooked by current computational methods. This paper pioneers an approach to capture this complex process by investigating how the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) can be effectively elicited to perform aesthetic judgment. Our analysis reveals a critical challenge: MLLMs exhibit a tendency towards hallucinations during aesthetic reasoning, characterized by subjective opinions and unsubstantiated artistic interpretations. We further demonstrate that these hallucinations can be suppressed by employing an evidence-based and objective reasoning process, as substantiated by our proposed baseline, ArtCoT. MLLMs prompted by this principle produce multifaceted, in-depth aesthetic reasoning that aligns significantly better with human judgment. These findings have direct applications in areas such as AI art tutoring and as reward models for image generation. Ultimately, we hope this work paves the way for AI systems that can truly understand, appreciate, and contribute to art that aligns with human aesthetic values.

      <title>BloomScene: Lightweight Structured 3D Gaussian Splatting for Crossmodal Scene Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the widespread use of virtual reality applications, 3D scene generation has become a new challenging research frontier. 3D scenes have highly complex structures and need to ensure that the output is dense, coherent, and contains all necessary structures. Many current 3D scene generation methods rely on pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models and monocular depth estimators. However, the generated scenes occupy large amounts of storage space and often lack effective regularisation methods, leading to geometric distortions. To this end, we propose BloomScene, a lightweight structured 3D Gaussian splatting for crossmodal scene generation, which creates diverse and high-quality 3D scenes from text or image inputs. Specifically, a crossmodal progressive scene generation framework is proposed to generate coherent scenes utilizing incremental point cloud reconstruction and 3D Gaussian splatting. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical depth prior-based regularization mechanism that utilizes multi-level constraints on depth accuracy and smoothness to enhance the realism and continuity of the generated scenes. Ultimately, we propose a structured context-guided compression mechanism that exploits structured hash grids to model the context of unorganized anchor attributes, which significantly eliminates structural redundancy and reduces storage overhead. Comprehensive experiments across multiple scenes demonstrate the significant potential and advantages of our framework compared with several baselines.</description>

      <title>FL-CLEANER: byzantine and backdoor defense by CLustering Errors of Activation maps in Non-iid fedErated leaRning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables clients to collaboratively train a global model using their local datasets while reinforcing data privacy, but it is prone to poisoning attacks. Existing defense mechanisms assume that clients' data are independent and identically distributed (IID), making them ineffective in real-world applications where data are non-IID. This paper presents FL-CLEANER, the first defense capable of filtering both byzantine and backdoor attackers' model updates in a non-IID FL environment. The originality of FL-CLEANER is twofold. First, it relies on a client confidence score derived from the reconstruction errors of each client's model activation maps for a given trigger set, with reconstruction errors obtained by means of a Conditional Variational Autoencoder trained according to a novel server-side strategy. Second, it uses an original ad-hoc trust propagation algorithm we propose. Based on previous client scores, it allows building a cluster of benign clients while flagging potential attackers. Experimental results on the datasets MNIST and FashionMNIST demonstrate the efficiency of FL-CLEANER against Byzantine attackers as well as to some state-of-the-art backdoors in non-IID scenarios; it achieves a close-to-zero (&lt;1%) benign client misclassification rate, even in the absence of an attack, and achieves strong performance compared to state of the art defenses.</description>

      <title>Temporal Preference Optimization for Long-Form Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in video large multimodal models (video-LMMs), achieving effective temporal grounding in long-form videos remains a challenge for existing models. To address this limitation, we propose Temporal Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel post-training framework designed to enhance the temporal grounding capabilities of video-LMMs through preference learning. TPO adopts a self-training approach that enables models to differentiate between well-grounded and less accurate temporal responses by leveraging curated preference datasets at two granularities: localized temporal grounding, which focuses on specific video segments, and comprehensive temporal grounding, which captures extended temporal dependencies across entire video sequences. By optimizing on these preference datasets, TPO significantly enhances temporal understanding while reducing reliance on manually annotated data. Extensive experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks--LongVideoBench, MLVU, and Video-MME--demonstrate the effectiveness of TPO across two state-of-the-art video-LMMs. Notably, LLaVA-Video-TPO establishes itself as the leading 7B model on the Video-MME benchmark, underscoring the potential of TPO as a scalable and efficient solution for advancing temporal reasoning in long-form video understanding.

      <title>Vision without Images: End-to-End Computer Vision from Single Compressive Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Snapshot Compressed Imaging (SCI) offers high-speed, low-bandwidth, and energy-efficient image acquisition, but remains challenged by low-light and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Moreover, practical hardware constraints in high-resolution sensors limit the use of large frame-sized masks, necessitating smaller, hardware-friendly designs. In this work, we present a novel SCI-based computer vision framework using pseudo-random binary masks of only 8$\times$8 in size for physically feasible implementations. At its core is CompDAE, a Compressive Denoising Autoencoder built on the STFormer architecture, designed to perform downstream tasks--such as edge detection and depth estimation--directly from noisy compressive raw pixel measurements without image reconstruction. CompDAE incorporates a rate-constrained training strategy inspired by BackSlash to promote compact, compressible models. A shared encoder paired with lightweight task-specific decoders enables a unified multi-task platform. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that CompDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly lower complexity, especially under ultra-low-light conditions where traditional CMOS and SCI pipelines fail.</description>

      <title>Distilling Large Language Models for Network Active Queue Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing complexity of network traffic and demand for ultra-low latency communication require smarter packet traffic management. Existing Deep Learning-based queuing approaches struggle with dynamic network scenarios and demand high engineering effort. We propose AQM-LLM, distilling Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot learning, contextual understanding, and pattern recognition to improve Active Queue Management (AQM) [RFC 9330] with minimal manual effort. We consider a specific case where AQM is Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S) and our design of AQM-LLM builds on speculative decoding and reinforcement-based distilling of LLM by tackling congestion prevention in the L4S architecture using Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [RFC 9331] and periodic packet dropping. We develop a new open-source experimental platform by executing L4S-AQM on FreeBSD-14, providing interoperable modules to support LLM integration and facilitate IETF recognition through wider testing. Our extensive evaluations show L4S-LLM enhances queue management, prevents congestion, reduces latency, and boosts network performance, showcasing LLMs' adaptability and efficiency in uplifting AQM systems.</description>

      <title>DesCLIP: Robust Continual Learning via General Attribute Descriptions for VLM-Based Visual Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continual learning of vision-language models (VLMs) focuses on leveraging cross-modal pretrained knowledge to incrementally adapt to expanding downstream tasks and datasets, while tackling the challenge of knowledge forgetting. Existing research often focuses on connecting visual features with specific class text in downstream tasks, overlooking the latent relationships between general and specialized knowledge. Our findings reveal that forcing models to optimize inappropriate visual-text matches exacerbates forgetting of VLM's recognition ability. To tackle this issue, we propose DesCLIP, which leverages general attribute (GA) descriptions to guide the understanding of specific class objects, enabling VLMs to establish robust vision-GA-class trilateral associations rather than relying solely on vision-class connections. Specifically, we introduce a language assistant to generate concrete GA description candidates via proper request prompts. Then, an anchor-based embedding filter is designed to obtain highly relevant GA description embeddings, which are leveraged as the paired text embeddings for visual-textual instance matching, thereby tuning the visual encoder. Correspondingly, the class text embeddings are gradually calibrated to align with these shared GA description embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advancements and efficacy of our proposed method, with comprehensive empirical evaluations highlighting its superior performance in VLM-based recognition compared to existing continual learning methods.</description>

      <title>VIKSER: Visual Knowledge-Driven Self-Reinforcing Reasoning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual reasoning refers to the task of solving questions about visual information. Current visual reasoning methods typically employ pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) strategies or deep neural network approaches. However, existing efforts are constrained by limited reasoning interpretability, while hindering by the phenomenon of underspecification in the question text. Additionally, the absence of fine-grained visual knowledge limits the precise understanding of subject behavior in visual reasoning tasks. To address these issues, we propose VIKSER (Visual Knowledge-Driven Self-Reinforcing Reasoning Framework). Specifically, VIKSER, trained using knowledge distilled from large language models, extracts fine-grained visual knowledge with the assistance of visual relationship detection techniques. Subsequently, VIKSER utilizes fine-grained visual knowledge to paraphrase the question with underspecification. Additionally, we design a novel prompting method called Chain-of-Evidence (CoE), which leverages the power of "evidence for reasoning" to endow VIKSER with interpretable reasoning capabilities. Meanwhile, the integration of self-reflection technology empowers VIKSER with the ability to learn and improve from its mistakes. Experiments conducted on widely used datasets demonstrate that VIKSER achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in relevant tasks. Moreover, VIKSER achieves performance on par with leading proprietary models, such as the latest ChatGPT-5.</description>

      <title>Token Assorted: Mixing Latent and Text Tokens for Improved Language Model Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and planning when trained on chainof-thought (CoT) data, where the step-by-step thought process is explicitly outlined by text tokens. However, this results in lengthy inputs where many words support textual coherence rather than core reasoning information, and processing these inputs consumes substantial computation resources. In this work, we propose a hybrid representation of the reasoning process, where we partially abstract away the initial reasoning steps using latent discrete tokens generated by VQ-VAE, significantly reducing the length of reasoning traces. We explore the use of latent trace abstractions in two scenarios: 1) training the model from scratch for the Keys-Finding Maze problem, 2) fine-tuning LLMs on this hybrid data with an extended vocabulary including unseen latent tokens, for both logical and mathematical reasoning problems. To facilitate effective learning, we introduce a simple training procedure that randomly mixes latent and text tokens, which enables fast adaptation to new latent tokens. Our approach consistently outperforms the baselines methods in various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Learning Sparse Superposed Features with Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05407v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of deep networks is crucially attributed to their ability to capture latent features within a representation space. In this work, we investigate whether the underlying learned features of a model can be efficiently retrieved through feedback from an agent, such as a large language model (LLM), in the form of relative \tt{triplet comparisons}. These features may represent various constructs, including dictionaries in LLMs or a covariance matrix of Mahalanobis distances. We analyze the feedback complexity associated with learning a feature matrix in sparse settings. Our results establish tight bounds when the agent is permitted to construct activations and demonstrate strong upper bounds in sparse scenarios when the agent's feedback is limited to distributional information. We validate our theoretical findings through experiments on two distinct applications: feature recovery from Recursive Feature Machines and dictionary extraction from sparse autoencoders trained on Large Language Models.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Vision Models for Time Series Analysis: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series analysis has witnessed the inspiring development from traditional autoregressive models, deep learning models, to recent Transformers and Large Language Models (LLMs). Efforts in leveraging vision models for time series analysis have also been made along the way but are less visible to the community due to the predominant research on sequence modeling in this domain. However, the discrepancy between continuous time series and the discrete token space of LLMs, and the challenges in explicitly modeling the correlations of variates in multivariate time series have shifted some research attentions to the equally successful Large Vision Models (LVMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). To fill the blank in the existing literature, this survey discusses the advantages of vision models over LLMs in time series analysis. It provides a comprehensive and in-depth overview of the existing methods, with dual views of detailed taxonomy that answer the key research questions including how to encode time series as images and how to model the imaged time series for various tasks. Additionally, we address the challenges in the pre- and post-processing steps involved in this framework and outline future directions to further advance time series analysis with vision models.</description>

      <title>RAMer: Reconstruction-based Adversarial Model for Multi-party Multi-modal Multi-label Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional Multi-modal multi-label emotion recognition (MMER) assumes complete access to visual, textual, and acoustic modalities. However, real-world multi-party settings often violate this assumption, as non-speakers frequently lack acoustic and textual inputs, leading to a significant degradation in model performance. Existing approaches also tend to unify heterogeneous modalities into a single representation, overlooking each modality's unique characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose RAMer (Reconstruction-based Adversarial Model for Emotion Recognition), which refines multi-modal representations by not only exploring modality commonality and specificity but crucially by leveraging reconstructed features, enhanced by contrastive learning, to overcome data incompleteness and enrich feature quality. RAMer also introduces a personality auxiliary task to complement missing modalities using modality-level attention, improving emotion reasoning. To further strengthen the model's ability to capture label and modality interdependency, we propose a stack shuffle strategy to enrich correlations between labels and modality-specific features. Experiments on three benchmarks, i.e., MEmoR, CMU-MOSEI, and $M^3ED$, demonstrate that RAMer achieves state-of-the-art performance in dyadic and multi-party MMER scenarios.</description>

      <title>NeuroAMP: A Novel End-to-end General Purpose Deep Neural Amplifier for Personalized Hearing Aids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prevalence of hearing aids is increasing. However, optimizing the amplification processes of hearing aids remains challenging due to the complexity of integrating multiple modular components in traditional methods. To address this challenge, we present NeuroAMP, a novel deep neural network designed for end-to-end, personalized amplification in hearing aids. NeuroAMP leverages both spectral features and the listener's audiogram as inputs, and we investigate four architectures: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN), and Transformer. We also introduce Denoising NeuroAMP, an extension that integrates noise reduction along with amplification capabilities for improved performance in real-world scenarios. To enhance generalization, a comprehensive data augmentation strategy was employed during training on diverse speech (TIMIT and TMHINT) and music (Cadenza Challenge MUSIC) datasets. Evaluation using the Hearing Aid Speech Perception Index (HASPI), Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index (HASQI), and Hearing Aid Audio Quality Index (HAAQI) demonstrates that the Transformer architecture within NeuroAMP achieves the best performance, with SRCC scores of 0.9927 (HASQI) and 0.9905 (HASPI) on TIMIT, and 0.9738 (HAAQI) on the Cadenza Challenge MUSIC dataset. Notably, our data augmentation strategy maintains high performance on unseen datasets (e.g., VCTK, MUSDB18-HQ). Furthermore, Denoising NeuroAMP outperforms both the conventional NAL-R+WDRC approach and a two-stage baseline on the VoiceBank+DEMAND dataset, achieving a 10% improvement in both HASPI (0.90) and HASQI (0.59) scores. These results highlight the potential of NeuroAMP and Denoising NeuroAMP to deliver notable improvements in personalized hearing aid amplification.</description>

      <title>Rotate, Clip, and Partition: Towards W2A4KV4 Quantization by Integrating Rotation and Learnable Non-uniform Quantizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Rotate, Clip, and Partition (RCP), a quantization-aware training (QAT) approach that first realizes extreme compression of LLMs with W2A4KV4(2-bit weight, 4-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache) configuration. RCP integrates recent rotation techniques with a novel non-uniform weight quantizer design, by quantitatively analyzing the impact of random rotation on 2-bit weight quantization. Our weight quantizer features Learnable Direct Partitioning (LDP), which introduces learnable parameters to directly learn non-uniform intervals jointly with LLM weights. We also present a specialized GPU kernel that supports GEMV on non-uniform W2A4. Experiments show that RCP can compress LLaMA-2-7B to W2A4KV4 with a loss of only 2.84 WikiText2 ppl and 5.29 times reduced memory footprint. Furthermore, RCP can quantize challenging mobile-targeted LLaMA-3.2 models and domain-specific WizardCoder-7B and MetaMath-7B with no critical problems such as convergence failure and repetition.

      <title>A Gap Between the Gaussian RKHS and Neural Networks: An Infinite-Center Asymptotic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works have characterized the function-space inductive bias of infinite-width bounded-norm single-hidden-layer neural networks as a kind of bounded-variation-type space. This novel neural network Banach space encompasses many classical multivariate function spaces, including certain Sobolev spaces and the spectral Barron spaces. Notably, this Banach space also includes functions that exhibit less classical regularity, such as those that only vary in a few directions. On bounded domains, it is well-established that the Gaussian reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) strictly embeds into this Banach space, demonstrating a clear gap between the Gaussian RKHS and the neural network Banach space. It turns out that when investigating these spaces on unbounded domains, e.g., all of $\mathbb{R}^d$, the story is fundamentally different. We establish the following fundamental result: Certain functions that lie in the Gaussian RKHS have infinite norm in the neural network Banach space. This provides a nontrivial gap between kernel methods and neural networks by exhibiting functions that kernel methods easily represent, whereas neural networks cannot.</description>

      <title>Multilingual != Multicultural: Evaluating Gaps Between Multilingual Capabilities and Cultural Alignment in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable across global languages. However, the ability to communicate across languages does not necessarily translate to appropriate cultural representations. A key concern is US-centric bias, where LLMs reflect US rather than local cultural values. We propose a novel methodology that compares LLM-generated response distributions against population-level opinion data from the World Value Survey across four languages (Danish, Dutch, English, and Portuguese). Using a rigorous linear mixed-effects regression framework, we compare two families of models: Google's Gemma models (2B--27B parameters) and successive iterations of OpenAI's turbo-series. Across the families of models, we find no consistent relationships between language capabilities and cultural alignment. While the Gemma models have a positive correlation between language capability and cultural alignment across languages, the OpenAI models do not. Importantly, we find that self-consistency is a stronger predictor of multicultural alignment than multilingual capabilities. Our results demonstrate that achieving meaningful cultural alignment requires dedicated effort beyond improving general language capabilities.</description>

      <title>Automatic Input Rewriting Improves Translation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16682v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can we improve machine translation (MT) with LLMs by rewriting their inputs automatically? Users commonly rely on the intuition that well-written text is easier to translate when using off-the-shelf MT systems. LLMs can rewrite text in many ways but in the context of MT, these capabilities have been primarily exploited to rewrite outputs via post-editing. We present an empirical study of 21 input rewriting methods with 3 open-weight LLMs for translating from English into 6 target languages. We show that text simplification is the most effective MT-agnostic rewrite strategy and that it can be improved further when using quality estimation to assess translatability. Human evaluation further confirms that simplified rewrites and their MT outputs both largely preserve the original meaning of the source and MT. These results suggest LLM-assisted input rewriting as a promising direction for improving translations.</description>

      <title>Agent Trading Arena: A Study on Numerical Understanding in LLM-Based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language tasks, yet their performance in dynamic, real-world financial environments remains underexplored. Existing approaches are limited to historical backtesting, where trading actions cannot influence market prices and agents train only on static data. To address this limitation, we present the Agent Trading Arena, a virtual zero-sum stock market in which LLM-based agents engage in competitive multi-agent trading and directly impact price dynamics. By simulating realistic bid-ask interactions, our platform enables training in scenarios that closely mirror live markets, thereby narrowing the gap between training and evaluation. Experiments reveal that LLMs struggle with numerical reasoning when given plain-text data, often overfitting to local patterns and recent values. In contrast, chart-based visualizations significantly enhance both numerical reasoning and trading performance. Furthermore, incorporating a reflection module yields additional improvements, especially with visual inputs. Evaluations on NASDAQ and CSI datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, particularly under high volatility. All code and data are available at https://github.com/wekjsdvnm/Agent-Trading-Arena.</description>

      <title>RewardDS: Privacy-Preserving Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models via Reward Driven Data Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) has attracted many individuals to fine-tune them for domain-specific tasks by uploading their data. However, in sensitive areas like healthcare and finance, privacy concerns often arise. One promising solution is to generate synthetic data with Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees to replace private data. However, these synthetic data contain significant flawed data, which are considered as noise. Existing solutions typically rely on naive filtering by comparing ROUGE-L scores or embedding similarities, which are ineffective in addressing the noise. To address this issue, we propose \textit{RewardDS}, a novel privacy-preserving framework that fine-tunes a reward proxy model and uses reward signals to guide the synthetic data generation. Our \textit{RewardDS} introduces two key modules, Reward Guided Filtering and Self-Optimizing Refinement, to both filter and refine the synthetic data, effectively mitigating the noise. Extensive experiments across medical, financial, and code generation domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>A Causal Lens for Evaluating Faithfulness Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer natural language explanations as an alternative to feature attribution methods for model interpretability. However, despite their plausibility, they may not reflect the model's true reasoning faithfully, which is crucial for understanding the model's true decision-making processes. Although several faithfulness metrics have been proposed, they are often evaluated in isolation, making direct, principled comparisons between them difficult. Here, we present Causal Diagnosticity, a framework that serves as a common testbed to evaluate faithfulness metrics for natural language explanations. Our framework employs the concept of diagnosticity, and uses model-editing methods to generate faithful-unfaithful explanation pairs. Our benchmark includes four tasks: fact-checking, analogy, object counting, and multi-hop reasoning. We evaluate prominent faithfulness metrics, including post-hoc explanation and chain-of-thought-based methods. We find that diagnostic performance varies across tasks and models, with Filler Tokens performing best overall. Additionally, continuous metrics are generally more diagnostic than binary ones but can be sensitive to noise and model choice. Our results highlight the need for more robust faithfulness metrics.</description>

      <title>Sim-to-Real Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Based Dexterous Manipulation on Humanoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning generalizable robot manipulation policies, especially for complex multi-fingered humanoids, remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on extensive data collection and imitation learning, which are expensive, labor-intensive, and difficult to scale. Sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative, but has mostly succeeded in simpler state-based or single-hand setups. How to effectively extend this to vision-based, contact-rich bimanual manipulation tasks remains an open question. In this paper, we introduce a practical sim-to-real RL recipe that trains a humanoid robot to perform three challenging dexterous manipulation tasks: grasp-and-reach, box lift and bimanual handover. Our method features an automated real-to-sim tuning module, a generalized reward formulation based on contact and object goals, a divide-and-conquer policy distillation framework, and a hybrid object representation strategy with modality-specific augmentation. We demonstrate high success rates on unseen objects and robust, adaptive policy behaviors -- highlighting that vision-based dexterous manipulation via sim-to-real RL is not only viable, but also scalable and broadly applicable to real-world humanoid manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Robust Deterministic Policy Gradient for Disturbance Attenuation and Its Application to Quadrotor Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21057v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Practical control systems pose significant challenges in identifying optimal control policies due to uncertainties in the system model and external disturbances. While $H_\infty$ control techniques are commonly used to design robust controllers that mitigate the effects of disturbances, these methods often require complex and computationally intensive calculations. To address this issue, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning algorithm called Robust Deterministic Policy Gradient (RDPG), which formulates the $H_\infty$ control problem as a two-player zero-sum dynamic game. In this formulation, one player (the user) aims to minimize the cost, while the other player (the adversary) seeks to maximize it. We then employ deterministic policy gradient (DPG) and its deep reinforcement learning counterpart to train a robust control policy with effective disturbance attenuation. In particular, for practical implementation, we introduce an algorithm called robust deep deterministic policy gradient (RDDPG), which employs a deep neural network architecture and integrates techniques from the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) to enhance stability and learning efficiency. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we implement it on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tasked with following a predefined path in a disturbance-prone environment. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other control approaches in terms of robustness against disturbances, enabling precise real-time tracking of moving targets even under severe disturbance conditions.</description>

      <title>MOHPER: Multi-objective Hyperparameter Optimization Framework for E-commerce Retrieval System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: E-commerce search optimization has evolved to include a wider range of metrics that reflect user engagement and business objectives. Modern search frameworks now incorporate advanced quality features, such as sales counts and document-query relevance, to better align search results with these goals. Traditional methods typically focus on click-through rate (CTR) as a measure of engagement or relevance, but this can miss true purchase intent, creating a gap between user interest and actual conversions. Joint training with the click-through conversion rate (CTCVR) has become essential for understanding buying behavior, although its sparsity poses challenges for reliable optimization. This study presents MOHPER, a Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization framework for E-commerce Retrieval systems. Utilizing Bayesian optimization and sampling, it jointly optimizes both CTR, CTCVR, and relevant objectives, focusing on engagement and conversion of the users. In addition, to improve the selection of the best configuration from multi-objective optimization, we suggest advanced methods for hyperparameter selection, including a meta-configuration voting strategy and a cumulative training approach that leverages prior optimal configurations, to improve speeds of training and efficiency. Currently deployed in a live setting, our proposed framework substantiates its practical efficacy in achieving a balanced optimization that aligns with both user satisfaction and revenue goals.</description>

      <title>To See a World in a Spark of Neuron: Disentangling Multi-task Interference for Training-free Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained models on targeted datasets enhances task-specific performance but often comes at the expense of generalization. Model merging techniques, which integrate multiple fine-tuned models into a single multi-task model through task arithmetic, offer a promising solution. However, task interference remains a fundamental challenge, leading to performance degradation and suboptimal merged models. Existing approaches largely overlooked the fundamental roles of neurons, their connectivity, and activation, resulting in a merging process and a merged model that does not consider how neurons relay and process information. In this work, we present the first study that relies on neuronal mechanisms for model merging. Specifically, we decomposed task-specific representations into two complementary neuronal subspaces that regulate input sensitivity and task adaptability. Leveraging this decomposition, we introduced NeuroMerging, a novel merging framework developed to mitigate task interference within neuronal subspaces, enabling training-free model fusion across diverse tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that NeuroMerging achieved superior performance compared to existing methods on multi-task benchmarks across both natural language and vision domains. Our findings highlighted the importance of aligning neuronal mechanisms in model merging, offering new insights into mitigating task interference and improving knowledge fusion.

      <title>Open-World Skill Discovery from Unsegmented Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning skills in open-world environments is essential for developing agents capable of handling a variety of tasks by combining basic skills. Online demonstration videos are typically long but unsegmented, making them difficult to segment and label with skill identifiers. Unlike existing methods that rely on sequence sampling or human labeling, we have developed a self-supervised learning-based approach to segment these long videos into a series of semantic-aware and skill-consistent segments. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive event segmentation theory, we introduce Skill Boundary Detection (SBD), an annotation-free temporal video segmentation algorithm. SBD detects skill boundaries in a video by leveraging prediction errors from a pretrained unconditional action-prediction model. This approach is based on the assumption that a significant increase in prediction error indicates a shift in the skill being executed. We evaluated our method in Minecraft, a rich open-world simulator with extensive gameplay videos available online. Our SBD-generated segments improved the average performance of conditioned policies by 63.7% and 52.1% on short-term atomic skill tasks, and their corresponding hierarchical agents by 11.3% and 20.8% on long-horizon tasks. Our method can leverage the diverse YouTube videos to train instruction-following agents. The project page can be found in https://craftjarvis.github.io/SkillDiscovery.</description>

      <title>General Table Question Answering via Answer-Formula Joint Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advanced table question answering (TableQA) methods prompt large language models (LLMs) to generate answer text, SQL query, Python code, or custom operation, which impressively improve the complex reasoning problems in the TableQA task. However, these methods lack the versatility to cope with specific question types or table structures. In contrast, the Spreadsheet Formula, the widely used and well-defined operation language for tabular data, has not been thoroughly explored to solve TableQA. In this paper, we first attempt to use the Formula as the executable representation for solving complex reasoning on tables with different structures. Specifically, we construct \texttt{FromulaQA}, a large Formula-annotated TableQA dataset from existing datasets. In addition, we propose \texttt{TabAF}, a general table answering framework to solve multiple types of tasks over multiple types of tables simultaneously, which decodes answers and Formulas with a single LLM backbone. Extensive experiments demonstrate the versatility and generalization of \texttt{TabAF}. Under the same model size, \texttt{TabAF} achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the WikiTableQuestion, HiTab, and TabFact.</description>

      <title>Unmasking Deceptive Visuals: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models on Misleading Chart Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18172v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Misleading visualizations, which manipulate chart representations to support specific claims, can distort perception and lead to incorrect conclusions. Despite decades of research, they remain a widespread issue-posing risks to public understanding and raising safety concerns for AI systems involved in data-driven communication. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong chart comprehension abilities, their capacity to detect and interpret misleading charts remains unexplored. We introduce Misleading ChartQA benchmark, a large-scale multimodal dataset designed to evaluate MLLMs on misleading chart reasoning. It contains 3,026 curated examples spanning 21 misleader types and 10 chart types, each with standardized chart code, CSV data, multiple-choice questions, and labeled explanations, validated through iterative MLLM checks and exhausted expert human review. We benchmark 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs, analyze their performance across misleader types and chart formats, and propose a novel region-aware reasoning pipeline that enhances model accuracy. Our work lays the foundation for developing MLLMs that are robust, trustworthy, and aligned with the demands of responsible visual communication.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Breast Cancer Detection in Mammograms: A Comprehensive Study of Transfer Learning, Resolution Reduction, and Multi-View Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mammography, an X-ray-based imaging technique, plays a crucial role in the early detection of breast cancer. Its accuracy heavily depends on expert radiologists, making it essential to minimize interpretation errors. To support radiologists, various computer-aided detection and diagnostic methods have been proposed, increasingly leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Over recent years, mammogram analysis has evolved significantly - from early patch-based classifiers, which examine only localized regions of images, to full-image classifiers, and later towards multi-view systems that simultaneously integrate multiple perspectives of the mammographic exam for enhanced accuracy. Despite this progression, critical questions remain, such as whether multi-view systems consistently outperform single-view approaches. In this paper, we systematically evaluate and compare the effectiveness of single-view and multi-view mammogram classification techniques. Our research introduces models that achieve superior performance relative to existing state-of-the-art approaches in both single-view and two-view classification scenarios. Furthermore, our findings provide valuable insights into optimal model architectures and effective transfer learning strategies, paving the way for more accurate and efficient mammogram interpretation. The inference code and model are available at https://github.com/dpetrini/multiple-view.</description>

      <title>Flip Learning: Weakly Supervised Erase to Segment Nodules in Breast Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of nodules in both 2D breast ultrasound (BUS) and 3D automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Therefore, developing an automated system for nodule segmentation can enhance user independence and expedite clinical analysis. Unlike fully-supervised learning, weakly-supervised segmentation (WSS) can streamline the laborious and intricate annotation process. However, current WSS methods face challenges in achieving precise nodule segmentation, as many of them depend on inaccurate activation maps or inefficient pseudo-mask generation algorithms. In this study, we introduce a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning-based WSS framework called Flip Learning, which relies solely on 2D/3D boxes for accurate segmentation. Specifically, multiple agents are employed to erase the target from the box to facilitate classification tag flipping, with the erased region serving as the predicted segmentation mask. The key contributions of this research are as follows: (1) Adoption of a superpixel/supervoxel-based approach to encode the standardized environment, capturing boundary priors and expediting the learning process. (2) Introduction of three meticulously designed rewards, comprising a classification score reward and two intensity distribution rewards, to steer the agents' erasing process precisely, thereby avoiding both under- and over-segmentation. (3) Implementation of a progressive curriculum learning strategy to enable agents to interact with the environment in a progressively challenging manner, thereby enhancing learning efficiency. Extensively validated on the large in-house BUS and ABUS datasets, our Flip Learning method outperforms state-of-the-art WSS methods and foundation models, and achieves comparable performance as fully-supervised learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>LATTE-MV: Learning to Anticipate Table Tennis Hits from Monocular Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical agility is a necessary skill in competitive table tennis, but by no means sufficient. Champions excel in this fast-paced and highly dynamic environment by anticipating their opponent's intent - buying themselves the necessary time to react. In this work, we take one step towards designing such an anticipatory agent. Previous works have developed systems capable of real-time table tennis gameplay, though they often do not leverage anticipation. Among the works that forecast opponent actions, their approaches are limited by dataset size and variety. Our paper contributes (1) a scalable system for reconstructing monocular video of table tennis matches in 3D and (2) an uncertainty-aware controller that anticipates opponent actions. We demonstrate in simulation that our policy improves the ball return rate against high-speed hits from 49.9% to 59.0% as compared to a baseline non-anticipatory policy.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the Entropy Driven Uncertainty Process Reward Model (EDU-PRM), a novel entropy-driven training framework for process reward modeling that enables dynamic, uncertainty-aligned segmentation of complex reasoning steps, eliminating the need for costly manual step annotations. Unlike previous Process Reward Models (PRMs) that rely on static partitioning and human labeling, EDU-PRM automatically anchors step boundaries at tokens with high predictive entropy. On the MATH test set, EDU-PRM achieves 65.5% accuracy, surpassing strong public PRM baselines such as Math-Shepherd PRM (61.7%) and Omega PRM (62.4%) under the High Temperature (HT) Sample + BON setting. Furthermore, when replacing HT sampling with EDU sampling, EDU-PRM further improves both accuracy and efficiency: at N=64, accuracy increases from 64.7% (HT Sample + BON) to 67.3% (EDU Sample + BON), while the number of generated tokens is reduced by 47%, demonstrating a superior accuracy-cost balance. On the ProcessBench test set, EDU-PRM achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 88.4% using less than 1.5% of the Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B training data, surpassing the previous best of 87.8%. In summary, EDU-PRM provides a scalable and annotation-efficient paradigm for process supervision in mathematical reasoning, opening new avenues for efficient complex reasoning on math.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Fully Convolutional CNN-Transformer Model for Inherently Interpretable Disease Detection from Retinal Fundus Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08481v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many medical imaging tasks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) efficiently extract local features hierarchically. More recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have gained popularity, using self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies, but lacking the inherent spatial localization of convolutions. Therefore, hybrid models combining CNNs and ViTs have been developed to combine the strengths of both architectures. However, such hybrid models are difficult to interpret, which hinders their application in medical imaging. In this work, we introduce an interpretable-by-design hybrid fully convolutional CNN-Transformer architecture for retinal disease detection. Unlike widely used post-hoc saliency methods for ViTs, our approach generates faithful and localized evidence maps that directly reflect the mode's decision process. We evaluated our method on two medical tasks focused on disease detection using color fundus images. Our model achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance compared to black-box and interpretable models and provides class-specific sparse evidence maps in a single forward pass. The code is available at: https://github.com/kdjoumessi/Self-Explainable-CNN-Transformer.</description>

      <title>Agent-Q: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Quantum Circuit Generation and Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable outcomes in complex problems, including math, coding, and analyzing large amounts of scientific reports. Yet, few works have explored the potential of LLMs in quantum computing. The most challenging problem is to leverage LLMs to automatically generate quantum circuits at a large scale. Fundamentally, the existing pre-trained LLMs lack the knowledge of quantum circuits. In this paper, we address this challenge by fine-tuning LLMs and injecting the domain-specific knowledge of quantum computing. We describe Agent-Q, an LLM fine-tuning system to generate and optimize quantum circuits. In particular, Agent-Q implements the mechanisms to generate training data sets and constructs an end-to-end pipeline to fine-tune pre-trained LLMs to generate parameterized quantum circuits for various optimization problems. Agent-Q provides 14,000 quantum circuits covering a large spectrum of the quantum optimization landscape: 12 optimization problem instances and their optimized QAOA, VQE, and adaptive VQE circuits. Based thereon, Agent-Q fine-tunes LLMs and constructs syntactically correct parametrized quantum circuits in OpenQASM 3.0. We have evaluated the quality of the LLM-generated circuits and parameters by comparing them to the optimized expectation values and distributions. Experimental results show superior performance of Agent-Q, compared to several state-of-the-art LLMs and better parameters than random. Agent-Q can be integrated into an agentic workflow, and the generated parametrized circuits with initial parameters can be used as a starting point for further optimization, e.g., as templates in quantum machine learning and as benchmarks for compilers and hardware.</description>

      <title>A Rollout-Based Algorithm and Reward Function for Resource Allocation in Business Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resource allocation plays a critical role in minimizing cycle time and improving the efficiency of business processes. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful technique to optimize resource allocation policies in business processes. In the DRL framework, an agent learns a policy through interaction with the environment, guided solely by reward signals that indicate the quality of its decisions. However, existing algorithms are not suitable for dynamic environments such as business processes. Furthermore, existing DRL-based methods rely on engineered reward functions that approximate the desired objective, but a misalignment between reward and objective can lead to undesired decisions or suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose a rollout-based DRL algorithm and a reward function to optimize the objective directly. Our algorithm iteratively improves the policy by evaluating execution trajectories following different actions. Our reward function directly decomposes the objective function of minimizing the cycle time, such that trial-and-error reward engineering becomes unnecessary. We evaluated our method in six scenarios, for which the optimal policy can be computed, and on a set of increasingly complex, realistically sized process models. The results show that our algorithm can learn the optimal policy for the scenarios and outperform or match the best heuristics on the realistically sized business processes.</description>

      <title>Progent: Programmable Privilege Control for LLM Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM agents utilize Large Language Models as central components with diverse tools to complete various user tasks, but face significant security risks when interacting with external environments. Attackers can exploit these agents through various vectors, including indirect prompt injection, memory/knowledge base poisoning, and malicious tools, tricking agents into performing dangerous actions such as unauthorized financial transactions or data leakage. The core problem that enables attacks to succeed lies in over-privileged tool access. We introduce Progent, the first privilege control framework to secure LLM agents. Progent enforces security at the tool level by restricting agents to performing tool calls necessary for user tasks while blocking potentially malicious ones. Progent features a domain-specific language that allows for expressing fine-grained policies for controlling tool privileges, flexible fallback actions when calls are blocked, and dynamic policy updates to adapt to changing agent states. The framework operates deterministically at runtime, providing provable security guarantees. Thanks to our modular design, integrating Progent does not alter agent internals and only requires minimal changes to the existing agent implementation, enhancing its practicality and potential for widespread adoption. Our extensive evaluation across various agent use cases, using benchmarks like AgentDojo, ASB, and AgentPoison, demonstrates that Progent reduces attack success rates to 0%, while preserving agent utility and speed. Additionally, we show that LLMs can automatically generate effective policies, highlighting their potential for automating the process of writing Progent's security policies.</description>

      <title>Tilus: A Tile-Level GPGPU Programming Language for Low-Precision Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for AI-powered applications, yet it demands substantial computational resources, particularly in memory bandwidth and computational throughput. Low-precision computation has emerged as a key technique to improve efficiency while reducing resource consumption. Existing approaches for generating low-precision kernels are limited to weight bit widths that are powers of two and suffer from suboptimal performance because of high-level GPU programming abstractions. These abstractions restrict critical optimizations, such as fine-grained register management and optimized memory access patterns, that are essential for efficient low-precision computations. In this paper, we introduce Tilus, a domain-specific language designed for General-Purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing that supports low-precision data types with arbitrary bit widths from 1 to 8 while maintaining GPU programmability. Tilus features a thread-block-level programming model, a hierarchical memory space, a novel algebraic layout system, and extensive support for diverse low-precision data types. Tilus programs are compiled into highly efficient GPU programs through automatic vectorization and instruction selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Tilus efficiently supports a full spectrum of low-precision data types, and outperforms state-of-the-art low-precision kernels. Compared to existing compilers such as Triton and Ladder, as well as hand-optimized kernels such as QuantLLM and Marlin, Tilus achieves performance improvements of: $1.75\times$, $2.61\times$, $1.29\times$ and $1.03\times$, respectively. We open-source Tilus at https://github.com/NVIDIA/tilus.</description>

      <title>GenTorrent: Scaling Large Language Model Serving with An Overlay Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20101v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While significant progress has been made in research and development on open-source and cost-efficient large-language models (LLMs), serving scalability remains a critical challenge, particularly for small organizations and individuals seeking to deploy and test their LLM innovations. Inspired by peer-to-peer networks that leverage decentralized overlay nodes to increase throughput and availability, we propose GenTorrent, an LLM serving overlay that harnesses computing resources from decentralized contributors. We identify four key research problems inherent to enabling such a decentralized infrastructure: 1) overlay network organization; 2) LLM communication privacy; 3) overlay forwarding for resource efficiency; and 4) verification of serving quality. This work presents the first systematic study of these fundamental problems in the context of decentralized LLM serving. Evaluation results from a prototype implemented on a set of decentralized nodes demonstrate that GenTorrent achieves a latency reduction of over 50% compared to the baseline design without overlay forwarding. Furthermore, the security features introduce minimal overhead to serving latency and throughput. We believe this work pioneers a new direction for democratizing and scaling future AI serving capabilities.</description>

      <title>Automated Parsing of Engineering Drawings for Structured Information Extraction Using a Fine-tuned Document Understanding Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering drawings is crucial for high-precision manufacturing. Manual extraction is time-consuming and error-prone, while traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques often struggle with complex layouts and overlapping symbols, resulting in unstructured outputs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning framework for structured information extraction by integrating an oriented bounding box (OBB) detection model with a transformer-based document parsing model (Donut). An in-house annotated dataset is used to train YOLOv11 for detecting nine key categories: Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&amp;T), General Tolerances, Measures, Materials, Notes, Radii, Surface Roughness, Threads, and Title Blocks. Detected OBBs are cropped into images and labeled to fine-tune Donut for structured JSON output. Fine-tuning strategies include a single model trained across all categories and category-specific models. Results show that the single model consistently outperforms category-specific ones across all evaluation metrics, achieving higher precision (94.77% for GD&amp;T), recall (100% for most), and F1 score (97.3%), while reducing hallucination (5.23%). The proposed framework improves accuracy, reduces manual effort, and supports scalable deployment in precision-driven industries.</description>

      <title>FairPO: Robust Preference Optimization for Fair Multi-Label Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose FairPO, a novel framework designed to promote fairness in multi-label classification by directly optimizing preference signals with a group robustness perspective. In our framework, the set of labels is partitioned into privileged and non-privileged groups, and a preference-based loss inspired by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is employed to more effectively differentiate true positive labels from confusing negatives within the privileged group, while preserving baseline classification performance for non-privileged labels. By framing the learning problem as a robust optimization over groups, our approach dynamically adjusts the training emphasis toward groups with poorer performance, thereby mitigating bias and ensuring a fairer treatment across diverse label categories. In addition, we outline plans to extend this approach by investigating alternative loss formulations such as Simple Preference Optimisation (SimPO) and Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO) to exploit reference-free reward formulations and contrastive training signals. Furthermore, we plan to extend FairPO with multilabel generation capabilities, enabling the model to dynamically generate diverse and coherent label sets for ambiguous inputs.</description>

      <title>ORBIT-2: Scaling Exascale Vision Foundation Models for Weather and Climate Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse observations and coarse-resolution climate models limit effective regional decision-making, underscoring the need for robust downscaling. However, existing AI methods struggle with generalization across variables and geographies and are constrained by the quadratic complexity of Vision Transformer (ViT) self-attention. We introduce ORBIT-2, a scalable foundation model for global, hyper-resolution climate downscaling. ORBIT-2 incorporates two key innovations: (1) Residual Slim ViT (Reslim), a lightweight architecture with residual learning and Bayesian regularization for efficient, robust prediction; and (2) TILES, a tile-wise sequence scaling algorithm that reduces self-attention complexity from quadratic to linear, enabling long-sequence processing and massive parallelism. ORBIT-2 scales to 10 billion parameters across 65,536 GPUs, achieving up to 4.1 exaFLOPS sustained throughput and 74--98% strong scaling efficiency. It supports downscaling to 0.9 km global resolution and processes sequences up to 4.2 billion tokens. On 7 km resolution benchmarks, ORBIT-2 achieves high accuracy with $R^2$ scores in the range of 0.98--0.99 against observational data.</description>

      <title>Mask-PINNs: Mitigating Internal Covariate Shift in Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws directly into the loss function. However, as a fundamental optimization issue, internal covariate shift (ICS) hinders the stable and effective training of PINNs by disrupting feature distributions and limiting model expressiveness. Unlike standard deep learning tasks, conventional remedies for ICS -- such as Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization -- are not directly applicable to PINNs, as they distort the physical consistency required for reliable PDE solutions. To address this issue, we propose Mask-PINNs, a novel architecture that introduces a learnable mask function to regulate feature distributions while preserving the underlying physical constraints of PINNs. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that the mask suppresses the expansion of feature representations through a carefully designed modulation mechanism. Empirically, we validate the method on multiple PDE benchmarks -- including convection, wave propagation, and Helmholtz equations -- across diverse activation functions. Our results show consistent improvements in prediction accuracy, convergence stability, and robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Mask-PINNs enable the effective use of wider networks, overcoming a key limitation in existing PINN frameworks.</description>

      <title>ManipBench: Benchmarking Vision-Language Models for Low-Level Robot Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence and robotics due to their commonsense reasoning capabilities. In robotic manipulation, VLMs are used primarily as high-level planners, but recent work has also studied their lower-level reasoning ability, which refers to making decisions about precise robot movements. However, the community currently lacks a clear and common benchmark that can evaluate how well VLMs can aid low-level reasoning in robotics. Consequently, we propose a novel benchmark, ManipBench, to evaluate the low-level robot manipulation reasoning capabilities of VLMs across various dimensions, including how well they understand object-object interactions and deformable object manipulation. We extensively test 33 representative VLMs across 10 model families on our benchmark, including variants to test different model sizes. Our evaluation shows that the performance of VLMs significantly varies across tasks, and there is a strong correlation between this performance and trends in our real-world manipulation tasks. It also shows that there remains a significant gap between these models and human-level understanding. See our website at: https://manipbench.github.io.</description>

      <title>Search and Refine During Think: Autonomous Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11277v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities but are inherently limited by their knowledge reservoir. Retrieval-augmented reasoning mitigates this limitation by allowing LLMs to query external resources, but existing methods often retrieve irrelevant or noisy information, hindering accurate reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoRefine, a reinforcement learning post-training framework that adopts a new ``search-and-refine-during-think'' paradigm. AutoRefine introduces explicit knowledge refinement steps between successive search calls, enabling the model to iteratively filter, distill, and organize evidence before generating an answer. Furthermore, we incorporate tailored retrieval-specific rewards alongside answer correctness rewards using group relative policy optimization. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that AutoRefine significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in complex, multi-hop reasoning scenarios. Detailed analysis shows that AutoRefine issues frequent, higher-quality searches and synthesizes evidence effectively.</description>

      <title>One Shot Dominance: Knowledge Poisoning Attack on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have shown improved performance in generating accurate responses. However, the dependence on external knowledge bases introduces potential security vulnerabilities, particularly when these knowledge bases are publicly accessible and modifiable. While previous studies have exposed knowledge poisoning risks in RAG systems, existing attack methods suffer from critical limitations: they either require injecting multiple poisoned documents (resulting in poor stealthiness) or can only function effectively on simplistic queries (limiting real-world applicability). This paper reveals a more realistic knowledge poisoning attack against RAG systems that achieves successful attacks by poisoning only a single document while remaining effective for complex multi-hop questions involving complex relationships between multiple elements. Our proposed AuthChain address three challenges to ensure the poisoned documents are reliably retrieved and trusted by the LLM, even against large knowledge bases and LLM's own knowledge.

      <title>ViEEG: Hierarchical Visual Neural Representation for EEG Brain Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12408v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and decoding brain activity into visual representations is a fundamental challenge at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. While EEG visual decoding has shown promise due to its non-invasive, and low-cost nature, existing methods suffer from Hierarchical Neural Encoding Neglect (HNEN)-a critical limitation where flat neural representations fail to model the brain's hierarchical visual processing hierarchy. Inspired by the hierarchical organization of visual cortex, we propose ViEEG, a neuro-We further adopt hierarchical contrastive learning for EEG-CLIP representation alignment, enabling zero-shot object recognition. Extensive experiments on the THINGS-EEG dataset demonstrate that ViEEG significantly outperforms previous methods by a large margin in both subject-dependent and subject-independent settings. Results on the THINGS-MEG dataset further confirm ViEEG's generalization to different neural modalities. Our framework not only advances the performance frontier but also sets a new paradigm for EEG brain decoding. inspired framework that addresses HNEN. ViEEG decomposes each visual stimulus into three biologically aligned components-contour, foreground object, and contextual scene-serving as anchors for a three-stream EEG encoder. These EEG features are progressively integrated via cross-attention routing, simulating cortical information flow from low-level to high-level vision.</description>

      <title>FreqSelect: Frequency-Aware fMRI-to-Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing natural images from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data remains a core challenge in natural decoding due to the mismatch between the richness of visual stimuli and the noisy, low resolution nature of fMRI signals. While recent two-stage models, combining deep variational autoencoders (VAEs) with diffusion models, have advanced this task, they treat all spatial-frequency components of the input equally. This uniform treatment forces the model to extract meaning features and suppress irrelevant noise simultaneously, limiting its effectiveness. We introduce FreqSelect, a lightweight, adaptive module that selectively filters spatial-frequency bands before encoding. By dynamically emphasizing frequencies that are most predictive of brain activity and suppressing those that are uninformative, FreqSelect acts as a content-aware gate between image features and natural data. It integrates seamlessly into standard very deep VAE-diffusion pipelines and requires no additional supervision. Evaluated on the Natural Scenes dataset, FreqSelect consistently improves reconstruction quality across both low- and high-level metrics. Beyond performance gains, the learned frequency-selection patterns offer interpretable insights into how different visual frequencies are represented in the brain. Our method generalizes across subjects and scenes, and holds promise for extension to other neuroimaging modalities, offering a principled approach to enhancing both decoding accuracy and neuroscientific interpretability.</description>

      <title>Toward Real-World Cooperative and Competitive Soccer with Quadrupedal Robot Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving coordinated teamwork among legged robots requires both fine-grained locomotion control and long-horizon strategic decision-making. Robot soccer offers a compelling testbed for this challenge, combining dynamic, competitive, and multi-agent interactions. In this work, we present a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables fully autonomous and decentralized quadruped robot soccer. First, a set of highly dynamic low-level skills is trained for legged locomotion and ball manipulation, such as walking, dribbling, and kicking. On top of these, a high-level strategic planning policy is trained with Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) via Fictitious Self-Play (FSP). This learning framework allows agents to adapt to diverse opponent strategies and gives rise to sophisticated team behaviors, including coordinated passing, interception, and dynamic role allocation. With an extensive ablation study, the proposed learning method shows significant advantages in the cooperative and competitive multi-agent soccer game. We deploy the learned policies to real quadruped robots relying solely on onboard proprioception and decentralized localization, with the resulting system supporting autonomous robot-robot and robot-human soccer matches on indoor and outdoor soccer courts.</description>

      <title>Unveil Multi-Picture Descriptions for Multilingual Mild Cognitive Impairment Detection via Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17067v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment from picture descriptions is critical yet challenging, especially in multilingual and multiple picture settings. Prior work has primarily focused on English speakers describing a single picture (e.g., the 'Cookie Theft'). The TAUKDIAL-2024 challenge expands this scope by introducing multilingual speakers and multiple pictures, which presents new challenges in analyzing picture-dependent content. To address these challenges, we propose a framework with three components: (1) enhancing discriminative representation learning via supervised contrastive learning, (2) involving image modality rather than relying solely on speech and text modalities, and (3) applying a Product of Experts (PoE) strategy to mitigate spurious correlations and overfitting. Our framework improves MCI detection performance, achieving a +7.1% increase in Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) (from 68.1% to 75.2%) and a +2.9% increase in F1 score (from 80.6% to 83.5%) compared to the text unimodal baseline. Notably, the contrastive learning component yields greater gains for the text modality compared to speech. These results highlight our framework's effectiveness in multilingual and multi-picture MCI detection.</description>

      <title>From Tokens to Thoughts: How LLMs and Humans Trade Compression for Meaning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17117v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans organize knowledge into compact categories through semantic compression by mapping diverse instances to abstract representations while preserving meaning (e.g., robin and blue jay are both birds; most birds can fly). These concepts reflect a trade-off between expressive fidelity and representational simplicity. Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable linguistic abilities, yet whether their internal representations strike a human-like trade-off between compression and semantic fidelity is unclear. We introduce a novel information-theoretic framework, drawing from Rate-Distortion Theory and the Information Bottleneck principle, to quantitatively compare these strategies. Analyzing token embeddings from a diverse suite of LLMs against seminal human categorization benchmarks, we uncover key divergences. While LLMs form broad conceptual categories that align with human judgment, they struggle to capture the fine-grained semantic distinctions crucial for human understanding. More fundamentally, LLMs demonstrate a strong bias towards aggressive statistical compression, whereas human conceptual systems appear to prioritize adaptive nuance and contextual richness, even if this results in lower compressional efficiency by our measures. These findings illuminate critical differences between current AI and human cognitive architectures, guiding pathways toward LLMs with more human-aligned conceptual representations.</description>

      <title>Cog-TiPRO: Iterative Prompt Refinement with LLMs to Detect Cognitive Decline via Longitudinal Voice Assistant Commands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early detection of cognitive decline is crucial for enabling interventions that can slow neurodegenerative disease progression. Traditional diagnostic approaches rely on labor-intensive clinical assessments, which are impractical for frequent monitoring. Our pilot study investigates voice assistant systems (VAS) as non-invasive tools for detecting cognitive decline through longitudinal analysis of speech patterns in voice commands. Over an 18-month period, we collected voice commands from 35 older adults, with 15 participants providing daily at-home VAS interactions. To address the challenges of analyzing these short, unstructured and noisy commands, we propose Cog-TiPRO, a framework that combines (1) LLM-driven iterative prompt refinement for linguistic feature extraction, (2) HuBERT-based acoustic feature extraction, and (3) transformer-based temporal modeling. Using iTransformer, our approach achieves 73.80% accuracy and 72.67% F1-score in detecting MCI, outperforming its baseline by 27.13%. Through our LLM approach, we identify linguistic features that uniquely characterize everyday command usage patterns in individuals experiencing cognitive decline.</description>

      <title>How Can I Publish My LLM Benchmark Without Giving the True Answers Away?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18102v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Publishing a large language model (LLM) benchmark on the Internet risks contaminating future LLMs: the benchmark may be unintentionally (or intentionally) used to train or select a model. A common mitigation is to keep the benchmark private and let participants submit their models or predictions to the organizers. However, this strategy will require trust in a single organization and still permits test-set overfitting through repeated queries. To overcome this issue, we propose a way to publish benchmarks without completely disclosing the ground-truth answers to the questions, while still maintaining the ability to openly evaluate LLMs. Our main idea is to inject randomness to the answers by preparing several logically correct answers, and only include one of them as the solution in the benchmark. This reduces the best possible accuracy, i.e., Bayes accuracy, of the benchmark. Not only is this helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this approach also offers a test for detecting data contamination. In principle, even fully capable models should not surpass the Bayes accuracy. If a model surpasses this ceiling despite this expectation, this is a strong signal of data contamination. We present experimental evidence that our method can detect data contamination accurately on a wide range of benchmarks, models, and training methodologies.</description>

      <title>The challenge of hidden gifts in multi-agent reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20579v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sometimes we benefit from actions that others have taken even when we are unaware that they took those actions. For example, if your neighbor chooses not to take a parking spot in front of your house when you are not there, you can benefit, even without being aware that they took this action. These "hidden gifts" represent an interesting challenge for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), since assigning credit when the beneficial actions of others are hidden is non-trivial. Here, we study the impact of hidden gifts with a very simple MARL task. In this task, agents in a grid-world environment have individual doors to unlock in order to obtain individual rewards. As well, if all the agents unlock their door the group receives a larger collective reward. However, there is only one key for all of the doors, such that the collective reward can only be obtained when the agents drop the key for others after they use it. Notably, there is nothing to indicate to an agent that the other agents have dropped the key, thus the act of dropping the key for others is a "hidden gift". We show that several different state-of-the-art RL algorithms, including MARL algorithms, fail to learn how to obtain the collective reward in this simple task. Interestingly, we find that independent model-free policy gradient agents can solve the task when we provide them with information about their own action history, but MARL agents still cannot solve the task with action history. Finally, we derive a correction term for these independent agents, inspired by learning aware approaches, which reduces the variance in learning and helps them to converge to collective success more reliably. These results show that credit assignment in multi-agent settings can be particularly challenging in the presence of "hidden gifts", and demonstrate that learning awareness in independent agents can benefit these settings.</description>

      <title>DiffDecompose: Layer-Wise Decomposition of Alpha-Composited Images via Diffusion Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently motivated great success in many generation tasks like object removal. Nevertheless, existing image decomposition methods struggle to disentangle semi-transparent or transparent layer occlusions due to mask prior dependencies, static object assumptions, and the lack of datasets. In this paper, we delve into a novel task: Layer-Wise Decomposition of Alpha-Composited Images, aiming to recover constituent layers from single overlapped images under the condition of semi-transparent/transparent alpha layer non-linear occlusion. To address challenges in layer ambiguity, generalization, and data scarcity, we first introduce AlphaBlend, the first large-scale and high-quality dataset for transparent and semi-transparent layer decomposition, supporting six real-world subtasks (e.g., translucent flare removal, semi-transparent cell decomposition, glassware decomposition). Building on this dataset, we present DiffDecompose, a diffusion Transformer-based framework that learns the posterior over possible layer decompositions conditioned on the input image, semantic prompts, and blending type. Rather than regressing alpha mattes directly, DiffDecompose performs In-Context Decomposition, enabling the model to predict one or multiple layers without per-layer supervision, and introduces Layer Position Encoding Cloning to maintain pixel-level correspondence across layers. Extensive experiments on the proposed AlphaBlend dataset and public LOGO dataset verify the effectiveness of DiffDecompose. The code and dataset will be available upon paper acceptance. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/Wangzt1121/DiffDecompose.</description>

      <title>Can NeRFs See without Cameras?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have been remarkably successful at synthesizing novel views of 3D scenes by optimizing a volumetric scene function. This scene function models how optical rays bring color information from a 3D object to the camera pixels. Radio frequency (RF) or audio signals can also be viewed as a vehicle for delivering information about the environment to a sensor. However, unlike camera pixels, an RF/audio sensor receives a mixture of signals that contain many environmental reflections (also called "multipath"). Is it still possible to infer the environment using such multipath signals? We show that with redesign, NeRFs can be taught to learn from multipath signals, and thereby "see" the environment. As a grounding application, we aim to infer the indoor floorplan of a home from sparse WiFi measurements made at multiple locations inside the home. Although a difficult inverse problem, our implicitly learnt floorplans look promising, and enables forward applications, such as indoor signal prediction and basic ray tracing.</description>

Abstract: This study illustrates how incorporating feedback-oriented annotations into the scoring pipeline can enhance the accuracy of automated essay scoring (AES). This approach is demonstrated with the Persuasive Essays for Rating, Selecting, and Understanding Argumentative and Discourse Elements (PERSUADE) corpus. We integrate two types of feedback-driven annotations: those that identify spelling and grammatical errors, and those that highlight argumentative components. To illustrate how this method could be applied in real-world scenarios, we employ two LLMs to generate annotations -- a generative language model used for spell correction and an encoder-based token-classifier trained to identify and mark argumentative elements. By incorporating annotations into the scoring process, we demonstrate improvements in performance using encoder-based large language models fine-tuned as classifiers.</description>

      <title>Multiple LLM Agents Debate for Equitable Cultural Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) need to adapt their predictions to diverse cultural contexts to benefit diverse communities across the world. While previous efforts have focused on single-LLM, single-turn approaches, we propose to exploit the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs to promote cultural adaptability. We introduce a Multi-Agent Debate framework, where two LLM-based agents debate over a cultural scenario and collaboratively reach a final decision. We propose two variants: one where either LLM agents exclusively debate and another where they dynamically choose between self-reflection and debate during their turns. We evaluate these approaches on 7 open-weight LLMs (and 21 LLM combinations) using the NormAd-ETI benchmark for social etiquette norms in 75 countries. Experiments show that debate improves both overall accuracy and cultural group parity over single-LLM baselines. Notably, multi-agent debate enables relatively small LLMs (7-9B) to achieve accuracies comparable to that of a much larger model (27B parameters).</description>

      <title>Should I Share this Translation? Evaluating Quality Feedback for User Reliance on Machine Translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As people increasingly use AI systems in work and daily life, feedback mechanisms that help them use AI responsibly are urgently needed, particularly in settings where users are not equipped to assess the quality of AI predictions. We study a realistic Machine Translation (MT) scenario where monolingual users decide whether to share an MT output, first without and then with quality feedback. We compare four types of quality feedback: explicit feedback that directly give users an assessment of translation quality using (1) error highlights and (2) LLM explanations, and implicit feedback that helps users compare MT inputs and outputs through (3) backtranslation and (4) question-answer (QA) tables. We find that all feedback types, except error highlights, significantly improve both decision accuracy and appropriate reliance. Notably, implicit feedback, especially QA tables, yields significantly greater gains than explicit feedback in terms of decision accuracy, appropriate reliance, and user perceptions, receiving the highest ratings for helpfulness and trust, and the lowest for mental burden.</description>

      <title>A versatile foundation model for cine cardiac magnetic resonance image analysis tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we present a versatile foundation model that can perform a range of clinically-relevant image analysis tasks, including segmentation, landmark localisation, diagnosis, and prognostication. A multi-view convolution-transformer masked autoencoder, named as CineMA, was trained on 15 million cine images from 74,916 subjects. The model was validated on multiple image analysis tasks and compared to existing models on &gt;4,500 images from eight independent datasets with diverse population characteristics, representing the largest benchmark study for cine CMR so far. CineMA consistently outperformed conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in delineating ventricular boundaries and estimating ejection fraction, a key measure of cardiac function. The improved performance was preserved, even when the model only used half of fine-tuning data. CineMA also surpassed CNNs in disease detection and matched their performance in long-axis function measurement. Interestingly, we found that CineMA can also detect cardiac changes in systemic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and cancer, and can also predict mortality.

      <title>Speeding Up Hyper-Heuristics With Markov-Chain Operator Selection and the Only-Worsening Acceptance Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The move-acceptance hyper-heuristic was recently shown to be able to leave local optima with astonishing efficiency (Lissovoi et al., Artificial Intelligence (2023)). In this work, we propose two modifications to this algorithm that demonstrate impressive performances on a large class of benchmarks including the classic Cliff$_d$ and Jump$_m$ function classes. (i) Instead of randomly choosing between the only-improving and any-move acceptance operator, we take this choice via a simple two-state Markov chain. This modification alone reduces the runtime on Jump$_m$ functions with gap parameter $m$ from $\Omega(n^{2m-1})$ to $O(n^{m+1})$. (ii) We then replace the all-moves acceptance operator with the operator that only accepts worsenings. Such a, counter-intuitive, operator has not been used before in the literature. However, our proofs show that our only-worsening operator can greatly help in leaving local optima, reducing, e.g., the runtime on Jump functions to $O(n^3 \log n)$ independent of the gap size. In general, we prove a remarkably good runtime of $O(n^{k+1} \log n)$ for our Markov move-acceptance hyper-heuristic on all members of a new benchmark class SEQOPT$_k$, which contains a large number of functions having $k$ successive local optima, and which contains the commonly studied Jump$_m$ and Cliff$_d$ functions for $k=2$.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Reliability in Text-Guided Medical Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01921v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-guided image editing has seen rapid progress in natural image domains, but its adaptation to medical imaging remains limited and lacks standardized evaluation. Clinically, such editing holds promise for simulating surgical outcomes, creating personalized teaching materials, and enhancing patient communication. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating text-guided medical image editing. It consists of 1,182 clinically sourced image-prompt triplets spanning 70 tasks across 13 anatomical regions. MedEBench offers three key contributions: (1) a clinically relevant evaluation framework covering Editing Accuracy, Contextual Preservation, and Visual Quality, supported by detailed descriptions of expected change and ROI (Region of Interest) masks; (2) a systematic comparison of seven state-of-the-art models, revealing common failure patterns; and (3) a failure analysis protocol based on attention grounding, using IoU between attention maps and ROIs to identify mislocalization. MedEBench provides a solid foundation for developing and evaluating reliable, clinically meaningful medical image editing systems.

      <title>FinS-Pilot: A Benchmark for Online Financial RAG System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various professional domains, with their performance typically evaluated through standardized benchmarks. In the financial field, the stringent demands for professional accuracy and real-time data processing often necessitate the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. However, the development of financial RAG benchmarks has been constrained by data confidentiality issues and the lack of dynamic data integration. To address this issue, we introduce FinS-Pilot, a novel benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in online financial applications. Constructed from real-world financial assistant interactions, our benchmark incorporates both real-time API data and text data, organized through an intent classification framework covering critical financial domains. The benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation of financial assistants' capabilities in handling both static knowledge and time-sensitive market information.Through systematic experiments with multiple Chinese leading LLMs, we demonstrate FinS-Pilot's effectiveness in identifying models suitable for financial applications while addressing the current gap in specialized evaluation tools for the financial domain. Our work contributes both a practical evaluation framework and a curated dataset to advance research in financial NLP systems. The code and dataset are accessible on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Labelling Data with Unknown References</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An evaluator is trustworthy when there exists some agreed-upon way to measure its performance as a labeller. The two ways to establish trustworthiness are either by testing it, or by assuming the evaluator `knows' somehow the way to label the corpus. However, if labelled references (e.g., a development set) are unavailable, neither of these approaches work: the former requires the data, and the latter is an assumption, not evidence. To address this, we introduce an algorithm (the `No-Data Algorithm') by which to establish trust in an evaluator without any existing references. Our algorithm works by successively posing challenges to said evaluator. We show that this is sufficient to establish trustworthiness w.h.p., in such a way that when the evaluator actually knows the way to label the corpus, the No-Data Algorithm accepts its output; and, conversely, flags untrustworthy evaluators when these are unable to prove it. We present formal proofs of correctness, empirical tests, and applications to LLMs-as-judges on low-resource languages.</description>

      <title>Auto prompt sql: a resource-efficient architecture for text-to-sql translation in constrained environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the best Text-to-SQL methods in resource-constrained environments is challenging due to their reliance on resource-intensive open-source models. This paper introduces Auto Prompt SQL(AP-SQL), a novel architecture designed to bridge the gap between resource-efficient small open-source models and the powerful capabilities of large closed-source models for Text-to-SQL translation. Our method decomposes the task into schema filtering, retrieval-augmented text-to-SQL generation based on in-context examples, and prompt-driven schema linking and SQL generation. To improve schema selection accuracy, we fine-tune large language models. Crucially, we also explore the impact of prompt engineering throughout the process, leveraging Chain-of-Thought(CoT) and Graph-of-Thought(GoT) templates to significantly enhance the model's reasoning for accurate SQL generation. Comprehensive evaluations on the Spider benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AP-SQL.</description>

      <title>LLMEval-Med: A Real-world Clinical Benchmark for Medical LLMs with Physician Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04078v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in medicine is crucial because medical applications require high accuracy with little room for error. Current medical benchmarks have three main types: medical exam-based, comprehensive medical, and specialized assessments. However, these benchmarks have limitations in question design (mostly multiple-choice), data sources (often not derived from real clinical scenarios), and evaluation methods (poor assessment of complex reasoning). To address these issues, we present LLMEval-Med, a new benchmark covering five core medical areas, including 2,996 questions created from real-world electronic health records and expert-designed clinical scenarios. We also design an automated evaluation pipeline, incorporating expert-developed checklists into our LLM-as-Judge framework. Furthermore, our methodology validates machine scoring through human-machine agreement analysis, dynamically refining checklists and prompts based on expert feedback to ensure reliability. We evaluate 13 LLMs across three categories (specialized medical models, open-source models, and closed-source models) on LLMEval-Med, providing valuable insights for the safe and effective deployment of LLMs in medical domains. The dataset is released in https://github.com/llmeval/LLMEval-Med.</description>

      <title>A theoretical framework for self-supervised contrastive learning for continuous dependent data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach to learning representations, particularly in the field of computer vision. However, its application to dependent data, such as temporal and spatio-temporal domains, remains underexplored. Besides, traditional contrastive SSL methods often assume \emph{semantic independence between samples}, which does not hold for dependent data exhibiting complex correlations. We propose a novel theoretical framework for contrastive SSL tailored to \emph{continuous dependent data}, which allows the nearest samples to be semantically close to each other. In particular, we propose two possible \textit{ground truth similarity measures} between objects -- \emph{hard} and \emph{soft} closeness. Under it, we derive an analytical form for the \textit{estimated similarity matrix} that accommodates both types of closeness between samples, thereby introducing dependency-aware loss functions. We validate our approach, \emph{Dependent TS2Vec}, on temporal and spatio-temporal downstream problems. Given the dependency patterns presented in the data, our approach surpasses modern ones for dependent data, highlighting the effectiveness of our theoretically grounded loss functions for SSL in capturing spatio-temporal dependencies. Specifically, we outperform TS2Vec on the standard UEA and UCR benchmarks, with accuracy improvements of $4.17$\% and $2.08$\%, respectively. Furthermore, on the drought classification task, which involves complex spatio-temporal patterns, our method achieves a $7$\% higher ROC-AUC score.</description>

      <title>QGuard:Question-based Zero-shot Guard for Multi-modal LLM Safety</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have had a significant impact on a wide range of fields, from general domains to specialized areas. However, these advancements have also significantly increased the potential for malicious users to exploit harmful and jailbreak prompts for malicious attacks. Although there have been many efforts to prevent harmful prompts and jailbreak prompts, protecting LLMs from such malicious attacks remains an important and challenging task. In this paper, we propose QGuard, a simple yet effective safety guard method, that utilizes question prompting to block harmful prompts in a zero-shot manner. Our method can defend LLMs not only from text-based harmful prompts but also from multi-modal harmful prompt attacks. Moreover, by diversifying and modifying guard questions, our approach remains robust against the latest harmful prompts without fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our model performs competitively on both text-only and multi-modal harmful datasets. Additionally, by providing an analysis of question prompting, we enable a white-box analysis of user inputs. We believe our method provides valuable insights for real-world LLM services in mitigating security risks associated with harmful prompts.</description>

      <title>What Is the Point of Equality in Machine Learning Fairness? Beyond Equality of Opportunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has become a rapidly growing area of research. But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML wrong? And why should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly appeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable benefits and goods, such as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally distributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because they unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive focus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading ethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism--the view that equality is a fundamental moral and social ideal--requires challenging structural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that privilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality manifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g., economic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While distributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why representational harms are wrong--why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce social hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups--and why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals (i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a multifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both distributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political philosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for tackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems. The paper also outlines practical pathways for implementing the framework across the entire ML pipeline.</description>

      <title>TPTT: Transforming Pretrained Transformers into Titans</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance across many natural language processing tasks. Nonetheless, their quadratic computational and memory requirements, particularly in self-attention layers, pose challenges for efficient inference on long contexts and for deployment in resource-limited environments. We present TPTT (Transforming Pretrained Transformers into Titans), a framework designed to augment pretrained Transformers with linearized attention (LiZA) and internal memory gating via Memory as Gate (MaG), applied without full retraining. TPTT supports parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) and integrates with standard toolkits such as Hugging Face Transformers. We evaluated TPTT on several pretrained models, including Llama-1B, OlMoE-1B-7B, Qwen2.5-1.5B, Gemma3-270m, OpenELM-1.3B, and Mistral-7B, in order to assess applicability across architectures of different scales.Experiments on models with approximately 1 billion parameters, evaluated primarily on the MMLU benchmark, suggest potential improvements in both efficiency and accuracy compared to baseline models. For example, Titans-Llama-1B exhibited up to a 20\% relative increase in Exact Match scores in one-shot evaluation. An additional finding is that it is possible to convert a quadratic-attention model into a purely linear-attention model using the DeltaProduct mechanism. All training runs were carried out with modest computational resources.These preliminary findings indicate that TPTT may help adapt pretrained LLMs for long-context tasks with limited overhead. Further studies on larger models and a broader set of benchmarks will be necessary to evaluate the generality and robustness of the framework.

      <title>Flow-Modulated Scoring for Semantic-Aware Knowledge Graph Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graph completion demands effective modeling of multifaceted semantic relationships between entities. Yet, prevailing methods, which rely on static scoring functions over learned embeddings, struggling to simultaneously capture rich semantic context and the dynamic nature of relations. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) framework, conceptualizing a relation as a dynamic evolutionary process governed by its static semantic environment. FMS operates in two stages: it first learns context-aware entity embeddings via a Semantic Context Learning module, and then models a dynamic flow between them using a Conditional Flow-Matching module. This learned flow dynamically modulates a base static score for the entity pair. By unifying context-rich static representations with a conditioned dynamic flow, FMS achieves a more comprehensive understanding of relational semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FMS establishes a new state of the art across both canonical knowledge graph completion tasks: relation prediction and entity prediction. On the standard relation prediction benchmark FB15k-237, FMS achieves a near-perfect MRR of 99.8\% and Hits@1 of 99.7\% using a mere 0.35M parameters, while also attaining a 99.9\% MRR on WN18RR. Its dominance extends to entity prediction, where it secures a 25.2\% relative MRR gain in the transductive setting and substantially outperforms all baselines in challenging inductive settings. By unifying a dynamic flow mechanism with rich static contexts, FMS offers a highly effective and parameter-efficient new paradigm for knowledge graph completion.

      <title>Towards Efficient and Accurate Spiking Neural Networks via Adaptive Bit Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-bit spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently become a heated research spot, pursuing energy-efficient and high-accurate AI. However, with more bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to the point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on the insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra bits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit allocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise allocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and accuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and the bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable through gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths and temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle different temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal lengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically formulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may incur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size renewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets, including the static CIFAR and ImageNet datasets and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS, DVS-GESTURE, and SHD datasets, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and computation cost while achieving higher accuracy. Particularly, our SEWResNet-34 can achieve a 2.69% accuracy gain and 4.16x lower bit budgets over the advanced baseline work on ImageNet. This work will be open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Iterative Distillation for Reward-Guided Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Models in Biomolecular Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of fine-tuning diffusion models for reward-guided generation in biomolecular design. While diffusion models have proven highly effective in modeling complex, high-dimensional data distributions, real-world applications often demand more than high-fidelity generation, requiring optimization with respect to potentially non-differentiable reward functions such as physics-based simulation or rewards based on scientific knowledge. Although RL methods have been explored to fine-tune diffusion models for such objectives, they often suffer from instability, low sample efficiency, and mode collapse due to their on-policy nature. In this work, we propose an iterative distillation-based fine-tuning framework that enables diffusion models to optimize for arbitrary reward functions. Our method casts the problem as policy distillation: it collects off-policy data during the roll-in phase, simulates reward-based soft-optimal policies during roll-out, and updates the model by minimizing the KL divergence between the simulated soft-optimal policy and the current model policy. Our off-policy formulation, combined with KL divergence minimization, enhances training stability and sample efficiency compared to existing RL-based methods. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and superior reward optimization of our approach across diverse tasks in protein, small molecule, and regulatory DNA design.</description>

      <title>RALLY: Role-Adaptive LLM-Driven Yoked Navigation for Agentic UAV Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) swarms has emerged as a critical research focus, and it typically requires the swarm to navigate effectively while avoiding obstacles and achieving continuous coverage over multiple mission targets. Although traditional Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approaches offer dynamic adaptability, they are hindered by the semantic gap in numerical communication and the rigidity of homogeneous role structures, resulting in poor generalization and limited task scalability. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based control frameworks demonstrate strong semantic reasoning capabilities by leveraging extensive prior knowledge. However, due to the lack of online learning and over-reliance on static priors, these works often struggle with effective exploration, leading to reduced individual potential and overall system performance. To address these limitations, we propose a Role-Adaptive LLM-Driven Yoked navigation algorithm RALLY. Specifically, we first develop an LLM-driven semantic decision framework that uses structured natural language for efficient semantic communication and collaborative reasoning. Afterward, we introduce a dynamic role-heterogeneity mechanism for adaptive role switching and personalized decision-making. Furthermore, we propose a Role-value Mixing Network (RMIX)-based assignment strategy that integrates LLM offline priors with MARL online policies to enable semi-offline training of role selection strategies. Experiments in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE) environment and a Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) platform demonstrate that RALLY outperforms conventional approaches in terms of task coverage, convergence speed, and generalization, highlighting its strong potential for collaborative navigation in agentic multi-UAV systems.</description>

      <title>NOCTIS: Novel Object Cyclic Threshold based Instance Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instance segmentation of novel objects instances in RGB images, given some example images for each object, is a well known problem in computer vision. Designing a model general enough to be employed for all kinds of novel objects without (re-) training has proven to be a difficult task. To handle this, we present a new training-free framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic Threshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). NOCTIS integrates two pre-trained models: Grounded-SAM 2 for object proposals with precise bounding boxes and corresponding segmentation masks; and DINOv2 for robust class and patch embeddings, due to its zero-shot capabilities. Internally, the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an object matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the average maximum similarity of the patch embeddings with a new cyclic thresholding (CT) mechanism that mitigates unstable matches caused by repetitive textures or visually similar patterns. Beyond CT, NOCTIS introduces: (i) an appearance score that is unaffected by object selection bias; (ii) the usage of the average confidence of the proposals bounding box and mask as a scoring component; and (iii) an RGB-only pipeline that performs even better than RGB-D ones. We empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning, attains state-of-the-art results regarding the mean AP score, w.r.t. the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the BOP 2023 challenge for the "Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects" task.</description>

      <title>MedVAL: Toward Expert-Level Medical Text Validation with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03152v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing use of language models (LMs) in clinical environments, there is an immediate need to evaluate the accuracy and safety of LM-generated medical text. Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician review. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because 1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often unavailable in real-world settings. While the "LM-as-judge" paradigm (a LM evaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss subtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we propose MedVAL, a self-supervised framework that leverages synthetic data to train evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are factually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or reference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a dataset containing 840 outputs annotated by physicians, following a physician-defined taxonomy of risk levels and error categories. Across 6 diverse medical tasks and 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source, proprietary, and medically adapted models, MedVAL fine-tuning significantly improves (p &lt; 0.001) alignment with physicians on both seen and unseen tasks, increasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%, with per-sample safety classification scores up to 86%. MedVAL improves the performance of even the best-performing proprietary LM (GPT-4o) by 8%. To support a scalable, risk-aware pathway towards clinical integration, we open-source the 1) codebase (https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/MedVAL), 2) MedVAL-Bench (https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-Bench), and 3) MedVAL-4B (https://huggingface.co/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-4B), the best-performing open-source LM. Our research provides the first evidence of LMs approaching expert-level validation ability for medical text.</description>

      <title>Driving as a Diagnostic Tool: Scenario-based Cognitive Assessment in Older Drivers from Driving Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce scenario-based cognitive status identification in older drivers from naturalistic driving videos, leveraging large vision models. In recent times, cognitive decline including Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), is often underdiagnosed due to the time-consuming and costly nature of current diagnostic methods. By analyzing real-world driving behavior captured through in-vehicle sensors, this study aims to extract "digital fingerprints" that correlate with functional decline and clinical features of dementia. Moreover, modern large vision models can draw meaningful insights from everyday driving patterns across different roadway scenarios to early detect cognitive decline. We propose a framework that uses large vision models and naturalistic driving videos to analyze driver behavior, identify cognitive status and predict disease progression. We leverage the strong relationship between real-world driving behavior as an observation of the current cognitive status of the drivers where the vehicle can be utilized as a "diagnostic tool". Our method identifies early warning signs of functional impairment, contributing to proactive intervention strategies. This work enhances early detection and supports the development of scalable, non-invasive monitoring systems to mitigate the growing societal and economic burden of cognitive decline in the aging population.</description>

      <title>Agentic-R1: Distilled Dual-Strategy Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current long chain-of-thought (long-CoT) models excel at mathematical reasoning but rely on slow and error-prone natural language traces. Tool-augmented agents address arithmetic via code execution, but often falter on complex logical tasks. We introduce a fine-tuning framework, DualDistill, that distills complementary reasoning strategies from multiple teachers into a unified student model. Using this approach, we train Agentic-R1, which dynamically selects the optimal strategy for each query, invoking tools for arithmetic and algorithmic problems, and using text-based reasoning for abstract ones. Our method improves accuracy across a range of tasks, including both computation-intensive and standard benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-strategy distillation in achieving robust and efficient reasoning.

      <title>Demographic-aware fine-grained classification of pediatric wrist fractures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12964v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who constitute the majority of fracture cases. Computer vision presents a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse and plentiful data types. This study addresses the problem using a multifaceted approach: framing it as a fine-grained recognition task, fusing patient metadata with X-rays, and leveraging weights from a separate fine-grained dataset rather than from a coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet. Unlike prior work, this is the first application of metadata integration for wrist pathology recognition. Our results show that combining fine-grained transformer approach, fine-grained pre-training, and metadata integration improves diagnostic accuracy by 2% on small custom curated dataset and over 10% on a larger fracture dataset.</description>

      <title>Bottom-up Domain-specific Superintelligence: A Reliable Knowledge Graph is What We Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models traditionally used for cross-domain generalization have recently demonstrated task-specific reasoning. However, their top-down training approach on general corpora is insufficient for acquiring abstractions needed for deep domain expertise. This may require a bottom-up approach that acquires expertise by learning to compose simple domain concepts into more complex ones. A knowledge graph (KG) provides this compositional structure, where domain primitives are represented as head-relation-tail edges and their paths encode higher-level concepts. We present a task generation pipeline that synthesizes tasks directly from KG primitives, enabling models to acquire and compose them for reasoning. We fine-tune language models on the resultant KG-grounded curriculum to demonstrate domain-specific superintelligence. While broadly applicable, we validate our approach in medicine, where reliable KGs exist. Using a medical KG, we curate 24,000 reasoning tasks paired with thinking traces derived from diverse medical primitives. We fine-tune the QwQ-32B model on this curriculum to obtain QwQ-Med-3 that takes a step towards medical superintelligence. We also introduce ICD-Bench, an evaluation suite to quantify reasoning abilities across 15 medical domains. Our experiments demonstrate that QwQ-Med-3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on ICD-Bench categories. Further analysis reveals that QwQ-Med-3 utilizes acquired primitives to widen the performance gap on the hardest tasks of ICD-Bench. Finally, evaluation on medical question-answer benchmarks shows that QwQ-Med-3 transfers acquired expertise to enhance the base model's performance. While the industry's approach to artificial general intelligence (AGI) emphasizes broad expertise, we envision a future in which AGI emerges from the composable interaction of efficient domain-specific superintelligent agents.</description>

      <title>ExCyTIn-Bench: Evaluating LLM agents on Cyber Threat Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present ExCyTIn-Bench, the first benchmark to Evaluate an LLM agent x on the task of Cyber Threat Investigation through security questions derived from investigation graphs. Real-world security analysts must sift through a large number of heterogeneous alert signals and security logs, follow multi-hop chains of evidence, and compile an incident report. With the developments of LLMs, building LLM-based agents for automatic thread investigation is a promising direction. To assist the development and evaluation of LLM agents, we construct a dataset from a controlled Azure tenant that covers 8 simulated real-world multi-step attacks, 57 log tables from Microsoft Sentinel and related services, and 589 automatically generated questions. We leverage security logs extracted with expert-crafted detection logic to build threat investigation graphs, and then generate questions with LLMs using paired nodes on the graph, taking the start node as background context and the end node as answer. Anchoring each question to these explicit nodes and edges not only provides automatic, explainable ground truth answers but also makes the pipeline reusable and readily extensible to new logs. This also enables the automatic generation of procedural tasks with verifiable rewards, which can be naturally extended to training agents via reinforcement learning. Our comprehensive experiments with different models confirm the difficulty of the task: with the base setting, the average reward across all evaluated models is 0.249, and the best achieved is 0.368, leaving substantial headroom for future research. Code and data are coming soon!</description>

      <title>GPI-Net: Gestalt-Guided Parallel Interaction Network via Orthogonal Geometric Consistency for Robust Point Cloud Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate identification of high-quality correspondences is a prerequisite task in feature-based point cloud registration. However, it is extremely challenging to handle the fusion of local and global features due to feature redundancy and complex spatial relationships. Given that Gestalt principles provide key advantages in analyzing local and global relationships, we propose a novel Gestalt-guided Parallel Interaction Network via orthogonal geometric consistency (GPI-Net) in this paper. It utilizes Gestalt principles to facilitate complementary communication between local and global information. Specifically, we introduce an orthogonal integration strategy to optimally reduce redundant information and generate a more compact global structure for high-quality correspondences. To capture geometric features in correspondences, we leverage a Gestalt Feature Attention (GFA) block through a hybrid utilization of self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, to facilitate the integration of local detail information into the global structure, we design an innovative Dual-path Multi-Granularity parallel interaction aggregation (DMG) block to promote information exchange across different granularities. Extensive experiments on various challenging tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed GPI-Net in comparison to existing methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/gwk429/GPI-Net.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models, initially developed for image synthesis, demonstrate remarkable generative capabilities. Recently, their application has expanded to time series forecasting (TSF), yielding promising results. Existing surveys on time series primarily focus on the application of diffusion models to time series tasks or merely provide model-by-model introductions of diffusion-based TSF models, without establishing a systematic taxonomy for existing diffusion-based TSF models. In this survey, we firstly introduce several standard diffusion models and their prevalent variants, explaining their adaptation to TSF tasks. Then, we provide a comprehensive review of diffusion models for TSF, paying special attention to the sources of conditional information and the mechanisms for integrating this conditioning within the models. In analyzing existing approaches using diffusion models for TSF, we provide a systematic categorization and a comprehensive summary of them in this survey. Furthermore, we examine several foundational diffusion models applied to TSF, alongside commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss the progress and limitations of these approaches, as well as potential future research directions for diffusion-based TSF. Overall, this survey offers a comprehensive overview of recent progress and future prospects for diffusion models in TSF, serving as a valuable reference for researchers in the field.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking LLM Privacy Recognition for Social Robot Decision Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While robots have previously utilized rule-based systems or probabilistic models for user interaction, the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) presents new opportunities to develop LLM-powered robots for enhanced human-robot interaction (HRI). To fully realize these capabilities, however, robots need to collect data such as audio, fine-grained images, video, and locations. As a result, LLMs often process sensitive personal information, particularly within private environments, such as homes. Given the tension between utility and privacy risks, evaluating how current LLMs manage sensitive data is critical. Specifically, we aim to explore the extent to which out-of-the-box LLMs are privacy-aware in the context of household robots. In this work, we present a set of privacy-relevant scenarios developed using the Contextual Integrity (CI) framework. We first surveyed users' privacy preferences regarding in-home robot behaviors and then examined how their privacy orientations affected their choices of these behaviors (N = 450). We then provided the same set of scenarios and questions to state-of-the-art LLMs (N = 10) and found that the agreement between humans and LLMs was generally low. To further investigate the capabilities of LLMs as potential privacy controllers, we implemented four additional prompting strategies and compared their results. We discuss the performance of the evaluated models as well as the implications and potential of AI privacy awareness in human-robot interaction.</description>

      <title>Towards Compute-Optimal Many-Shot In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) are able to process inputs containing up to several million tokens. In the scope of in-context learning (ICL), this translates into using hundreds/thousands of demonstrations in the input prompt, enabling many-shot ICL. In practice, a fixed set of demonstrations is often selected at random in many-shot settings due to (1) high inference costs, (2) the benefits of caching and reusing computations, and (3) the similar performance offered by this strategy compared to others when scaled. In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for demonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal computational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of demonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a disproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The second strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with those selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via k-means clustering. Our experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash across several datasets indicate that our strategies consistently outperform random selection and surpass or match the most performant selection approach while supporting caching and reducing inference cost by up to an order of magnitude. We also show that adjusting the proportion of demonstrations selected based on different criteria can balance performance and inference cost in many-shot ICL.</description>

      <title>A Markov Categorical Framework for Language Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive language models achieve remarkable performance, yet a unified theory explaining their internal mechanisms--how training shapes their representations and enables complex behaviors--remains elusive. We introduce a new analytical framework that models the single-step generation process as a composition of information-processing stages using the language of Markov categories. This compositional perspective provides a unified mathematical language to connect three critical aspects of language modeling that are typically studied in isolation: the training objective, the geometry of the learned representation space, and practical model capabilities. First, our framework provides a precise information-theoretic rationale for the success of multi-token prediction methods like speculative decoding, quantifying the "information surplus" a model's hidden state contains about tokens beyond the immediate next one. Second, we clarify how the standard negative log-likelihood (NLL) objective compels the model to learn not just the next word, but also the data's intrinsic conditional uncertainty, a process we formalize using categorical entropy. Our central result reveals that NLL training functions as an implicit form of spectral contrastive learning. We prove that, for common model architectures, this simple predictive objective forces the model to sculpt a geometrically structured representation space, implicitly aligning representations with the eigenspectrum of a "predictive similarity" operator. This work offers a powerful new lens to understand how information flows through a model and how the training objective shapes its internal geometry, thereby bridging the gap between learning theory and the practical success of large language models.</description>

      <title>AR-LIF: Adaptive reset leaky integrate-and-fire neuron for spiking neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks offer low energy consumption due to their event-driven nature. Beyond binary spike outputs, their intrinsic floating-point dynamics merit greater attention. Neuronal threshold levels and reset modes critically determine spike count and timing. Hard reset cause information loss, while soft reset apply uniform treatment to neurons. To address these issues, we design an adaptive reset neuron that establishes relationships between inputs, outputs, and reset, while integrating a simple yet effective threshold adjustment strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves excellent performance while maintaining lower energy consumption. In particular, it attains state-of-the-art accuracy on Tiny-ImageNet and CIFAR10-DVS. Codes are available at https://github.com/2ephyrus/AR-LIF.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Application of Visual Question Answering (VQA) for Classroom Activity Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classroom behavior monitoring is a critical aspect of educational research, with significant implications for student engagement and learning outcomes. Recent advancements in Visual Question Answering (VQA) models offer promising tools for automatically analyzing complex classroom interactions from video recordings. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of several state-of-the-art open-source VQA models, including LLaMA2, LLaMA3, QWEN3, and NVILA, in the context of classroom behavior analysis. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce our BAV-Classroom-VQA dataset derived from real-world classroom video recordings at the Banking Academy of Vietnam. We present the methodology for data collection, annotation, and benchmark the performance of the selected VQA models on this dataset. Our initial experimental results demonstrate that all four models achieve promising performance levels in answering behavior-related visual questions, showcasing their potential in future classroom analytics and intervention systems.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Aggregation-Broadcast in LoRA-enabled Distributed Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized data sources while preserving data privacy. However, the growing size of Machine Learning (ML) models poses communication and computation challenges in FL. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently been introduced into FL as an efficient fine-tuning method, reducing communication overhead by updating only a small number of trainable parameters. Despite its effectiveness, how to aggregate LoRA-updated local models on the server remains a critical and understudied problem. In this paper, we provide a unified convergence analysis for LoRA-based FL. We first categories the current aggregation method into two major type: Sum-Product (SP) and Product-Sum (PS). Then we formally define the Aggregation-Broadcast Operator (ABO) and derive both weak and strong convergence condition under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we present both weak and strong convergence condition that guarantee convergence of the local model and the global model respectively. These theoretical analyze offer a principled understanding of various aggregation strategies. Notably, we prove that the SP and PS aggregation methods satisfy the weak and strong convergence condition respectively, but differ in their ability to achieve the optimal convergence rate. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A DbC Inspired Neurosymbolic Layer for Trustworthy Agent Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), produce fluent outputs yet lack verifiable guarantees. We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs, coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance. The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two agents satisfying the same contracts are \emph{functionally equivalent} with respect to those contracts.</description>

      <title>MSC: A Marine Wildlife Video Dataset with Grounded Segmentation and Clip-Level Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Marine videos present significant challenges for video understanding due to the dynamics of marine objects and the surrounding environment, camera motion, and the complexity of underwater scenes. Existing video captioning datasets, typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize to the complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine life. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and segmentation masks to facilitate visual grounding and captioning, leading to improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine video generation. Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to detect salient object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich the semantics of captioning content. Our dataset and code have been released at https://msc.hkustvgd.com.</description>

      <title>CF3: Compact and Fast 3D Feature Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has begun incorporating rich information from 2D foundation models. However, most approaches rely on a bottom-up optimization process that treats raw 2D features as ground truth, incurring increased computational costs. We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the autoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we introduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian attributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric details. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little as 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.</description>

      <title>Grid-Agent: An LLM-Powered Multi-Agent System for Power Grid Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs), and the growing frequency of extreme weather events have significantly increased the complexity of power grid planning, operation, and management. Traditional rule-based systems and numerical optimization approaches often struggle with the scale, dynamics, and adaptability required by modern power networks. This paper introduces Grid-Agent, an autonomous, AI-driven framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with multi-agent reinforcement learning to detect and remediate grid violations in real time. Grid-Agent integrates semantic reasoning with numerical precision through a modular agent architecture: a planning agent generates coordinated action sequences using numerical power flow solvers, while a validation agent evaluates system stability and action effectiveness via sandboxed execution with safety rollbacks. To ensure scalability, Grid-Agent incorporates an adaptive multiscale network representation that dynamically selects optimal encoding schemes based on network size and complexity. The framework enables coordinated violation resolution through optimizing switch configurations, battery deployment, and load curtailment strategies. Experimental results in standard IEEE and CIGRE test systems (IEEE 69-bus, CIGRE MV, and IEEE 30-bus) demonstrate superior violation mitigation performance. Additionally, the framework's built-in data collection and learning capabilities enable continuous learning and adaptation to diverse network topologies. The autonomous nature of the framework makes it particularly suitable for modern smart grid applications requiring rapid response to dynamic operating conditions.</description>

      <title>LLM Serving Optimization with Variable Prefill and Decode Lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of serving LLM (Large Language Model) requests where each request has heterogeneous prefill and decode lengths. In LLM serving, the prefill length corresponds to the input prompt length, which determines the initial memory usage in the KV cache. The decode length refers to the number of output tokens generated sequentially, with each additional token increasing the KV cache memory usage by one unit. Given a set of n requests, our goal is to schedule and process them to minimize the total completion time. We show that this problem is NP-hard due to the interplay of batching, placement constraints, precedence relationships, and linearly increasing memory usage. We then analyze commonly used scheduling strategies in practice, such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Shortest-First (SF), and prove that their competitive ratios scale up sublinearly with the memory limit-a significant drawback in real-world settings where memory demand is large. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm based on a new selection metric that efficiently forms batches over time. We prove that this algorithm achieves a constant competitive ratio. Finally, we develop and evaluate a few algorithm variants inspired by this approach, including dynamic programming variants, local search methods, and an LP-based scheduler, demonstrating through comprehensive simulations that they outperform standard baselines while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Class Unbiasing for Generalization in Medical Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical diagnosis might fail due to bias. In this work, we identified class-feature bias, which refers to models' potential reliance on features that are strongly correlated with only a subset of classes, leading to biased performance and poor generalization on other classes. We aim to train a class-unbiased model (Cls-unbias) that mitigates both class imbalance and class-feature bias simultaneously. Specifically, we propose a class-wise inequality loss which promotes equal contributions of classification loss from positive-class and negative-class samples. We propose to optimize a class-wise group distributionally robust optimization objective-a class-weighted training objective that upweights underperforming classes-to enhance the effectiveness of the inequality loss under class imbalance. Through synthetic and real-world datasets, we empirically demonstrate that class-feature bias can negatively impact model performance. Our proposed method effectively mitigates both class-feature bias and class imbalance, thereby improving the model's generalization ability.</description>

      <title>MAQuA: Adaptive Question-Asking for Multidimensional Mental Health Screening using Item Response Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for scalable, interactive mental health assessment, but excessive querying by LLMs burdens users and is inefficient for real-world screening across transdiagnostic symptom profiles. We introduce MAQuA, an adaptive question-asking framework for simultaneous, multidimensional mental health screening. Combining multi-outcome modeling on language responses with item response theory (IRT) and factor analysis, MAQuA selects the questions with most informative responses across multiple dimensions at each turn to optimize diagnostic information, improving accuracy and potentially reducing response burden. Empirical results on a novel dataset reveal that MAQuA reduces the number of assessment questions required for score stabilization by 50-87% compared to random ordering (e.g., achieving stable depression scores with 71% fewer questions and eating disorder scores with 85% fewer questions). MAQuA demonstrates robust performance across both internalizing (depression, anxiety) and externalizing (substance use, eating disorder) domains, with early stopping strategies further reducing patient time and burden. These findings position MAQuA as a powerful and efficient tool for scalable, nuanced, and interactive mental health screening, advancing the integration of LLM-based agents into real-world clinical workflows.</description>

      <title>ACD-CLIP: Decoupling Representation and Dynamic Fusion for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07819v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) due to a critical adaptation gap: they lack the local inductive biases required for dense prediction and employ inflexible feature fusion paradigms. We address these limitations through an Architectural Co-Design framework that jointly refines feature representation and cross-modal fusion. Our method proposes a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation models to dense perception tasks.</description>

      <title>Grid2Guide: A* Enabled Small Language Model for Indoor Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable indoor navigation remains a significant challenge in complex environments, particularly where external positioning signals and dedicated infrastructures are unavailable. This research presents Grid2Guide, a hybrid navigation framework that combines the A* search algorithm with a Small Language Model (SLM) to generate clear, human-readable route instructions. The framework first conducts a binary occupancy matrix from a given indoor map. Using this matrix, the A* algorithm computes the optimal path between origin and destination, producing concise textual navigation steps. These steps are then transformed into natural language instructions by the SLM, enhancing interpretability for end users. Experimental evaluations across various indoor scenarios demonstrate the method's effectiveness in producing accurate and timely navigation guidance. The results validate the proposed approach as a lightweight, infrastructure-free solution for real-time indoor navigation support.</description>

      <title>UQGNN: Uncertainty Quantification of Graph Neural Networks for Multivariate Spatiotemporal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal prediction plays a critical role in numerous real-world applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, disaster response, and pandemic control. In recent years, researchers have made significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic, i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty, leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes), thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and (ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5% improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09632v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper-to-video task converts a research paper into a structured video abstract, distilling key concepts, methods, and conclusions into an accessible, well-organized format. While state-of-the-art video generation models demonstrate potential, they are constrained by limited context windows, rigid video duration constraints, limited stylistic diversity, and an inability to represent domain-specific knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce Preacher, the first paper-to-video agentic system. Preacher employs a topdown approach to decompose, summarize, and reformulate the paper, followed by bottom-up video generation, synthesizing diverse video segments into a coherent abstract. To align cross-modal representations, we define key scenes and introduce a Progressive Chain of Thought (P-CoT) for granular, iterative planning. Preacher successfully generates high-quality video abstracts across five research fields, demonstrating expertise beyond current video generation models.

      <title>BConformeR: A Conformer Based on Mutual Sampling for Unified Prediction of Continuous and Discontinuous Antibody Binding Sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-binding sites (epitopes) on antigens is crucial for vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, therapeutic antibody development, antibody engineering, research into autoimmune and allergic diseases, and for advancing our understanding of immune responses. Despite in silico methods that have been proposed to predict both linear (continuous) and conformational (discontinuous) epitopes, they consistently underperform in predicting conformational epitopes. In this work, we propose a conformer-based model trained on antigen sequences derived from 1,080 antigen-antibody complexes, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract local features and Transformers to capture long-range dependencies within antigen sequences. Ablation studies demonstrate that CNN enhances the prediction of linear epitopes, and the Transformer module improves the prediction of conformational epitopes. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing baselines in terms of PCC, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and F1 scores on both linear and conformational epitopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The flow matching has rapidly become a dominant paradigm in classical generative modeling, offering an efficient way to interpolate between two complex distributions. We extend this idea to the quantum realm and introduce the Quantum Flow Matching (QFM-a fully quantum-circuit realization that offers efficient interpolation between two density matrices. QFM offers systematic preparation of density matrices and generation of samples for accurately estimating observables, and can be realized on quantum computers without the need for costly circuit redesigns. We validate its versatility on a set of applications: (i) generating target states with prescribed magnetization and entanglement entropy, (ii) estimating nonequilibrium free-energy differences to test the quantum Jarzynski equality, and (iii) expediting the study on superdiffusion. These results position QFM as a unifying and promising framework for generative modeling across quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Learning local and global prototypes with optimal transport for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection aims to detect defective parts of a sample by having access, during training, to a set of normal, i.e. defect-free, data. It has many applications in fields, such as industrial inspection or medical imaging, where acquiring labels is costly or when we want to avoid introducing biases in the type of anomalies that can be spotted. In this work, we propose a novel UAD method based on prototype learning and introduce a metric to compare a structured set of embeddings that balances a feature-based cost and a spatial-based cost. We leverage this metric to learn local and global prototypes with optimal transport from latent representations extracted with a pre-trained image encoder. We demonstrate that our approach can enforce a structural constraint when learning the prototypes, allowing to capture the underlying organization of the normal samples, thus improving the detection of incoherencies in images. Our model achieves performance that is on par with strong baselines on two reference benchmarks for anomaly detection on industrial images.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Evaluation Function: A Multi-Metric Approach for Optimizing Demand Forecasting Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inventory management in dynamic and competitive business environments presents multidimensional challenges, particularly in the face of demand uncertainty and logistical and financial constraints. In this context, accurate demand forecasting is critical for optimizing resources and anticipating market fluctuations. However, the isolated use of traditional metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) can lead to biased evaluations and limit model robustness. To address this limitation, we propose the Hierarchical Evaluation Function (HEF), a composite function that integrates R2, MAE, and RMSE under a hierarchical and dynamic framework, complemented by adaptive penalties. The study implements HEF in the optimization of multiple prediction models, applying Grid Search, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Optuna, and evaluating their performance on reference databases (Walmart, M3, M4, and M5). The results, validated using statistical tests, confirm that HEF consistently outperforms the MAE used as the evaluation function in global metrics such as R2, Global Relative Precision, RMSE, and RMSSE, improving explanatory power and stability against extreme errors. In contrast, the MAE retains advantages in simplicity and computational efficiency. In summary, HEF constitutes a robust and adaptive alternative for highly variable environments, providing a solid framework for model selection and hyperparameter optimization.</description>

      <title>FLAIR: Frequency- and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13544v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency- and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.</description>

      <title>NVIDIA Nemotron Nano 2: An Accurate and Efficient Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Reasoning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14444v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model designed to increase throughput for reasoning workloads while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy compared to similarly-sized models. Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 builds on the Nemotron-H architecture, in which the majority of the self-attention layers in the common Transformer architecture are replaced with Mamba-2 layers, to achieve improved inference speed when generating the long thinking traces needed for reasoning. We create Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 by first pre-training a 12-billion-parameter model (Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base) on 20 trillion tokens using an FP8 training recipe. After aligning Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, we employ the Minitron strategy to compress and distill the model with the goal of enabling inference on up to 128k tokens on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU (22GiB of memory, bfloat16 precision). Compared to existing similarly-sized models (e.g., Qwen3-8B), we show that Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 achieves on-par or better accuracy on reasoning benchmarks while achieving up to 6x higher inference throughput in reasoning settings like 8k input and 16k output tokens. We are releasing Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, Nemotron-Nano12B-v2-Base, and Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base checkpoints along with the majority of our pre- and post-training datasets on Hugging Face.</description>

      <title>Adaptively Robust LLM Inference Optimization under Prediction Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference scheduling to minimize total latency. LLM inference is an online and multi-task service process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM processes input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore, it is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power consumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key challenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known upon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and processing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms that leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the prediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each request.
  We first design a conservative algorithm, $\mathcal{A}_{\max}$, which schedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to prevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as prediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to potential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted lower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during inferencing. We prove that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ achieves a log-scale competitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler, highlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios. Moreover, $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the prediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output length are typically more challenging to predict accurately.</description>

      <title>SparK: Query-Aware Unstructured Sparsity with Recoverable KV Cache Channel Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis), thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques, making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration. By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/SparK.</description>

      <title>Bridging Generalization and Personalization in Wearable Human Activity Recognition via On-Device Few-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with wearable devices requires both strong generalization across diverse users and efficient personalization for individuals. However, conventional HAR models often fail to generalize when faced with user-specific variations, leading to degraded performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel on-device few-shot learning framework that bridges generalization and personalization in wearable HAR. Our method first trains a generalizable representation across users and then rapidly adapts to new users with only a few labeled samples, updating lightweight classifier layers directly on resource-constrained devices. This approach achieves robust on-device learning with minimal computation and memory cost, making it practical for real-world deployment. We implement our framework on the energy-efficient RISC-V GAP9 microcontroller and evaluate it on three benchmark datasets (RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, Ultrasound-Gesture). Across these scenarios, post-deployment adaptation improves accuracy by 3.73%, 17.38%, and 3.70%, respectively. These results demonstrate that few-shot on-device learning enables scalable, user-aware, and energy-efficient wearable human activity recognition by seamlessly uniting generalization and personalization \footnote{https://github.com/kangpx/onlineTiny2023}.</description>

      <title>GPT-OSS-20B: A Comprehensive Deployment-Centric Analysis of OpenAI's Open-Weight Mixture of Experts Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a single-GPU (H100, bf16) evaluation of GPT-OSS-20B (Mixture-of-Experts; 20.9B total, approx. 3.61B active) against dense baselines Qwen3-32B and Yi-34B across multiple dimensions. We measure true time-to-first-token (TTFT), full-decode throughput (TPOT), end-to-end latency percentiles, peak VRAM with past key values (PKV) held, and energy via a consistent nvidia-smi-based sampler. At a 2048-token context with 64-token decode, GPT-OSS-20B delivers higher decode throughput and tokens per Joule than dense baselines Qwen3-32B and Yi-34B, while substantially reducing peak VRAM and energy per 1000 generated tokens; its TTFT is higher due to MoE routing overhead. With only 17.3% of parameters active (3.61B of 20.9B), GPT-OSS-20B provides about 31.8% higher decode throughput and 25.8% lower energy per 1000 generated tokens than Qwen3-32B at 2048/64, while using 31.7% less peak VRAM. Normalized by active parameters, GPT-OSS-20B shows markedly stronger per-active-parameter efficiency (APE), underscoring MoE's deployment advantages. We do not evaluate accuracy; this is a deployment-focused study. We release code and consolidated results to enable replication and extension.</description>

      <title>Tri-Accel: Curvature-Aware Precision-Adaptive and Memory-Elastic Optimization for Efficient GPU Usage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly bottlenecked by the cost of optimization, both in terms of GPU memory and compute time. Existing acceleration techniques, such as mixed precision, second-order methods, and batch size scaling, are typically used in isolation. We present Tri-Accel, a unified optimization framework that co-adapts three acceleration strategies along with adaptive parameters during training: (1) Precision-Adaptive Updates that dynamically assign mixed-precision levels to layers based on curvature and gradient variance; (2) Sparse Second-Order Signals that exploit Hessian/Fisher sparsity patterns to guide precision and step size decisions; and (3) Memory-Elastic Batch Scaling that adjusts batch size in real time according to VRAM availability. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0, Tri-Accel achieves up to 9.9% reduction in training time and 13.3% lower memory usage, while improving accuracy by +1.1 percentage points over FP32 baselines. Tested on CIFAR-10/100, our approach demonstrates adaptive learning behavior, with efficiency gradually improving over the course of training as the system learns to allocate resources more effectively. Compared to static mixed-precision training, Tri-Accel maintains 78.1% accuracy while reducing memory footprint from 0.35GB to 0.31GB on standard hardware. The framework is implemented with custom Triton kernels, whose hardware-aware adaptation enables automatic optimization without manual hyperparameter tuning, making it practical for deployment across diverse computational environments. This work demonstrates how algorithmic adaptivity and hardware awareness can be combined to improve scalability in resource-constrained settings, paving the way for more efficient neural network training on edge devices and cost-sensitive cloud deployments.</description>

      <title>ONG: Orthogonal Natural Gradient Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal Gradient Descent (OGD) has emerged as a powerful method for continual learning. However, its Euclidean projections do not leverage the underlying information-geometric structure of the problem, which can lead to suboptimal convergence in learning tasks. To address this, we propose incorporating the natural gradient into OGD and present \textbf{ONG (Orthogonal Natural Gradient Descent)}. ONG preconditions each new task-specific gradient with an efficient EKFAC approximation of the inverse Fisher information matrix, yielding updates that follow the steepest descent direction under a Riemannian metric. To preserve performance on previously learned tasks, ONG projects these natural gradients onto the orthogonal complement of prior tasks' gradients. We provide an initial theoretical justification for this procedure, introduce the Orthogonal Natural Gradient Descent (ONG) algorithm, and present preliminary results on the Permuted and Rotated MNIST benchmarks. Our preliminary results, however, indicate that a naive combination of natural gradients and orthogonal projections can have potential issues. This finding motivates continued future work focused on robustly reconciling these geometric perspectives to develop a continual learning method, establishing a more rigorous theoretical foundation with formal convergence guarantees, and extending empirical validation to large-scale continual learning benchmarks.

      <title>LLM Assertiveness can be Mechanistically Decomposed into Emotional and Logical Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often display overconfidence, presenting information with unwarranted certainty in high-stakes contexts. We investigate the internal basis of this behavior via mechanistic interpretability. Using open-sourced Llama 3.2 models fine-tuned on human annotated assertiveness datasets, we extract residual activations across all layers, and compute similarity metrics to localize assertive representations. Our analysis identifies layers most sensitive to assertiveness contrasts and reveals that high-assertive representations decompose into two orthogonal sub-components of emotional and logical clusters-paralleling the dual-route Elaboration Likelihood Model in Psychology. Steering vectors derived from these sub-components show distinct causal effects: emotional vectors broadly influence prediction accuracy, while logical vectors exert more localized effects. These findings provide mechanistic evidence for the multi-component structure of LLM assertiveness and highlight avenues for mitigating overconfident behavior.</description>

      <title>CoViPAL: Layer-wise Contextualized Visual Token Pruning for Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process multimodal inputs consisting of text tokens and vision tokens extracted from images or videos. Due to the rich visual information, a single image can generate thousands of vision tokens, leading to high computational costs during the prefilling stage and significant memory overhead during decoding. Existing methods attempt to prune redundant vision tokens, revealing substantial redundancy in visual representations. However, these methods often struggle in shallow layers due to the lack of sufficient contextual information. We argue that many visual tokens are inherently redundant even in shallow layers and can be safely and effectively pruned with appropriate contextual signals. In this work, we propose CoViPAL, a layer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that employs a Plug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision tokens before they are processed by the LVLM. The PPM is lightweight, model-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring seamless integration with various models. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods under equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable supervision. CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution to improve inference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI for Software: thoughts from Software Engineering community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17343</link>

Abstract: AI agents have recently shown significant promise in software engineering. Much public attention has been transfixed on the topic of code generation from Large Language Models (LLMs) via a prompt. However, software engineering is much more than programming, and AI agents go far beyond instructions given by a prompt.
  At the code level, common software tasks include code generation, testing, and program repair. Design level software tasks may include architecture exploration, requirements understanding, and requirements enforcement at the code level. Each of these software tasks involves micro-decisions which can be taken autonomously by an AI agent, aided by program analysis tools. This creates the vision of an AI software engineer, where the AI agent can be seen as a member of a development team.
  Conceptually, the key to successfully developing trustworthy agentic AI-based software workflows will be to resolve the core difficulty in software engineering - the deciphering and clarification of developer intent. Specification inference, or deciphering the intent, thus lies at the heart of many software tasks, including software maintenance and program repair. A successful deployment of agentic technology into software engineering would involve making conceptual progress in such intent inference via agents.
  Trusting the AI agent becomes a key aspect, as software engineering becomes more automated. Higher automation also leads to higher volume of code being automatically generated, and then integrated into code-bases. Thus to deal with this explosion, an emerging direction is AI-based verification and validation (V &amp; V) of AI generated code. We posit that agentic software workflows in future will include such AIbased V&amp;V.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Fusion Multimodal Network for SpeechWellness Detection</title>

Abstract: Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among adolescents. Previous suicide risk prediction studies have primarily focused on either textual or acoustic information in isolation, the integration of multimodal signals, such as speech and text, offers a more comprehensive understanding of an individual's mental state. Motivated by this, and in the context of the 1st SpeechWellness detection challenge, we explore a lightweight multi-branch multimodal system based on a dynamic fusion mechanism for speechwellness detection. To address the limitation of prior approaches that rely on time-domain waveforms for acoustic analysis, our system incorporates both time-domain and time-frequency (TF) domain acoustic features, as well as semantic representations. In addition, we introduce a dynamic fusion block to adaptively integrate information from different modalities. Specifically, it applies learnable weights to each modality during the fusion process, enabling the model to adjust the contribution of each modality. To enhance computational efficiency, we design a lightweight structure by simplifying the original baseline model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system exhibits superior performance compared to the challenge baseline, achieving a 78% reduction in model parameters and a 5% improvement in accuracy.</description>

      <title>DrugReasoner: Interpretable Drug Approval Prediction with a Reasoning-augmented Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drug discovery is a complex and resource-intensive process, making early prediction of approval outcomes critical for optimizing research investments. While classical machine learning and deep learning methods have shown promise in drug approval prediction, their limited interpretability constraints their impact. Here, we present DrugReasoner, a reasoning-based large language model (LLM) built on the LLaMA architecture and fine-tuned with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to predict the likelihood of small-molecule approval. DrugReasoner integrates molecular descriptors with comparative reasoning against structurally similar approved and unapproved compounds, generating predictions alongside step-by-step rationales and confidence scores. DrugReasoner achieved robust performance with an AUC of 0.732 and an F1 score of 0.729 on the validation set and 0.725 and 0.718 on the test set, respectively. These results outperformed conventional baselines, including logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors and had competitive performance relative to XGBoost. On an external independent dataset, DrugReasoner outperformed both baseline and the recently developed ChemAP model, achieving an AUC of 0.728 and an F1-score of 0.774, while maintaining high precision and balanced sensitivity, demonstrating robustness in real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate that DrugReasoner not only delivers competitive predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency through its reasoning outputs, thereby addressing a key bottleneck in AI-assisted drug discovery. This study highlights the potential of reasoning-augmented LLMs as interpretable and effective tools for pharmaceutical decision-making.</description>

      <title>SPGrasp: Spatiotemporal Prompt-driven Grasp Synthesis in Dynamic Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time interactive grasp synthesis for dynamic objects remains challenging as existing methods fail to achieve low-latency inference while maintaining promptability. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGrasp (spatiotemporal prompt-driven dynamic grasp synthesis), a novel framework extending segment anything model v2 (SAMv2) for video stream grasp estimation. Our core innovation integrates user prompts with spatiotemporal context, enabling real-time interaction with end-to-end latency as low as 59 ms while ensuring temporal consistency for dynamic objects. In benchmark evaluations, SPGrasp achieves instance-level grasp accuracies of 90.6% on OCID and 93.8% on Jacquard. On the challenging GraspNet-1Billion dataset under continuous tracking, SPGrasp achieves 92.0% accuracy with 73.1 ms per-frame latency, representing a 58.5% reduction compared to the prior state-of-the-art promptable method RoG-SAM while maintaining competitive accuracy. Real-world experiments involving 13 moving objects demonstrate a 94.8% success rate in interactive grasping scenarios. These results confirm SPGrasp effectively resolves the latency-interactivity trade-off in dynamic grasp synthesis.</description>

      <title>Occlusion Robustness of CLIP for Military Vehicle Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around 35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for real-world deployment of CLIP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability, making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages. Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.</description>

      <title>EmbodiedOneVision: Interleaved Vision-Text-Action Pretraining for General Robot Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The human ability to seamlessly perform multimodal reasoning and physical interaction in the open world is a core goal for general-purpose embodied intelligent systems. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work, introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive, high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for developing advanced embodied foundation models.</description>

      <title>R-4B: Incentivizing General-Purpose Auto-Thinking Capability in MLLMs via Bi-Mode Annealing and Reinforce Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply Bi-mode Policy Optimization (BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query. Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower computational cost.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Label-Induced Bias in Large Language Model Self- and Cross-Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions: no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini" label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings. Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.</description>

      <title>ELV-Halluc: Benchmarking Semantic Aggregation Hallucinations in Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs. Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination. To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.</description>
