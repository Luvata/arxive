      <title>Psychological Counseling Ability of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of science and the continuous progress of artificial intelligence technology, Large Language Models (LLMs) have begun to be widely utilized across various fields. However, in the field of psychological counseling, the ability of LLMs have not been systematically assessed. In this study, we assessed the psychological counseling ability of mainstream LLMs using 1096 psychological counseling skill questions which were selected from the Chinese National Counselor Level 3 Examination, including Knowledge-based, Analytical-based, and Application-based question types. The analysis showed that the correctness rates of the LLMs for Chinese questions, in descending order, were GLM-3 (46.5%), GPT-4 (46.1%), Gemini (45.0%), ERNIE-3.5 (45.7%) and GPT-3.5 (32.9%). The correctness rates of the LLMs for English questions, in descending order, were ERNIE-3.5 (43.9%), GPT-4 (40.6%), Gemini (36.6%), GLM-3 (29.9%) and GPT-3.5 (29.5%). A chi-square test indicated significant differences in the LLMs' performance on Chinese and English questions. Furthermore, we subsequently utilized the Counselor's Guidebook (Level 3) as a reference for ERNIE-3.5, resulting in a new correctness rate of 59.6%, a 13.8% improvement over its initial rate of 45.8%. In conclusion, the study assessed the psychological counseling ability of LLMs for the first time, which may provide insights for future enhancement and improvement of psychological counseling ability of LLMs.</description>

      <title>FourierNAT: A Fourier-Mixing-Based Non-Autoregressive Transformer for Parallel Sequence Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present FourierNAT, a novel non-autoregressive Transformer (NAT) architecture that employs Fourier-based mixing in the decoder to generate output sequences in parallel. While traditional NAT approaches often face challenges with capturing global dependencies, our method leverages a discrete Fourier transform to mix token embeddings across the entire sequence dimension, coupled with learned frequency-domain gating. This allows the model to efficiently propagate context without explicit autoregressive steps. Empirically, FourierNAT achieves competitive results against leading NAT baselines on standard benchmarks like WMT machine translation and CNN/DailyMail summarization, providing significant speed advantages over autoregressive Transformers. We further demonstrate that learned frequency-domain parameters allow the model to adaptively focus on long-range or short-range dependencies, partially mitigating the well-known coherence gaps in one-pass NAT generation. Overall, FourierNAT highlights the potential of integrating spectral-domain operations to accelerate and improve parallel text generation. This approach can potentially provide great computational and time savings in inference tasks LLMs.</description>

      <title>OWLViz: An Open-World Benchmark for Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a challenging benchmark for the Open WorLd VISual question answering (OWLViz) task. OWLViz presents concise, unambiguous queries that require integrating multiple capabilities, including visual understanding, web exploration, and specialized tool usage. While humans achieve 69.2% accuracy on these intuitive tasks, even state-of-the-art VLMs struggle, with the best model, Gemini 2.0, achieving only 26.6% accuracy. Current agentic VLMs, which rely on limited vision and vision-language models as tools, perform even worse. This performance gap reveals significant limitations in multimodal systems' ability to select appropriate tools and execute complex reasoning sequences, establishing new directions for advancing practical AI research.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Neural Network Transfer-Learning Model for Forecasting Problems with Continuous and Discrete Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a continuous-variable quantum neural network (CV-QNN) model designed as a transfer-learning approach for forecasting problems. The proposed quantum technique features a simple structure with only eight trainable parameters, a single quantum layer with two wires to create entanglement, and ten quantum gates, hence the name QNNet10, effectively mimicking the functionality of classical neural networks. A notable aspect is that the quantum network achieves high accuracy with random initialization after a single iteration. This pretrained model is innovative as it requires no training or parameter tuning when applied to new datasets, allowing for parameter freezing while enabling the addition of a final layer for fine-tuning. Additionally, an equivalent discrete-variable quantum neural network (DV-QNN) is presented, structured similarly to the CV model. However, analysis shows that the two-wire DV model does not significantly enhance performance. As a result, a four-wire DV model is proposed, achieving comparable results but requiring a larger and more complex structure with additional gates. The pretrained model is applied to five forecasting problems of varying sizes, demonstrating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal Causal Relation Alignment for Video Question Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video question grounding (VideoQG) requires models to answer the questions and simultaneously infer the relevant video segments to support the answers. However, existing VideoQG methods usually suffer from spurious cross-modal correlations, leading to a failure to identify the dominant visual scenes that align with the intended question. Moreover, vision-language models exhibit unfaithful generalization performance and lack robustness on challenging downstream tasks such as VideoQG. In this work, we propose a novel VideoQG framework named Cross-modal Causal Relation Alignment (CRA), to eliminate spurious correlations and improve the causal consistency between question-answering and video temporal grounding. Our CRA involves three essential components: i) Gaussian Smoothing Grounding (GSG) module for estimating the time interval via cross-modal attention, which is de-noised by an adaptive Gaussian filter, ii) Cross-Modal Alignment (CMA) enhances the performance of weakly supervised VideoQG by leveraging bidirectional contrastive learning between estimated video segments and QA features, iii) Explicit Causal Intervention (ECI) module for multimodal deconfounding, which involves front-door intervention for vision and back-door intervention for language. Extensive experiments on two VideoQG datasets demonstrate the superiority of our CRA in discovering visually grounded content and achieving robust question reasoning.

      <title>An Optimization Algorithm for Multimodal Data Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the data era, the integration of multiple data types, known as multimodality, has become a key area of interest in the research community. This interest is driven by the goal to develop cutting edge multimodal models capable of serving as adaptable reasoning engines across a wide range of modalities and domains. Despite the fervent development efforts, the challenge of optimally representing different forms of data within a single unified latent space a crucial step for enabling effective multimodal reasoning has not been fully addressed. To bridge this gap, we introduce AlignXpert, an optimization algorithm inspired by Kernel CCA crafted to maximize the similarities between N modalities while imposing some other constraints. This work demonstrates the impact on improving data representation for a variety of reasoning tasks, such as retrieval and classification, underlining the pivotal importance of data representation.</description>

      <title>Is Pre-training Applicable to the Decoder for Dense Prediction?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained encoders are widely employed in dense prediction tasks for their capability to effectively extract visual features from images. The decoder subsequently processes these features to generate pixel-level predictions. However, due to structural differences and variations in input data, only encoders benefit from pre-learned representations from vision benchmarks such as image classification and self-supervised learning, while decoders are typically trained from scratch. In this paper, we introduce $\times$Net, which facilitates a "pre-trained encoder $\times$ pre-trained decoder" collaboration through three innovative designs. $\times$Net enables the direct utilization of pre-trained models within the decoder, integrating pre-learned representations into the decoding process to enhance performance in dense prediction tasks. By simply coupling the pre-trained encoder and pre-trained decoder, $\times$Net distinguishes itself as a highly promising approach. Remarkably, it achieves this without relying on decoding-specific structures or task-specific algorithms. Despite its streamlined design, $\times$Net outperforms advanced methods in tasks such as monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance particularly in monocular depth estimation. and semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results, especially in monocular depth estimation. embedding algorithms. Despite its streamlined design, $\times$Net outperforms advanced methods in tasks such as monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance particularly in monocular depth estimation.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Taxonomy Similarity for Next Activity Prediction in Patient Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid progress in modern medicine presents physicians with complex challenges when planning patient treatment. Techniques from the field of Predictive Business Process Monitoring, like Next-activity-prediction (NAP) can be used as a promising technique to support physicians in treatment planning, by proposing a possible next treatment step. Existing patient data, often in the form of electronic health records, can be analyzed to recommend the next suitable step in the treatment process. However, the use of patient data poses many challenges due to its knowledge-intensive character, high variability and scarcity of medical data. To overcome these challenges, this article examines the use of the knowledge encoded in taxonomies to improve and explain the prediction of the next activity in the treatment process. This study proposes the TS4NAP approach, which uses medical taxonomies (ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS) in combination with graph matching to assess the similarities of medical codes to predict the next treatment step. The effectiveness of the proposed approach will be evaluated using event logs that are derived from the MIMIC-IV dataset. The results highlight the potential of using domain-specific knowledge held in taxonomies to improve the prediction of the next activity, and thus can improve treatment planning and decision-making by making the predictions more explainable.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Experts Made Intrinsically Interpretable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurons in large language models often exhibit \emph{polysemanticity}, simultaneously encoding multiple unrelated concepts and obscuring interpretability. Instead of relying on post-hoc methods, we present \textbf{MoE-X}, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model designed to be \emph{intrinsically} interpretable. Our approach is motivated by the observation that, in language models, wider networks with sparse activations are more likely to capture interpretable factors. However, directly training such large sparse networks is computationally prohibitive. MoE architectures offer a scalable alternative by activating only a subset of experts for any given input, inherently aligning with interpretability objectives. In MoE-X, we establish this connection by rewriting the MoE layer as an equivalent sparse, large MLP. This approach enables efficient scaling of the hidden size while maintaining sparsity. To further enhance interpretability, we enforce sparse activation within each expert and redesign the routing mechanism to prioritize experts with the highest activation sparsity. These designs ensure that only the most salient features are routed and processed by the experts. We evaluate MoE-X on chess and natural language tasks, showing that it achieves performance comparable to dense models while significantly improving interpretability. MoE-X achieves a perplexity better than GPT-2, with interpretability surpassing even sparse autoencoder (SAE)-based approaches.</description>

      <title>BrainNet-MoE: Brain-Inspired Mixture-of-Experts Learning for Neurological Disease Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the second most common neurodegenerative dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD). Early differentiation between AD and LBD is crucial because they require different treatment approaches, but this is challenging due to significant clinical overlap, heterogeneity, complex pathogenesis, and the rarity of LBD. While recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) demonstrate powerful learning capabilities and offer new hope for accurate diagnosis, existing methods primarily focus on designing "neural-level networks". Our work represents a pioneering effort in modeling system-level artificial neural network called BrainNet-MoE for brain modeling and diagnosing. Inspired by the brain's hierarchical organization of bottom-up sensory integration and top-down control, we design a set of disease-specific expert groups to process brain sub-network under different condition, A disease gate mechanism guides the specializa-tion of expert groups, while a transformer layer enables communication be-tween all sub-networks, generating a comprehensive whole-brain represen-tation for downstream disease classification. Experimental results show superior classification accuracy with interpretable insights into how brain sub-networks contribute to different neurodegenerative conditions.</description>

      <title>Deep ARTMAP: Generalized Hierarchical Learning with Adaptive Resonance Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Deep ARTMAP, a novel extension of the ARTMAP architecture that generalizes the self-consistent modular ART (SMART) architecture to enable hierarchical learning (supervised and unsupervised) across arbitrary transformations of data. The Deep ARTMAP framework operates as a divisive clustering mechanism, supporting an arbitrary number of modules with customizable granularity within each module. Inter-ART modules regulate the clustering at each layer, permitting unsupervised learning while enforcing a one-to-many mapping from clusters in one layer to the next. While Deep ARTMAP reduces to both ARTMAP and SMART in particular configurations, it offers significantly enhanced flexibility, accommodating a broader range of data transformations and learning modalities.</description>

      <title>dnamite: A Python Package for Neural Additive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive models offer accurate and interpretable predictions for tabular data, a critical tool for statistical modeling. Recent advances in Neural Additive Models (NAMs) allow these models to handle complex machine learning tasks, including feature selection and survival analysis, on large-scale data. This paper introduces dnamite, a Python package that implements NAMs for these advanced applications. dnamite provides a scikit-learn style interface to train regression, classification, and survival analysis NAMs, with built-in support for feature selection. We describe the methodology underlying dnamite, its design principles, and its implementation. Through an application to the MIMIC III clinical dataset, we demonstrate the utility of dnamite in a real-world setting where feature selection and survival analysis are both important. The package is publicly available via pip and documented at dnamite.readthedocs.io.</description>

      <title>ConstellationNet: Reinventing Spatial Clustering through GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial clustering is a crucial field, finding universal use across criminology, pathology, and urban planning. However, most spatial clustering algorithms cannot pull information from nearby nodes and suffer performance drops when dealing with higher dimensionality and large datasets, making them suboptimal for large-scale and high-dimensional clustering. Due to modern data growing in size and dimension, clustering algorithms become weaker when addressing multifaceted issues. To improve upon this, we develop ConstellationNet, a convolution neural network(CNN)-graph neural network(GNN) framework that leverages the embedding power of a CNN, the neighbor aggregation of a GNN, and a neural network's ability to deal with batched data to improve spatial clustering and classification with graph augmented predictions. ConstellationNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on both supervised classification and unsupervised clustering across several datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art classification and clustering while reducing model size and training time by up to tenfold and improving baselines by 10 times. Because of its fast training and powerful nature, ConstellationNet holds promise in fields like epidemiology and medical imaging, able to quickly train on new data to develop robust responses.</description>

      <title>BicliqueEncoder: An Efficient Method for Link Prediction in Bipartite Networks using Formal Concept Analysis and Transformer Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel and efficient method for link prediction in bipartite networks, using \textit{formal concept analysis} (FCA) and the Transformer encoder. Link prediction in bipartite networks finds practical applications in various domains such as product recommendation in online sales, and prediction of chemical-disease interaction in medical science. Since for link prediction, the topological structure of a network contains valuable information, many approaches focus on extracting structural features and then utilizing them for link prediction. Bi-cliques, as a type of structural feature of bipartite graphs, can be utilized for link prediction. Although several link prediction methods utilizing bi-cliques have been proposed and perform well in rather small datasets, all of them face challenges with scalability when dealing with large datasets since they demand substantial computational resources. This limits the practical utility of these approaches in real-world applications. To overcome the limitation, we introduce a novel approach employing iceberg concept lattices and the Transformer encoder. Our method requires fewer computational resources, making it suitable for large-scale datasets while maintaining high prediction performance. We conduct experiments on five large real-world datasets that exceed the capacity of previous bi-clique-based approaches to demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Additionally, we perform supplementary experiments on five small datasets to compare with the previous bi-clique-based methods for bipartite link prediction and demonstrate that our method is more efficient than the previous ones.</description>

      <title>On the Importance of Clearsky Model in Short-Term Solar Radiation Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clearsky models are widely used in solar energy for many applications such as quality control, resource assessment, satellite-base irradiance estimation and forecasting. However, their use in forecasting and nowcasting is associated with a number of challenges. Synchronization errors, reliance on the Clearsky index (ratio of the global horizontal irradiance to its cloud-free counterpart) and high sensitivity of the clearsky model to errors in aerosol optical depth at low solar elevation limit their added value in real-time applications. This paper explores the feasibility of short-term forecasting without relying on a clearsky model. We propose a Clearsky-Free forecasting approach using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) models. ELM learns daily periodicity and local variability directly from raw Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) data. It eliminates the need for Clearsky normalization, simplifying the forecasting process and improving scalability. Our approach is a non-linear adaptative statistical method that implicitely learns the irradiance in cloud-free conditions removing the need for an clear-sky model and the related operational issues. Deterministic and probabilistic results are compared to traditional benchmarks, including ARMA with McClear-generated Clearsky data and quantile regression for probabilistic forecasts. ELM matches or outperforms these methods, providing accurate predictions and robust uncertainty quantification. This approach offers a simple, efficient solution for real-time solar forecasting. By overcoming the stationarization process limitations based on usual multiplicative scheme Clearsky models, it provides a flexible and reliable framework for modern energy systems.</description>

      <title>The day-ahead scenario generation method for new energy based on an improved conditional generative diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the rising share of new energy generation, accurately generating new energy output scenarios is crucial for day-ahead power system scheduling. Deep learning-based scenario generation methods can address this need, but their black-box nature raises concerns about interpretability. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces a method for day-ahead new energy scenario generation based on an improved conditional generative diffusion model. This method is built on the theoretical framework of Markov chains and variational inference. It first transforms historical data into pure noise through a diffusion process, then uses conditional information to guide the denoising process, ultimately generating scenarios that satisfy the conditional distribution. Additionally, the noise table is improved to a cosine form, enhancing the quality of the generated scenarios. When applied to actual wind and solar output data, the results demonstrate that this method effectively generates new energy output scenarios with good adaptability.</description>

      <title>TS-RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation based Time Series Foundation Models are Stronger Zero-Shot Forecaster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models (FMs) have become prevalent for time series forecasting tasks. However, fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for forecasting enables the adaptation to specific domains but may not generalize well across diverse, unseen datasets. Meanwhile, existing time series foundation models (TSFMs) lack inherent mechanisms for domain adaptation and suffer from limited interpretability, making them suboptimal for zero-shot forecasting. To this end, we present TS-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation based time series forecasting framework that enhances the generalization capability and interpretability of TSFMs. Specifically, TS-RAG leverages pre-trained time series encoders to retrieve semantically relevant time series segments from a dedicated knowledge database, incorporating contextual patterns for the given time series query. Next, we develop a learnable Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based augmentation module, which dynamically fuses retrieved time series patterns with the TSFM's representation of the input query, improving forecasting accuracy without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Thorough empirical studies on seven public benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance, outperforming TSFMs by up to 6.51% across diverse domains and showcasing desired interpretability.</description>

      <title>Insights into Schizophrenia: Leveraging Machine Learning for Early Identification via EEG, ERP, and Demographic Attributes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research presents a machine learning (ML) classifier designed to differentiate between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls by utilising features extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG) data, specifically focusing on event-related potentials (ERPs) and certain demographic variables. The dataset comprises data from 81 participants, encompassing 32 healthy controls and 49 schizophrenia patients, all sourced from an online dataset. After preprocessing the dataset, our ML model achieved an accuracy of 99.980%. This performance outperforms earlier research, including those that used deep learning methods. Additionally, an analysis was conducted to assess individual features' contribution to improving classification accuracy. This involved systematically excluding specific features from the original dataset one at a time, and another technique involved an iterative process of removing features based on their entropy scores incrementally. The impact of these removals on model performance was evaluated to identify the most informative features.</description>

      <title>Early Detection of Mental Health Issues Using Social Media Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of mental health disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder, calls for immediate need in developing tools for early detection and intervention. Social media platforms, like Reddit, represent a rich source of user-generated content, reflecting emotional and behavioral patterns. In this work, we propose a multi-modal deep learning framework that integrates linguistic and temporal features for early detection of mental health crises. Our approach is based on the method that utilizes a BiLSTM network both for text and temporal feature analysis, modeling sequential dependencies in a different manner, capturing contextual patterns quite well. This work includes a cross-modal attention approach that allows fusion of such outputs into context-aware classification of mental health conditions. The model was then trained and evaluated on a dataset of labeled Reddit posts preprocessed using text preprocessing, scaling of temporal features, and encoding of labels. Experimental results indicate that the proposed architecture performs better compared to traditional models with a validation accuracy of 74.55% and F1-Score of 0.7376. This study presents the importance of multi-modal learning for mental health detection and provides a baseline for further improvements by using more advanced attention mechanisms and other data modalities.</description>

      <title>MergeQuant: Accurate 4-bit Static Quantization of Large Language Models by Channel-wise Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization has been widely used to compress and accelerate inference of large language models (LLMs). Existing methods focus on exploring the per-token dynamic calibration to ensure both inference acceleration and model accuracy under 4-bit quantization. However, in autoregressive generation inference of long sequences, the overhead of repeated dynamic quantization and dequantization steps becomes considerably expensive. In this work, we propose MergeQuant, an accurate and efficient per-channel static quantization framework. MergeQuant integrates the per-channel quantization steps with the corresponding scalings and linear mappings through a Quantization Step Migration (QSM) method, thereby eliminating the quantization overheads before and after matrix multiplication. Furthermore, in view of the significant differences between the different channel ranges, we propose dimensional reconstruction and adaptive clipping to address the non-uniformity of quantization scale factors and redistribute the channel variations to the subsequent modules to balance the parameter distribution under QSM. Within the static quantization setting of W4A4, MergeQuant reduces the accuracy gap on zero-shot tasks compared to FP16 baseline to 1.3 points on Llama-2-70B model. On Llama-2-7B model, MergeQuant achieves up to 1.77x speedup in decoding, and up to 2.06x speedup in end-to-end compared to FP16 baseline.</description>

      <title>GraphT5: Unified Molecular Graph-Language Modeling via Multi-Modal Cross-Token Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular language modeling tasks such as molecule captioning have been recognized for their potential to further understand molecular properties that can aid drug discovery or material synthesis based on chemical reactions. Unlike the common use of molecule graphs in predicting molecular properties, most methods in molecular language modeling rely heavily on SMILES sequences. This preference is because the task involves generating a sequence of multiple tokens using transformer-based models. Therefore, a main challenge is determining how to integrate graph data, which contains structural and spatial information about molecules, with text data. In addition, simply using both 1D SMILES text and 2D graph as inputs without addressing how they align and represent the molecule structure in different modalities makes it challenging to fully utilize structural knowledge about molecules. To this end, we propose GraphT5, a multi-modal framework that integrates 1D SMILES text and 2D graph representations of molecules for molecular language modeling. Specifically, we introduce a novel cross-token attention module in GraphT5 to bridge the gap arising from the fundamental differences between the two modalities of molecule representations. Cross-token attention exploits implicit information between SMILES and graphs of molecules, resulting from their interactions at a fine-grained token level that benefits molecular language modeling. Extensive experiments including molecule captioning, IUPAC name prediction tasks, and case studies show that our GraphT5 outperforms the latest baseline approaches, which validates the effectiveness of our GraphT5 in sufficiently utilizing 1D SMILES text and 2D graph representations.</description>

      <title>DriveTransformer: Unified Transformer for Scalable End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a trend in the field of autonomous driving, promising a data-driven, scalable approach to system design. However, existing E2E-AD methods usually adopt the sequential paradigm of perception-prediction-planning, which leads to cumulative errors and training instability. The manual ordering of tasks also limits the system`s ability to leverage synergies between tasks (for example, planning-aware perception and game-theoretic interactive prediction and planning). Moreover, the dense BEV representation adopted by existing methods brings computational challenges for long-range perception and long-term temporal fusion. To address these challenges, we present DriveTransformer, a simplified E2E-AD framework for the ease of scaling up, characterized by three key features: Task Parallelism (All agent, map, and planning queries direct interact with each other at each block), Sparse Representation (Task queries direct interact with raw sensor features), and Streaming Processing (Task queries are stored and passed as history information). As a result, the new framework is composed of three unified operations: task self-attention, sensor cross-attention, temporal cross-attention, which significantly reduces the complexity of system and leads to better training stability. DriveTransformer achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulated closed-loop benchmark Bench2Drive and real world open-loop benchmark nuScenes with high FPS.</description>

      <title>SplitQuantV2: Enhancing Low-Bit Quantization of LLMs Without GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantization of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for deploying them on devices with limited computational resources. While advanced quantization algorithms offer improved performance compared to the basic linear quantization, they typically require high-end graphics processing units (GPUs), are often restricted to specific deep neural network (DNN) frameworks, and require calibration datasets. This limitation poses challenges for using such algorithms on various neural processing units (NPUs) and edge AI devices, which have diverse model formats and frameworks. In this paper, we show SplitQuantV2, an innovative algorithm designed to enhance low-bit linear quantization of LLMs, can achieve results comparable to those of advanced algorithms. SplitQuantV2 preprocesses models by splitting linear and convolution layers into functionally equivalent, quantization-friendly structures. The algorithm's platform-agnostic, concise, and efficient nature allows for implementation without the need for GPUs. Our evaluation on the Llama 3.2 1B Instruct model using the AI2's Reasoning Challenge (ARC) dataset demonstrates that SplitQuantV2 improves the accuracy of the INT4 quantization model by 11.76%p, matching the performance of the original floating-point model. Remarkably, SplitQuantV2 took only 2 minutes 6 seconds to preprocess the 1B model and perform linear INT4 quantization using only an Apple M4 CPU. SplitQuantV2 provides a practical solution for low-bit quantization on LLMs, especially when complex, computation-intensive algorithms are inaccessible due to hardware limitations or framework incompatibilities.</description>

      <title>Disrupting Model Merging: A Parameter-Level Defense Without Sacrificing Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model merging is a technique that combines multiple finetuned models into a single model without additional training, allowing a free-rider to cheaply inherit specialized capabilities. This study investigates methodologies to suppress unwanted model merging by free-riders. Existing methods such as model watermarking or fingerprinting can only detect merging in hindsight. In contrast, we propose a first proactive defense against model merging. Specifically, our defense method modifies the model parameters so that the model is disrupted if the model is merged with any other model, while its functionality is kept unchanged if not merged with others. Our approach consists of two modules, rearranging MLP parameters and scaling attention heads, which push the model out of the shared basin in parameter space, causing the merging performance with other models to degrade significantly. We conduct extensive experiments on image classification, image generation, and text classification to demonstrate that our defense severely disrupts merging while retaining the functionality of the post-protect model. Moreover, we analyze potential adaptive attacks and further propose a dropout-based pruning to improve our proposal's robustness.</description>

      <title>Merge then Realign: Simple and Effective Modality-Incremental Continual Learning for Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enhanced their versatility as they integrate a growing number of modalities. Considering the heavy cost of training MLLMs, it is necessary to reuse the existing ones and further extend them to more modalities through Modality-incremental Continual Learning (MCL). However, this often comes with a performance degradation in the previously learned modalities. In this work, we revisit the MCL and investigate a more severe issue it faces in contrast to traditional continual learning, that its degradation comes not only from catastrophic forgetting but also from the misalignment between the modality-agnostic and modality-specific components. To address this problem, we propose an elegantly simple MCL paradigm called "MErge then ReAlign" (MERA). Our method avoids introducing heavy training overhead or modifying the model architecture, hence is easy to deploy and highly reusable in the MLLM community. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, despite the simplicity of MERA, it shows impressive performance, holding up to a 99.84% Backward Relative Gain when extending to four modalities, achieving a nearly lossless MCL performance.</description>

      <title>Data Foundations for Large Scale Multimodal Clinical Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in clinical AI have enabled remarkable progress across many clinical domains. However, existing benchmarks and models are primarily limited to a small set of modalities and tasks, which hinders the development of large-scale multimodal methods that can make holistic assessments of patient health and well-being. To bridge this gap, we introduce Clinical Large-Scale Integrative Multimodal Benchmark (CLIMB), a comprehensive clinical benchmark unifying diverse clinical data across imaging, language, temporal, and graph modalities. CLIMB comprises 4.51 million patient samples totaling 19.01 terabytes distributed across 2D imaging, 3D video, time series, graphs, and multimodal data. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that multitask pretraining significantly improves performance on understudied domains, achieving up to 29% improvement in ultrasound and 23% in ECG analysis over single-task learning. Pretraining on CLIMB also effectively improves models' generalization capability to new tasks, and strong unimodal encoder performance translates well to multimodal performance when paired with task-appropriate fusion strategies. Our findings provide a foundation for new architecture designs and pretraining strategies to advance clinical AI research. Code is released at https://github.com/DDVD233/climb.</description>

      <title>WECAR: An End-Edge Collaborative Inference and Training Framework for WiFi-Based Continuous Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WiFi-based human activity recognition (HAR) holds significant promise for ubiquitous sensing in smart environments. A critical challenge lies in enabling systems to dynamically adapt to evolving scenarios, learning new activities without catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge, while adhering to the stringent computational constraints of edge devices. Current approaches struggle to reconcile these requirements due to prohibitive storage demands for retaining historical data and inefficient parameter utilization. We propose WECAR, an end-edge collaborative inference and training framework for WiFi-based continuous HAR, which decouples computational workloads to overcome these limitations. In this framework, edge devices handle model training, lightweight optimization, and updates, while end devices perform efficient inference. WECAR introduces two key innovations, i.e., dynamic continual learning with parameter efficiency and hierarchical distillation for end deployment. For the former, we propose a transformer-based architecture enhanced by task-specific dynamic model expansion and stability-aware selective retraining. For the latter, we propose a dual-phase distillation mechanism that includes multi-head self-attention relation distillation and prefix relation distillation. We implement WECAR based on heterogeneous hardware using Jetson Nano as edge devices and the ESP32 as end devices, respectively. Our experiments across three public WiFi datasets reveal that WECAR not only outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in performance and parameter efficiency, but also achieves a substantial reduction in the model's parameter count post-optimization without sacrificing accuracy. This validates its practicality for resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>TVNet: A Novel Time Series Analysis Method Based on Dynamic Convolution and 3D-Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the recent development and advancement of Transformer and MLP architectures, significant strides have been made in time series analysis. Conversely, the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in time series analysis has fallen short of expectations, diminishing their potential for future applications. Our research aims to enhance the representational capacity of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in time series analysis by introducing novel perspectives and design innovations. To be specific, We introduce a novel time series reshaping technique that considers the inter-patch, intra-patch, and cross-variable dimensions. Consequently, we propose TVNet, a dynamic convolutional network leveraging a 3D perspective to employ time series analysis. TVNet retains the computational efficiency of CNNs and achieves state-of-the-art results in five key time series analysis tasks, offering a superior balance of efficiency and performance over the state-of-the-art Transformer-based and MLP-based models. Additionally, our findings suggest that TVNet exhibits enhanced transferability and robustness. Therefore, it provides a new perspective for applying CNN in advanced time series analysis tasks.</description>

      <title>PLADIS: Pushing the Limits of Attention in Diffusion Models at Inference Time by Leveraging Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown impressive results in generating high-quality conditional samples using guidance techniques such as Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, existing methods often require additional training or neural function evaluations (NFEs), making them incompatible with guidance-distilled models. Also, they rely on heuristic approaches that need identifying target layers. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient method, termed PLADIS, which boosts pre-trained models (U-Net/Transformer) by leveraging sparse attention. Specifically, we extrapolate query-key correlations using softmax and its sparse counterpart in the cross-attention layer during inference, without requiring extra training or NFEs. By leveraging the noise robustness of sparse attention, our PLADIS unleashes the latent potential of text-to-image diffusion models, enabling them to excel in areas where they once struggled with newfound effectiveness. It integrates seamlessly with guidance techniques, including guidance-distilled models. Extensive experiments show notable improvements in text alignment and human preference, offering a highly efficient and universally applicable solution.</description>

      <title>Using a single actor to output personalized policy for different intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, with the development of Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) has achieved satisfactory results. In traffic scenarios with multiple intersections, MARL treats each intersection as an agent and optimizes traffic signal control strategies through learning and real-time decision-making. Considering that observation distributions of intersections might be different in real-world scenarios, shared parameter methods might lack diversity and thus lead to high generalization requirements in the shared-policy network. A typical solution is to increase the size of network parameters. However, simply increasing the scale of the network does not necessarily improve policy generalization, which is validated in our experiments. Accordingly, an approach that considers both the personalization of intersections and the efficiency of parameter sharing is required. To this end, we propose Hyper-Action Multi-Head Proximal Policy Optimization (HAMH-PPO), a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) MARL method that utilizes a shared PPO policy network to deliver personalized policies for intersections with non-iid observation distributions. The centralized critic in HAMH-PPO uses graph attention units to calculate the graph representations of all intersections and outputs a set of value estimates with multiple output heads for each intersection. The decentralized execution actor takes the local observation history as input and output distributions of action as well as a so-called hyper-action to balance the multiple values estimated from the centralized critic to further guide the updating of TSC policies. The combination of hyper-action and multi-head values enables multiple agents to share a single actor-critic while achieving personalized policies.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Balance Packing: Towards Efficient Supervised Fine-tuning for Long-Context LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training Long-Context Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging, as hybrid training with long-context and short-context data often leads to workload imbalances. Existing works mainly use data packing to alleviate this issue but fail to consider imbalanced attention computation and wasted communication overhead. This paper proposes Hierarchical Balance Packing (HBP), which designs a novel batch-construction method and training recipe to address those inefficiencies. In particular, the HBP constructs multi-level data packing groups, each optimized with a distinct packing length. It assigns training samples to their optimal groups and configures each group with the most effective settings, including sequential parallelism degree and gradient checkpointing configuration. To effectively utilize multi-level groups of data, we design a dynamic training pipeline specifically tailored to HBP, including curriculum learning, adaptive sequential parallelism, and stable loss. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training time over multiple datasets and open-source models while maintaining strong performance. For the largest DeepSeek-V2 (236B) MOE model, our method speeds up the training by 2.4$\times$ with competitive performance.</description>

      <title>Transforming Traditional Neural Networks into Neuromorphic Quantum-Cognitive Models: A Tutorial with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technologies are increasingly pervasive, underpinning the operation of numerous electronic, optical and medical devices. Today, we are also witnessing rapid advancements in quantum computing and communication. However, access to quantum technologies in computation remains largely limited to professionals in research organisations and high-tech industries. This paper demonstrates how traditional neural networks can be transformed into neuromorphic quantum models, enabling anyone with a basic understanding of undergraduate-level machine learning to create quantum-inspired models that mimic the functioning of the human brain -- all using a standard laptop. We present several examples of these quantum machine learning transformations and explore their potential applications, aiming to make quantum technology more accessible and practical for broader use. The examples discussed in this paper include quantum-inspired analogues of feedforward neural networks, recurrent neural networks, Echo State Network reservoir computing and Bayesian neural networks, demonstrating that a quantum approach can both optimise the training process and equip the models with certain human-like cognitive characteristics.</description>

      <title>A Time Series Multitask Framework Integrating a Large Language Model, Pre-Trained Time Series Model, and Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series analysis is crucial in fields like finance, transportation, and industry. However, traditional models often focus solely on temporal features, limiting their ability to capture underlying information. This paper proposes a novel time series multitask framework, called LTM, which integrates temporal features with textual descriptions to enhance analytical and predictive capabilities. LTM combines pre-trained time series model, large language model (LLM), and knowledge graph to tackle time series tasks, including forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection. LTM achieves improved performance with a few trainable parameters. It is very efficient and practical. LTM encodes time series data into patches and enriches user-provided prompts using knowledge graphs to generate enhanced prompts. A novel feature fusion method embeds prompts into each patch encoding, which is processed by a frozen LLM, followed by a feature enhancement module and a time decoder module. During fine-tuning stage, cosine similarity between prompts and temporal patches is integrated into the loss function to boost performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that LTM significantly outperforms existing methods. It provides a robust and versatile solution for time series tasks.</description>

      <title>Log Optimization Simplification Method for Predicting Remaining Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information systems generate a large volume of event log data during business operations, much of which consists of low-value and redundant information. When performance predictions are made directly from these logs, the accuracy of the predictions can be compromised. Researchers have explored methods to simplify and compress these data while preserving their valuable components. Most existing approaches focus on reducing the dimensionality of the data by eliminating redundant and irrelevant features. However, there has been limited investigation into the efficiency of execution both before and after event log simplification. In this paper, we present a prediction point selection algorithm designed to avoid the simplification of all points that function similarly. We select sequences or self-loop structures to form a simplifiable segment, and we optimize the deviation between the actual simplifiable value and the original data prediction value to prevent over-simplification. Experiments indicate that the simplified event log retains its predictive performance and, in some cases, enhances its predictive accuracy compared to the original event log.</description>

      <title>Fair Text Classification via Transferable Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group fairness is a central research topic in text classification, where reaching fair treatment between sensitive groups (e.g., women and men) remains an open challenge. We propose an approach that extends the use of the Wasserstein Dependency Measure for learning unbiased neural text classifiers. Given the challenge of distinguishing fair from unfair information in a text encoder, we draw inspiration from adversarial training by inducing independence between representations learned for the target label and those for a sensitive attribute. We further show that Domain Adaptation can be efficiently leveraged to remove the need for access to the sensitive attributes in the dataset we cure. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence that our approach is well-founded.</description>

      <title>PoisonedParrot: Subtle Data Poisoning Attacks to Elicit Copyright-Infringing Content from Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to expand, their usage has become increasingly prevalent. However, as reflected in numerous ongoing lawsuits regarding LLM-generated content, addressing copyright infringement remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce PoisonedParrot: the first stealthy data poisoning attack that induces an LLM to generate copyrighted content even when the model has not been directly trained on the specific copyrighted material. PoisonedParrot integrates small fragments of copyrighted text into the poison samples using an off-the-shelf LLM. Despite its simplicity, evaluated in a wide range of experiments, PoisonedParrot is surprisingly effective at priming the model to generate copyrighted content with no discernible side effects. Moreover, we discover that existing defenses are largely ineffective against our attack. Finally, we make the first attempt at mitigating copyright-infringement poisoning attacks by proposing a defense: ParrotTrap. We encourage the community to explore this emerging threat model further.</description>

Abstract: With the exponential growth of time series data across diverse domains, there is a pressing need for effective analysis tools. Time series clustering is important for identifying patterns in these datasets. However, prevailing methods often encounter obstacles in maintaining data relationships and ensuring interpretability.

      <title>RayFlow: Instance-Aware Diffusion Acceleration via Adaptive Flow Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success across various domains. However, their slow generation speed remains a critical challenge. Existing acceleration methods, while aiming to reduce steps, often compromise sample quality, controllability, or introduce training complexities. Therefore, we propose RayFlow, a novel diffusion framework that addresses these limitations. Unlike previous methods, RayFlow guides each sample along a unique path towards an instance-specific target distribution. This method minimizes sampling steps while preserving generation diversity and stability. Furthermore, we introduce Time Sampler, an importance sampling technique to enhance training efficiency by focusing on crucial timesteps. Extensive experiments demonstrate RayFlow's superiority in generating high-quality images with improved speed, control, and training efficiency compared to existing acceleration techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guaranteeing constraint satisfaction is challenging in imitation learning (IL), particularly in tasks that require operating near a system's handling limits. Traditional IL methods often struggle to enforce constraints, leading to suboptimal performance in high-precision tasks. In this paper, we present a simple approach to incorporating safety into the IL objective. Through simulations, we empirically validate our approach on an autonomous racing task with both full-state and image feedback, demonstrating improved constraint satisfaction and greater consistency in task performance compared to a baseline method.</description>

      <title>Evaluating LLaMA 3.2 for Software Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful tool for vulnerability detection, often outperforming traditional solutions. However, developing effective DL models requires large amounts of real-world data, which can be difficult to obtain in sufficient quantities. To address this challenge, DiverseVul dataset has been curated as the largest dataset of vulnerable and non-vulnerable C/C++ functions extracted exclusively from real-world projects. Its goal is to provide high-quality, large-scale samples for training DL models. However, during our study several inconsistencies were identified in the raw dataset while applying pre-processing techniques, highlighting the need for a refined version. In this work, we present a refined version of DiverseVul dataset, which is used to fine-tune a large language model, LLaMA 3.2, for vulnerability detection. Experimental results show that the use of pre-processing techniques led to an improvement in performance, with the model achieving an F1-Score of 66%, a competitive result when compared to our baseline, which achieved a 47% F1-Score in software vulnerability detection.</description>

      <title>Sublinear Algorithms for Wasserstein and Total Variation Distances: Applications to Fairness and Privacy Auditing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resource-efficiently computing representations of probability distributions and the distances between them while only having access to the samples is a fundamental and useful problem across mathematical sciences. In this paper, we propose a generic algorithmic framework to estimate the PDF and CDF of any sub-Gaussian distribution while the samples from them arrive in a stream. We compute mergeable summaries of distributions from the stream of samples that require sublinear space w.r.t. the number of observed samples. This allows us to estimate Wasserstein and Total Variation (TV) distances between any two sub-Gaussian distributions while samples arrive in streams and from multiple sources (e.g. federated learning). Our algorithms significantly improves on the existing methods for distance estimation incurring super-linear time and linear space complexities. In addition, we use the proposed estimators of Wasserstein and TV distances to audit the fairness and privacy of the ML algorithms. We empirically demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithms for estimating these distances and auditing using both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Joint Explainability-Performance Optimization With Surrogate Models for AI-Driven Edge Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable AI is a crucial component for edge services, as it ensures reliable decision making based on complex AI models. Surrogate models are a prominent approach of XAI where human-interpretable models, such as a linear regression model, are trained to approximate a complex (black-box) model's predictions. This paper delves into the balance between the predictive accuracy of complex AI models and their approximation by surrogate ones, advocating that both these models benefit from being learned simultaneously. We derive a joint (bi-level) training scheme for both models and we introduce a new algorithm based on multi-objective optimization (MOO) to simultaneously minimize both the complex model's prediction error and the error between its outputs and those of the surrogate. Our approach leads to improvements that exceed 99% in the approximation of the black-box model through the surrogate one, as measured by the metric of Fidelity, for a compromise of less than 3% absolute reduction in the black-box model's predictive accuracy, compared to single-task and multi-task learning baselines. By improving Fidelity, we can derive more trustworthy explanations of the complex model's outcomes from the surrogate, enabling reliable AI applications for intelligent services at the network edge.</description>

      <title>Group Fairness in Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a critical societal consideration in the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL): ensuring equitable outcomes across different demographic groups in multi-task settings. While previous work has explored fairness in single-task RL, many real-world applications are multi-task in nature and require policies to maintain fairness across all tasks. We introduce a novel formulation of multi-task group fairness in RL and propose a constrained optimization algorithm that explicitly enforces fairness constraints across multiple tasks simultaneously. We have shown that our proposed algorithm does not violate fairness constraints with high probability and with sublinear regret in the finite-horizon episodic setting. Through experiments in RiverSwim and MuJoCo environments, we demonstrate that our approach better ensures group fairness across multiple tasks compared to previous methods that lack explicit multi-task fairness constraints in both the finite-horizon setting and the infinite-horizon setting. Our results show that the proposed algorithm achieves smaller fairness gaps while maintaining comparable returns across different demographic groups and tasks, suggesting its potential for addressing fairness concerns in real-world multi-task RL applications.</description>

      <title>Strengthening the Internal Adversarial Robustness in Lifted Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lifted neural networks (i.e. neural architectures explicitly optimizing over respective network potentials to determine the neural activities) can be combined with a type of adversarial training to gain robustness for internal as well as input layers, in addition to improved generalization performance. In this work we first investigate how adversarial robustness in this framework can be further strengthened by solely modifying the training loss. In a second step we fix some remaining limitations and arrive at a novel training loss for lifted neural networks, that combines targeted and untargeted adversarial perturbations.</description>

      <title>TwinTURBO: Semi-Supervised Fine-Tuning of Foundation Models via Mutual Information Decompositions for Downstream Task and Latent Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a semi-supervised fine-tuning framework for foundation models that utilises mutual information decomposition to address the challenges of training for a limited amount of labelled data. Our approach derives two distinct lower bounds: i) for the downstream task space, such as classification, optimised using conditional and marginal cross-entropy alongside Kullback-Leibler divergence, and ii) for the latent space representation, regularised and aligned using a contrastive-like decomposition. This fine-tuning strategy retains the pre-trained structure of the foundation model, modifying only a specialised projector module comprising a small transformer and a token aggregation technique. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate significant improvements in classification tasks under extremely low-labelled conditions by effectively leveraging unlabelled data.</description>

      <title>CIMAGE: Exploiting the Conditional Independence in Masked Graph Auto-encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods encapsulating relational information via masking in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising performance. However, most existing approaches rely on random masking strategies in either feature or graph space, which may fail to capture task-relevant information fully. We posit that this limitation stems from an inability to achieve minimum redundancy between masked and unmasked components while ensuring maximum relevance of both to potential downstream tasks. Conditional Independence (CI) inherently satisfies the minimum redundancy and maximum relevance criteria, but its application typically requires access to downstream labels. To address this challenge, we introduce CIMAGE, a novel approach that leverages Conditional Independence to guide an effective masking strategy within the latent space. CIMAGE utilizes CI-aware latent factor decomposition to generate two distinct contexts, leveraging high-confidence pseudo-labels derived from unsupervised graph clustering. In this framework, the pretext task involves reconstructing the masked second context solely from the information provided by the first context. Our theoretical analysis further supports the superiority of CIMAGE's novel CI-aware masking method by demonstrating that the learned embedding exhibits approximate linear separability, which enables accurate predictions for the downstream task. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse graph benchmarks illustrate the advantage of CIMAGE, with notably higher average rankings on node classification and link prediction tasks. Notably, our proposed model highlights the under-explored potential of CI in enhancing graph SSL methodologies and offers enriched insights for effective graph representation learning.</description>

      <title>Right Reward Right Time for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical learning periods (CLPs) in federated learning (FL) refer to early stages during which low-quality contributions (e.g., sparse training data availability) can permanently impair the learning performance of the global model owned by the model owner (i.e., the cloud server). However, strategies to motivate clients with high-quality contributions to join the FL training process and share trained model updates during CLPs remain underexplored. Additionally, existing incentive mechanisms in FL treat all training periods equally, which consequently fails to motivate clients to participate early. Compounding this challenge is the cloud's limited knowledge of client training capabilities due to privacy regulations, leading to information asymmetry. Therefore, in this article, we propose a time-aware incentive mechanism, called Right Reward Right Time (R3T), to encourage client involvement, especially during CLPs, to maximize the utility of the cloud in FL. Specifically, the cloud utility function captures the trade-off between the achieved model performance and payments allocated for clients' contributions, while accounting for clients' time and system capabilities, efforts, joining time, and rewards. Then, we analytically derive the optimal contract for the cloud and devise a CLP-aware mechanism to incentivize early participation and efforts while maximizing cloud utility, even under information asymmetry. By providing the right reward at the right time, our approach can attract the highest-quality contributions during CLPs. Simulation and proof-of-concept studies show that R3T increases cloud utility and is more economically effective than benchmarks. Notably, our proof-of-concept results show up to a 47.6% reduction in the total number of clients and up to a 300% improvement in convergence time while reaching competitive test accuracies compared with incentive mechanism benchmarks.</description>

      <title>ReLATE: Resilient Learner Selection for Multivariate Time-Series Classification Against Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimizing computational overhead in time-series classification, particularly in deep learning models, presents a significant challenge. This challenge is further compounded by adversarial attacks, emphasizing the need for resilient methods that ensure robust performance and efficient model selection. We introduce ReLATE, a framework that identifies robust learners based on dataset similarity, reduces computational overhead, and enhances resilience. ReLATE maintains multiple deep learning models in well-known adversarial attack scenarios, capturing model performance. ReLATE identifies the most analogous dataset to a given target using a similarity metric, then applies the optimal model from the most similar dataset. ReLATE reduces computational overhead by an average of 81.2%, enhancing adversarial resilience and streamlining robust model selection, all without sacrificing performance, within 4.2% of Oracle.</description>

      <title>Cross-platform Prediction of Depression Treatment Outcome Using Location Sensory Data on Smartphones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, depression treatment relies on closely monitoring patients response to treatment and adjusting the treatment as needed. Using self-reported or physician-administrated questionnaires to monitor treatment response is, however, burdensome, costly and suffers from recall bias. In this paper, we explore using location sensory data collected passively on smartphones to predict treatment outcome. To address heterogeneous data collection on Android and iOS phones, the two predominant smartphone platforms, we explore using domain adaptation techniques to map their data to a common feature space, and then use the data jointly to train machine learning models. Our results show that this domain adaptation approach can lead to significantly better prediction than that with no domain adaptation. In addition, our results show that using location features and baseline self-reported questionnaire score can lead to F1 score up to 0.67, comparable to that obtained using periodic self-reported questionnaires, indicating that using location data is a promising direction for predicting depression treatment outcome.</description>

      <title>Hyperoctant Search Clustering: A Method for Clustering Data in High-Dimensional Hyperspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering of high-dimensional data sets is a growing need in artificial intelligence, machine learning and pattern recognition. In this paper, we propose a new clustering method based on a combinatorial-topological approach applied to regions of space defined by signs of coordinates (hyperoctants). In high-dimensional spaces, this approach often reduces the size of the dataset while preserving sufficient topological features. According to a density criterion, the method builds clusters of data points based on the partitioning of a graph, whose vertices represent hyperoctants, and whose edges connect neighboring hyperoctants under the Levenshtein distance. We call this method HyperOctant Search Clustering. We prove some mathematical properties of the method. In order to as assess its performance, we choose the application of topic detection, which is an important task in text mining. Our results suggest that our method is more stable under variations of the main hyperparameter, and remarkably, it is not only a clustering method, but also a tool to explore the dataset from a topological perspective, as it directly provides information about the number of hyperoctants where there are data points. We also discuss the possible connections between our clustering method and other research fields.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Explanations for Model Ensembles Using Entropic Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations indicate the smallest change in input that can translate to a different outcome for a machine learning model. Counterfactuals have generated immense interest in high-stakes applications such as finance, education, hiring, etc. In several use-cases, the decision-making process often relies on an ensemble of models rather than just one. Despite significant research on counterfactuals for one model, the problem of generating a single counterfactual explanation for an ensemble of models has received limited interest. Each individual model might lead to a different counterfactual, whereas trying to find a counterfactual accepted by all models might significantly increase cost (effort). We propose a novel strategy to find the counterfactual for an ensemble of models using the perspective of entropic risk measure. Entropic risk is a convex risk measure that satisfies several desirable properties. We incorporate our proposed risk measure into a novel constrained optimization to generate counterfactuals for ensembles that stay valid for several models. The main significance of our measure is that it provides a knob that allows for the generation of counterfactuals that stay valid under an adjustable fraction of the models. We also show that a limiting case of our entropic-risk-based strategy yields a counterfactual valid for all models in the ensemble (worst-case min-max approach). We study the trade-off between the cost (effort) for the counterfactual and its validity for an ensemble by varying degrees of risk aversion, as determined by our risk parameter knob. We validate our performance on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>CAD-VAE: Leveraging Correlation-Aware Latents for Comprehensive Fair Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While deep generative models have significantly advanced representation learning, they may inherit or amplify biases and fairness issues by encoding sensitive attributes alongside predictive features. Enforcing strict independence in disentanglement is often unrealistic when target and sensitive factors are naturally correlated. To address this challenge, we propose CAD-VAE (Correlation-Aware Disentangled VAE), which introduces a correlated latent code to capture the shared information between target and sensitive attributes. Given this correlated latent, our method effectively separates overlapping factors without extra domain knowledge by directly minimizing the conditional mutual information between target and sensitive codes. A relevance-driven optimization strategy refines the correlated code by efficiently capturing essential correlated features and eliminating redundancy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CAD-VAE produces fairer representations, realistic counterfactuals, and improved fairness-aware image editing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing interest in hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) is driven by their capacity to capture the complex relationships and patterns within hypergraph structured data across various domains, including computer vision, complex networks, and natural language processing. This paper comprehensively reviews recent advances in HGNNs and presents a taxonomy of mainstream models based on their architectures: hypergraph convolutional networks (HGCNs), hypergraph attention networks (HGATs), hypergraph autoencoders (HGAEs), hypergraph recurrent networks (HGRNs), and deep hypergraph generative models (DHGGMs). For each category, we delve into its practical applications, mathematical mechanisms, literature contributions, and open problems. Finally, we discuss some common challenges and promising research directions.This paper aspires to be a helpful resource that provides guidance for future research and applications of HGNNs.</description>

      <title>Overlap-aware meta-learning attention to enhance hypergraph neural networks for node classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for analyzing complex datasets, their practical performance often remains limited. On one hand, existing networks typically employ a single type of attention mechanism, focusing on either structural or feature similarities during message passing. On the other hand, assuming that all nodes in current hypergraph models have the same level of overlap may lead to suboptimal generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework, overlap-aware meta-learning attention for hypergraph neural networks (OMA-HGNN). First, we introduce a hypergraph attention mechanism that integrates both structural and feature similarities. Specifically, we linearly combine their respective losses with weighted factors for the HGNN model. Second, we partition nodes into different tasks based on their diverse overlap levels and develop a multi-task Meta-Weight-Net (MWN) to determine the corresponding weighted factors. Third, we jointly train the internal MWN model with the losses from the external HGNN model and train the external model with the weighted factors from the internal model. To evaluate the effectiveness of OMA-HGNN, we conducted experiments on six real-world datasets and benchmarked its perfor-mance against nine state-of-the-art methods for node classification. The results demonstrate that OMA-HGNN excels in learning superior node representations and outperforms these baselines.</description>

      <title>Detecting Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning via Direction Alignment Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distributed nature of training makes Federated Learning (FL) vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where malicious model updates aim to compromise the global model's performance on specific tasks. Existing defense methods show limited efficacy as they overlook the inconsistency between benign and malicious model updates regarding both general and fine-grained directions. To fill this gap, we introduce AlignIns, a novel defense method designed to safeguard FL systems against backdoor attacks. AlignIns looks into the direction of each model update through a direction alignment inspection process. Specifically, it examines the alignment of model updates with the overall update direction and analyzes the distribution of the signs of their significant parameters, comparing them with the principle sign across all model updates. Model updates that exhibit an unusual degree of alignment are considered malicious and thus be filtered out. We provide the theoretical analysis of the robustness of AlignIns and its propagation error in FL. Our empirical results on both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID datasets demonstrate that AlignIns achieves higher robustness compared to the state-of-the-art defense methods. The code is available at https://github.com/JiiahaoXU/AlignIns.</description>

      <title>Regulatory DNA sequence Design with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cis-regulatory elements (CREs), such as promoters and enhancers, are relatively short DNA sequences that directly regulate gene expression. The fitness of CREs, measured by their ability to modulate gene expression, highly depends on the nucleotide sequences, especially specific motifs known as transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Designing high-fitness CREs is crucial for therapeutic and bioengineering applications. Current CRE design methods are limited by two major drawbacks: (1) they typically rely on iterative optimization strategies that modify existing sequences and are prone to local optima, and (2) they lack the guidance of biological prior knowledge in sequence optimization. In this paper, we address these limitations by proposing a generative approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune a pre-trained autoregressive (AR) model. Our method incorporates data-driven biological priors by deriving computational inference-based rewards that simulate the addition of activator TFBSs and removal of repressor TFBSs, which are then integrated into the RL process. We evaluate our method on promoter design tasks in two yeast media conditions and enhancer design tasks for three human cell types, demonstrating its ability to generate high-fitness CREs while maintaining sequence diversity.

      <title>Provable Zero-Shot Generalization in Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study offline reinforcement learning (RL) with zero-shot generalization property (ZSG), where the agent has access to an offline dataset including experiences from different environments, and the goal of the agent is to train a policy over the training environments which performs well on test environments without further interaction. Existing work showed that classical offline RL fails to generalize to new, unseen environments. We propose pessimistic empirical risk minimization (PERM) and pessimistic proximal policy optimization (PPPO), which leverage pessimistic policy evaluation to guide policy learning and enhance generalization. We show that both PERM and PPPO are capable of finding a near-optimal policy with ZSG. Our result serves as a first step in understanding the foundation of the generalization phenomenon in offline reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Predicting and Understanding College Student Mental Health with Interpretable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mental health issues among college students have reached critical levels, significantly impacting academic performance and overall wellbeing. Predicting and understanding mental health status among college students is challenging due to three main factors: the necessity for large-scale longitudinal datasets, the prevalence of black-box machine learning models lacking transparency, and the tendency of existing approaches to provide aggregated insights at the population level rather than individualized understanding.
  To tackle these challenges, this paper presents I-HOPE, the first Interpretable Hierarchical mOdel for Personalized mEntal health prediction. I-HOPE is a two-stage hierarchical model, validated on the College Experience Study, the longest longitudinal mobile sensing dataset. This dataset spans five years and captures data from both pre-pandemic periods and the COVID-19 pandemic. I-HOPE connects raw behavioral features to mental health status through five defined behavioral categories as interaction labels. This approach achieves a prediction accuracy of 91%, significantly surpassing the 60-70% accuracy of baseline methods. In addition, our model distills complex patterns into interpretable and individualized insights, enabling the future development of tailored interventions and improving mental health support.

Abstract: In recent years the information asymmetric Lipschitz bandits In this paper we studied the Lipschitz bandit problem applied to the multiplayer information asymmetric problem studied in \cite{chang2022online, chang2023optimal}. More specifically we consider information asymmetry in rewards, actions, or both. We adopt the CAB algorithm given in \cite{kleinberg2004nearly} which uses a fixed discretization to give regret bounds of the same order (in the dimension of the action) space in all 3 problem settings. We also adopt their zooming algorithm \cite{ kleinberg2008multi}which uses an adaptive discretization and apply it to information asymmetry in rewards and information asymmetry in actions.</description>

      <title>Injecting Imbalance Sensitivity for Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has emerged as a promising approach for deploying deep learning models in real-life applications. Recent studies have proposed optimization-based learning paradigms to establish task-shared representations in MTL. However, our paper empirically argues that these studies, specifically gradient-based ones, primarily emphasize the conflict issue while neglecting the potentially more significant impact of imbalance/dominance in MTL. In line with this perspective, we enhance the existing baseline method by injecting imbalance-sensitivity through the imposition of constraints on the projected norms. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed IMbalance-sensitive Gradient (IMGrad) descent method, we evaluate it on multiple mainstream MTL benchmarks, encompassing supervised learning tasks as well as reinforcement learning. The experimental results consistently demonstrate competitive performance.</description>

      <title>GPT-PPG: A GPT-based Foundation Model for Photoplethysmography Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel application of a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model tailored for photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, serving as a foundation model for various downstream tasks. Adapting the standard GPT architecture to suit the continuous characteristics of PPG signals, our approach demonstrates promising results. Our models are pre-trained on our extensive dataset that contains more than 200 million 30s PPG samples. We explored different supervised fine-tuning techniques to adapt our model to downstream tasks, resulting in performance comparable to or surpassing current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in tasks like atrial fibrillation detection. A standout feature of our GPT model is its inherent capability to perform generative tasks such as signal denoising effectively, without the need for further fine-tuning. This success is attributed to the generative nature of the GPT framework.</description>

      <title>Empirical Error Estimates for Graph Sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph sparsification is a well-established technique for accelerating graph-based learning algorithms, which uses edge sampling to approximate dense graphs with sparse ones. Because the sparsification error is random and unknown, users must contend with uncertainty about the reliability of downstream computations. Although it is possible for users to obtain conceptual guidance from theoretical error bounds in the literature, such results are typically impractical at a numerical level. Taking an alternative approach, we propose to address these issues from a data-driven perspective by computing empirical error estimates. The proposed error estimates are highly versatile, and we demonstrate this in four use cases: Laplacian matrix approximation, graph cut queries, graph-structured regression, and spectral clustering. Moreover, we provide two theoretical guarantees for the error estimates, and explain why the cost of computing them is manageable in comparison to the overall cost of a typical graph sparsification workflow.</description>

      <title>Generalized Kullback-Leibler Divergence Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we delve deeper into the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence loss and mathematically prove that it is equivalent to the Decoupled Kullback-Leibler (DKL) Divergence loss that consists of (1) a weighted Mean Square Error (wMSE) loss and (2) a Cross-Entropy loss incorporating soft labels. Thanks to the decoupled structure of DKL loss, we have identified two areas for improvement. Firstly, we address the limitation of KL loss in scenarios like knowledge distillation by breaking its asymmetric optimization property along with a smoother weight function. This modification effectively alleviates convergence challenges in optimization, particularly for classes with high predicted scores in soft labels. Secondly, we introduce class-wise global information into KL/DKL to reduce bias arising from individual samples. With these two enhancements, we derive the Generalized Kullback-Leibler (GKL) Divergence loss and evaluate its effectiveness by conducting experiments on CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, and vision-language datasets, focusing on adversarial training, and knowledge distillation tasks. Specifically, we achieve new state-of-the-art adversarial robustness on the public leaderboard -- RobustBench and competitive knowledge distillation performance across CIFAR/ImageNet models and CLIP models, demonstrating the substantial practical merits.

      <title>Accurate INT8 Training Through Dynamic Block-Level Fallback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer models have achieved remarkable success across various AI applications but face significant training costs. Low-bit training, such as INT8 training, can leverage computational units with higher throughput, and has already demonstrated its effectiveness on GPT2 models with block-level quantization. However, it struggles with modern Transformer variants incorporating GLU units. This is because those variants demonstrate complex distributions of activation outliers. To address the challenge, we propose Fallback Quantization, implementing mixed-precision GEMM that dynamically falls back 8-bit to 16-bit for activation blocks containing outliers. Experiments show that our approach is robustly competent in both fine-tuning and pretraining settings. Moreover, our method achieves a 1.57x end-to-end training speedup on RTX4090 GPUs.</description>

      <title>Adapting Large Language Models for Parameter-Efficient Log Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Log Anomaly Detection (LAD) seeks to identify atypical patterns in log data that are crucial to assessing the security and condition of systems. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tremendous success in various fields, the use of LLMs in enabling the detection of log anomalies is largely unexplored. This work aims to fill this gap. Due to the prohibitive costs involved in fully fine-tuning LLMs, we explore the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFTs) for adapting LLMs to LAD. To have an in-depth exploration of the potential of LLM-driven LAD, we present a comprehensive investigation of leveraging two of the most popular PEFTs -- Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) -- to tap into three prominent LLMs of varying size, including RoBERTa, GPT-2, and Llama-3, for parameter-efficient LAD. Comprehensive experiments on four public log datasets are performed to reveal important insights into effective LLM-driven LAD in several key perspectives, including the efficacy of these PEFT-based LLM-driven LAD methods, their stability, sample efficiency, robustness w.r.t. unstable logs, and cross-dataset generalization.

      <title>Symbolic Neural Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential equations are widely used to describe complex dynamical systems with evolving parameters in nature and engineering. Effectively learning a family of maps from the parameter function to the system dynamics is of great significance. In this study, we propose a novel learning framework of symbolic continuous-depth neural networks, termed Symbolic Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (SNODEs), to effectively and accurately learn the underlying dynamics of complex systems. Specifically, our learning framework comprises three stages: initially, pre-training a predefined symbolic neural network via a gradient flow matching strategy; subsequently, fine-tuning this network using Neural ODEs; and finally, constructing a general neural network to capture residuals. In this process, we apply the SNODEs framework to partial differential equation systems through Fourier analysis, achieving resolution-invariant modeling. Moreover, this framework integrates the strengths of symbolism and connectionism, boasting a universal approximation theorem while significantly enhancing interpretability and extrapolation capabilities relative to state-of-the-art baseline methods. We demonstrate this through experiments on several representative complex systems. Therefore, our framework can be further applied to a wide range of scientific problems, such as system bifurcation and control, reconstruction and forecasting, as well as the discovery of new equations.</description>

      <title>Degradation Self-Supervised Learning for Lithium-ion Battery Health Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Health evaluation for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) typically relies on constant charging/discharging protocols, often neglecting scenarios involving dynamic current profiles prevalent in electric vehicles. Conventional health indicators for LIBs also depend on the uniformity of measured data, restricting their adaptability to non-uniform conditions. In this study, a novel training strategy for estimating LIB health based on the paradigm of self-supervised learning is proposed. A multiresolution analysis technique, empirical wavelet transform, is utilized to decompose non-stationary voltage signals in the frequency domain. This allows the removal of ineffective components for the health evaluation model. The transformer neural network serves as the model backbone, and a loss function is designed to describe the capacity degradation behavior with the assumption that the degradation in LIBs across most operating conditions is inevitable and irreversible. The results show that the model can learn the aging characteristics by analyzing sequences of voltage and current profiles obtained at various time intervals from the same LIB cell. The proposed method is successfully applied to the Stanford University LIB aging dataset, derived from electric vehicle real driving profiles. Notably, this approach achieves an average correlation coefficient of 0.9 between the evaluated health index and the degradation of actual capacity, demonstrating its efficacy in capturing LIB health degradation. This research highlights the feasibility of training deep neural networks using unlabeled LIB data, offering cost-efficient means and unleashing the potential of the measured information.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Privacy-Preserving Improved Stochastic Masking for Federated Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in federated learning (FL), the integration of generative models into FL has been limited due to challenges such as high communication costs and unstable training in heterogeneous data environments. To address these issues, we propose PRISM, a FL framework tailored for generative models that ensures (i) stable performance in heterogeneous data distributions and (ii) resource efficiency in terms of communication cost and final model size. The key of our method is to search for an optimal stochastic binary mask for a random network rather than updating the model weights, identifying a sparse subnetwork with high generative performance; i.e., a ``strong lottery ticket''. By communicating binary masks in a stochastic manner, PRISM minimizes communication overhead. This approach, combined with the utilization of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss and a mask-aware dynamic moving average aggregation method (MADA) on the server side, facilitates stable and strong generative capabilities by mitigating local divergence in FL scenarios. Moreover, thanks to its sparsifying characteristic, PRISM yields a lightweight model without extra pruning or quantization, making it ideal for environments such as edge devices. Experiments on MNIST, FMNIST, CelebA, and CIFAR10 demonstrate that PRISM outperforms existing methods, while maintaining privacy with minimal communication costs. PRISM is the first to successfully generate images under challenging non-IID and privacy-preserving FL environments on complex datasets, where previous methods have struggled.</description>

      <title>Evidential Uncertainty Probes for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate quantification of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties is essential when deploying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in high-stakes applications such as drug discovery and financial fraud detection, where reliable predictions are critical. Although Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) efficiently quantifies uncertainty using a Dirichlet distribution over predictive probabilities, existing EDL-based GNN (EGNN) models require modifications to the network architecture and retraining, failing to take advantage of pre-trained models. We propose a plug-and-play framework for uncertainty quantification in GNNs that works with pre-trained models without the need for retraining. Our Evidential Probing Network (EPN) uses a lightweight Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP) head to extract evidence from learned representations, allowing efficient integration with various GNN architectures. We further introduce evidence-based regularization techniques, referred to as EPN-reg, to enhance the estimation of epistemic uncertainty with theoretical justifications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed EPN-reg achieves state-of-the-art performance in accurate and efficient uncertainty quantification, making it suitable for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Whoever Started the Interference Should End It: Guiding Data-Free Model Merging via Task Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model merging seeks to integrate task-specific expert models into a unified architecture while preserving multi-task generalization capabilities, yet parameter interference between constituent models frequently induces performance degradation. Although prior work has explored many merging strategies, resolving interference without additional data for retraining or test-time computation remains challenging. In this paper, we theoretically demonstrate that the task vectors of the linear layer constitute an approximate linear subspace for its corresponding input. Therefore, we can minimize interference under the guidance of task vectors. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{WUDI-Merging} (\textbf{W}hoever started the interference sho\textbf{U}ld en\textbf{D} \textbf{I}t), a simple yet effective model merging method that eliminates interference without any additional data or rescaling coefficients. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across vision and language benchmarks demonstrate our method's superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance in data-free model merging scenarios (average 10.9\% improvement versus baseline methods) while even outperforming mainstream test-time adaptation approaches by 3.3\%, and only very few computing resources are required. The code will be publicly available soon.</description>

      <title>Convergence Dynamics and Stabilization Strategies of Co-Evolving Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of synthetic data in training loops has raised concerns about model collapse, where generative models degrade when trained on their own outputs. While prior work focuses on this self-consuming process, we study an underexplored yet prevalent phenomenon: co-evolving generative models that shape each other's training through iterative feedback. This is common in multimodal AI ecosystems, such as social media platforms, where text models generate captions that guide image models, and the resulting images influence the future adaptation of the text model. We take a first step by analyzing such a system, modeling the text model as a multinomial distribution and the image model as a conditional multi-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Our analysis uncovers three key results. First, when one model remains fixed, the other collapses: a frozen image model causes the text model to lose diversity, while a frozen text model leads to an exponential contraction of image diversity, though fidelity remains bounded. Second, in fully interactive systems, mutual reinforcement accelerates collapse, with image contraction amplifying text homogenization and vice versa, leading to a Matthew effect where dominant texts sustain higher image diversity while rarer texts collapse faster. Third, we analyze stabilization strategies implicitly introduced by real-world external influences. Random corpus injections for text models and user-content injections for image models prevent collapse while preserving both diversity and fidelity. Our theoretical findings are further validated through experiments.</description>

      <title>Toward Stable World Models: Measuring and Addressing World Instability in Generative Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel study on enhancing the capability of preserving the content in world models, focusing on a property we term World Stability. Recent diffusion-based generative models have advanced the synthesis of immersive and realistic environments that are pivotal for applications such as reinforcement learning and interactive game engines. However, while these models excel in quality and diversity, they often neglect the preservation of previously generated scenes over time--a shortfall that can introduce noise into agent learning and compromise performance in safety-critical settings. In this work, we introduce an evaluation framework that measures world stability by having world models perform a sequence of actions followed by their inverses to return to their initial viewpoint, thereby quantifying the consistency between the starting and ending observations. Our comprehensive assessment of state-of-the-art diffusion-based world models reveals significant challenges in achieving high world stability. Moreover, we investigate several improvement strategies to enhance world stability. Our results underscore the importance of world stability in world modeling and provide actionable insights for future research in this domain.</description>

Abstract: In multi-task Bayesian optimization, the goal is to leverage experience from optimizing existing tasks to improve the efficiency of optimizing new ones. While approaches using multi-task Gaussian processes or deep kernel transfer exist, the performance improvement is marginal when scaling to more than a moderate number of tasks. We introduce a novel approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) to learn from, and improve upon, previous optimization trajectories, scaling to approximately 2000 distinct tasks. Specifically, we propose an iterative framework in which an LLM is fine-tuned using the high quality solutions produced by BayesOpt to generate improved initializations that accelerate convergence for future optimization tasks based on previous search trajectories. We evaluate our method on two distinct domains: database query optimization and antimicrobial peptide design. Results demonstrate that our approach creates a positive feedback loop, where the LLM's generated initializations gradually improve, leading to better optimization performance. As this feedback loop continues, we find that the LLM is eventually able to generate solutions to new tasks in just a few shots that are better than the solutions produced by "from scratch" by Bayesian optimization while simultaneously requiring significantly fewer oracle calls.</description>

      <title>Scaling Probabilistic Circuits via Data Partitioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) enable us to learn joint distributions over a set of random variables and to perform various probabilistic queries in a tractable fashion. Though the tractability property allows PCs to scale beyond non-tractable models such as Bayesian Networks, scaling training and inference of PCs to larger, real-world datasets remains challenging. To remedy the situation, we show how PCs can be learned across multiple machines by recursively partitioning a distributed dataset, thereby unveiling a deep connection between PCs and federated learning (FL). This leads to federated circuits (FCs) -- a novel and flexible federated learning (FL) framework that (1) allows one to scale PCs on distributed learning environments (2) train PCs faster and (3) unifies for the first time horizontal, vertical, and hybrid FL in one framework by re-framing FL as a density estimation problem over distributed datasets. We demonstrate FC's capability to scale PCs on various large-scale datasets. Also, we show FC's versatility in handling horizontal, vertical, and hybrid FL within a unified framework on multiple classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Domain Adaptation and Entanglement: an Optimal Transport Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current machine learning systems are brittle in the face of distribution shifts (DS), where the target distribution that the system is tested on differs from the source distribution used to train the system. This problem of robustness to DS has been studied extensively in the field of domain adaptation. For deep neural networks, a popular framework for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is domain matching, in which algorithms
  try to align the marginal distributions in the feature or output space.
  The current theoretical understanding of these methods, however, is limited and existing theoretical results are not precise enough to characterize their performance in practice.
  In this paper, we derive new bounds based on optimal transport that analyze the UDA problem. Our new bounds include a term which we dub as \emph{entanglement}, consisting of an expectation of Wasserstein distance between conditionals with respect to changing data distributions. Analysis of the entanglement term provides a novel perspective on the unoptimizable aspects of UDA. In various experiments with multiple models across several DS scenarios, we show that this term can be used to explain the varying performance of UDA algorithms.</description>

      <title>Concept-Driven Deep Learning for Enhanced Protein-Specific Molecular Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning techniques have made significant strides in molecular generation for specific targets, driving advancements in drug discovery. However, existing molecular generation methods present significant limitations: those operating at the atomic level often lack synthetic feasibility, drug-likeness, and interpretability, while fragment-based approaches frequently overlook comprehensive factors that influence protein-molecule interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel fragment-based molecular generation framework tailored for specific proteins. Our method begins by constructing a protein subpocket and molecular arm concept-based neural network, which systematically integrates interaction force information and geometric complementarity to sample molecular arms for specific protein subpockets. Subsequently, we introduce a diffusion model to generate molecular backbones that connect these arms, ensuring structural integrity and chemical diversity. Our approach significantly improves synthetic feasibility and binding affinity, with a 4% increase in drug-likeness and a 6% improvement in synthetic feasibility. Furthermore, by integrating explicit interaction data through a concept-based model, our framework enhances interpretability, offering valuable insights into the molecular design process.</description>

      <title>XAI4Extremes: An interpretable machine learning framework for understanding extreme-weather precursors under climate change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change. This, in turn, is exacting a significant toll in communities worldwide. While prediction skills are increasing with advances in numerical weather prediction and artificial intelligence tools, extreme weather still present challenges. More specifically, identifying the precursors of such extreme weather events and how these precursors may evolve under climate change remain unclear. In this paper, we propose to use post-hoc interpretability methods to construct relevance weather maps that show the key extreme-weather precursors identified by deep learning models. We then compare this machine view with existing domain knowledge to understand whether deep learning models identified patterns in data that may enrich our understanding of extreme-weather precursors. We finally bin these relevant maps into different multi-year time periods to understand the role that climate change is having on these precursors. The experiments are carried out on Indochina heatwaves, but the methodology can be readily extended to other extreme weather events worldwide.</description>

      <title>Route Sparse Autoencoder to Interpret Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability of large language models (LLMs) aims to uncover the internal processes of information propagation and reasoning. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have demonstrated promise in this domain by extracting interpretable and monosemantic features. However, prior works primarily focus on feature extraction from a single layer, failing to effectively capture activations that span multiple layers. In this paper, we introduce Route Sparse Autoencoder (RouteSAE), a new framework that integrates a routing mechanism with a shared SAE to efficiently extract features from multiple layers. It dynamically assigns weights to activations from different layers, incurring minimal parameter overhead while achieving high interpretability and flexibility for targeted feature manipulation. We evaluate RouteSAE through extensive experiments on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct. Specifically, under the same sparsity constraint of 64, RouteSAE extracts 22.5% more features than baseline SAEs while achieving a 22.3% higher interpretability score. These results underscore the potential of RouteSAE as a scalable and effective method for LLM interpretability, with applications in feature discovery and model intervention. Our codes are available at https://github.com/swei2001/RouteSAEs.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Framework for Preventing Class Collapse in Supervised Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised contrastive learning (SupCL) has emerged as a prominent approach in representation learning, leveraging both supervised and self-supervised losses. However, achieving an optimal balance between these losses is challenging; failing to do so can lead to class collapse, reducing discrimination among individual embeddings in the same class. In this paper, we present theoretically grounded guidelines for SupCL to prevent class collapse in learned representations. Specifically, we introduce the Simplex-to-Simplex Embedding Model (SSEM), a theoretical framework that models various embedding structures, including all embeddings that minimize the supervised contrastive loss. Through SSEM, we analyze how hyperparameters affect learned representations, offering practical guidelines for hyperparameter selection to mitigate the risk of class collapse. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical results across synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Tangentially Aligned Integrated Gradients for User-Friendly Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated gradients is prevalent within machine learning to address the black-box problem of neural networks. The explanations given by integrated gradients depend on a choice of base-point. The choice of base-point is not a priori obvious and can lead to drastically different explanations. There is a longstanding hypothesis that data lies on a low dimensional Riemannian manifold. The quality of explanations on a manifold can be measured by the extent to which an explanation for a point lies in its tangent space. In this work, we propose that the base-point should be chosen such that it maximises the tangential alignment of the explanation. We formalise the notion of tangential alignment and provide theoretical conditions under which a base-point choice will provide explanations lying in the tangent space. We demonstrate how to approximate the optimal base-point on several well-known image classification datasets. Furthermore, we compare the optimal base-point choice with common base-points and three gradient explainability models.</description>

      <title>ExMAG: Learning of Maximally Ancestral Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one transitions from statistical to causal learning, one is seeking the most appropriate causal model. Dynamic Bayesian networks are a popular model, where a weighted directed acyclic graph represents the causal relationships. Stochastic processes are represented by its vertices, and weighted oriented edges suggest the strength of the causal relationships. When there are confounders, one would like to utilize both oriented edges (when the direction of causality is clear) and edges that are not oriented (when there is a confounder), yielding mixed graphs. A little-studied extension of acyclicity to this mixed-graph setting is known as maximally ancestral graphs. We propose a score-based learning algorithm for learning maximally ancestral graphs. A mixed-integer quadratic program is formulated, and an algorithmic approach is proposed, in which the pre-generation of exponentially many constraints is avoided by generating only violated constraints in the so-called branch-and-cut (``lazy constraint'') method. Comparing the novel approach to the state-of-the-art, we show that the proposed approach turns out to produce more accurate results when applied to small and medium-sized synthetic instances containing up to 25 variables.</description>

      <title>Dynamic DBSCAN with Euler Tour Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fast and dynamic algorithm for Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) that efficiently supports online updates. Traditional DBSCAN algorithms, designed for batch processing, become computationally expensive when applied to dynamic datasets, particularly in large-scale applications where data continuously evolves. To address this challenge, our algorithm leverages the Euler Tour Trees data structure, enabling dynamic clustering updates without the need to reprocess the entire dataset. This approach preserves a near-optimal accuracy in density estimation, as achieved by the state-of-the-art static DBSCAN method (Esfandiari et al., 2021) Our method achieves an improved time complexity of $O(d \log^3(n) + \log^4(n))$ for every data point insertion and deletion, where $n$ and $d$ denote the total number of updates and the data dimension, respectively. Empirical studies also demonstrate significant speedups over conventional DBSCANs in real-time clustering of dynamic datasets, while maintaining comparable or superior clustering quality.</description>

      <title>LangTime: A Language-Guided Unified Model for Time Series Forecasting with Proximal Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has shown an increasing interest in utilizing pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for a variety of time series applications. However, there are three main challenges when using LLMs as foundational models for time series forecasting: (1) Cross-domain generalization. (2) Cross-modality alignment. (3) Error accumulation in autoregressive frameworks. To address these challenges, we proposed LangTime, a language-guided unified model for time series forecasting that incorporates cross-domain pre-training with reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning. Specifically, LangTime constructs Temporal Comprehension Prompts (TCPs), which include dataset-wise and channel-wise instructions, to facilitate domain adaptation and condense time series into a single token, enabling LLMs to understand better and align temporal data. To improve autoregressive forecasting, we introduce TimePPO, a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning algorithm. TimePPO mitigates error accumulation by leveraging a multidimensional rewards function tailored for time series and a repeat-based value estimation strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LangTime achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain forecasting performance, while TimePPO fine-tuning effectively enhances the stability and accuracy of autoregressive forecasting.</description>

      <title>D3PO: Preference-Based Alignment of Discrete Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains, with recent advancements extending their applicability to discrete data. However, aligning discrete diffusion models with task-specific preferences remains challenging, particularly in scenarios where explicit reward functions are unavailable. In this work, we introduce Discrete Diffusion DPO (D3PO), the first adaptation of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to discrete diffusion models formulated as continuous-time Markov chains. Our approach derives a novel loss function that directly fine-tunes the generative process using preference data while preserving fidelity to a reference distribution. We validate D3PO on a structured binary sequence generation task, demonstrating that the method effectively aligns model outputs with preferences while maintaining structural validity. Our results highlight that D3PO enables controlled fine-tuning without requiring explicit reward models, making it a practical alternative to reinforcement learning-based approaches. Future research will explore extending D3PO to more complex generative tasks, including language modeling and protein sequence generation, as well as investigating alternative noise schedules, such as uniform noising, to enhance flexibility across different applications.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model as Meta-Surrogate for Data-Driven Many-Task Optimization: A Proof-of-Principle Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many-task optimization scenarios, surrogate models are valuable for mitigating the computational burden of repeated fitness evaluations across tasks. This study proposes a novel meta-surrogate framework to assist many-task optimization, by leveraging the knowledge transfer strengths and emergent capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We formulate a unified framework for many-task fitness prediction, by defining a universal model with metadata to fit a group of problems. Fitness prediction is performed on metadata and decision variables, enabling efficient knowledge sharing across tasks and adaptability to new tasks. The LLM-based meta-surrogate treats fitness prediction as conditional probability estimation, employing a unified token sequence representation for task metadata, inputs, and outputs. This approach facilitates efficient inter-task knowledge sharing through shared token embeddings and captures complex task dependencies via multi-task model training. Experimental results demonstrate the model's emergent generalization ability, including zero-shot performance on problems with unseen dimensions. When integrated into evolutionary transfer optimization (ETO), our framework supports dual-level knowledge transfer -- at both the surrogate and individual levels -- enhancing optimization efficiency and robustness. This work establishes a novel foundation for applying LLMs in surrogate modeling, offering a versatile solution for many-task optimization.</description>

      <title>ELECTRA: A Symmetry-breaking Cartesian Network for Charge Density Prediction with Floating Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Electronic Tensor Reconstruction Algorithm (ELECTRA) - an equivariant model for predicting electronic charge densities using "floating" orbitals. Floating orbitals are a long-standing idea in the quantum chemistry community that promises more compact and accurate representations by placing orbitals freely in space, as opposed to centering all orbitals at the position of atoms. Finding ideal placements of these orbitals requires extensive domain knowledge though, which thus far has prevented widespread adoption. We solve this in a data-driven manner by training a Cartesian tensor network to predict orbital positions along with orbital coefficients. This is made possible through a symmetry-breaking mechanism that is used to learn position displacements with lower symmetry than the input molecule while preserving the rotation equivariance of the charge density itself. Inspired by recent successes of Gaussian Splatting in representing densities in space, we are using Gaussians as our orbitals and predict their weights and covariance matrices. Our method achieves a state-of-the-art balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy on established benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Interpretable Reinforcement Learning by Distilling Policies into Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exist applications of reinforcement learning like medicine where policies need to be ''interpretable'' by humans. User studies have shown that some policy classes might be more interpretable than others. However, it is costly to conduct human studies of policy interpretability. Furthermore, there is no clear definition of policy interpretabiliy, i.e., no clear metrics for interpretability and thus claims depend on the chosen definition. We tackle the problem of empirically evaluating policies interpretability without humans. Despite this lack of clear definition, researchers agree on the notions of ''simulatability'': policy interpretability should relate to how humans understand policy actions given states. To advance research in interpretable reinforcement learning, we contribute a new methodology to evaluate policy interpretability. This new methodology relies on proxies for simulatability that we use to conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation of policy interpretability. We use imitation learning to compute baseline policies by distilling expert neural networks into small programs. We then show that using our methodology to evaluate the baselines interpretability leads to similar conclusions as user studies. We show that increasing interpretability does not necessarily reduce performances and can sometimes increase them. We also show that there is no policy class that better trades off interpretability and performance across tasks making it necessary for researcher to have methodologies for comparing policies interpretability.</description>

      <title>Prototype-based Heterogeneous Federated Learning for Blade Icing Detection in Wind Turbines with Class Imbalanced Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind farms, typically in high-latitude regions, face a high risk of blade icing. Traditional centralized training methods raise serious privacy concerns. To enhance data privacy in detecting wind turbine blade icing, traditional federated learning (FL) is employed. However, data heterogeneity, resulting from collections across wind farms in varying environmental conditions, impacts the model's optimization capabilities. Moreover, imbalances in wind turbine data lead to models that tend to favor recognizing majority classes, thus neglecting critical icing anomalies. To tackle these challenges, we propose a federated prototype learning model for class-imbalanced data in heterogeneous environments to detect wind turbine blade icing. We also propose a contrastive supervised loss function to address the class imbalance problem. Experiments on real data from 20 turbines across two wind farms show our method outperforms five FL models and five class imbalance methods, with an average improvement of 19.64\% in \( mF_{\beta} \) and 5.73\% in \( m \)BA compared to the second-best method, BiFL.</description>

      <title>MFRS: A Multi-Frequency Reference Series Approach to Scalable and Accurate Time-Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate time-series forecasting holds immense value across diverse applications, requiring methods to effectively capture complex temporal and inter-variable dynamics. A key challenge lies in uncovering the intrinsic patterns that govern predictability, beyond conventional designs, focusing on network architectures to explore latent relationships or temporal dependencies. Inspired by signal decomposition, this paper posits that time series predictability is derived from periodic characteristics at different frequencies. Consequently, we propose a novel time series forecasting method based on multi-frequency reference series correlation analysis. Through spectral analysis on long-term training data, we identify dominant spectral components and their harmonics to design base-pattern reference series. Unlike signal decomposition, which represents the original series as a linear combination of basis signals, our method uses a transformer model to compute cross-attention between the original series and reference series, capturing essential features for forecasting. Experiments on major open and synthetic datasets show state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, by focusing on attention with a small number of reference series rather than pairwise variable attention, our method ensures scalability and broad applicability.

      <title>Flexible and Efficient Probabilistic PDE Solvers through Gaussian Markov Random Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanistic knowledge about the physical world is virtually always expressed via partial differential equations (PDEs). Recently, there has been a surge of interest in probabilistic PDE solvers -- Bayesian statistical models mostly based on Gaussian process (GP) priors which seamlessly combine empirical measurements and mechanistic knowledge. As such, they quantify uncertainties arising from e.g. noisy or missing data, unknown PDE parameters or discretization error by design. Prior work has established connections to classical PDE solvers and provided solid theoretical guarantees. However, scaling such methods to large-scale problems remains a fundamental challenge primarily due to dense covariance matrices. Our approach addresses the scalability issues by leveraging the Markov property of many commonly used GP priors. It has been shown that such priors are solutions to stochastic PDEs (SPDEs) which when discretized allow for highly efficient GP regression through sparse linear algebra. In this work, we show how to leverage this prior class to make probabilistic PDE solvers practical, even for large-scale nonlinear PDEs, through greatly accelerated inference mechanisms. Additionally, our approach also allows for flexible and physically meaningful priors beyond what can be modeled with covariance functions. Experiments confirm substantial speedups and accelerated convergence of our physics-informed priors in nonlinear settings.</description>

      <title>Density Ratio-based Proxy Causal Learning Without Density Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the setting of Proxy Causal Learning (PCL), which has the goal of estimating causal effects from observed data in the presence of hidden confounding. Proxy methods accomplish this task using two proxy variables related to the latent confounder: a treatment proxy (related to the treatment) and an outcome proxy (related to the outcome). Two approaches have been proposed to perform causal effect estimation given proxy variables; however only one of these has found mainstream acceptance, since the other was understood to require density ratio estimation - a challenging task in high dimensions. In the present work, we propose a practical and effective implementation of the second approach, which bypasses explicit density ratio estimation and is suitable for continuous and high-dimensional treatments. We employ kernel ridge regression to derive estimators, resulting in simple closed-form solutions for dose-response and conditional dose-response curves, along with consistency guarantees. Our methods empirically demonstrate superior or comparable performance to existing frameworks on synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>V-Max: Making RL practical for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based decision-making has the potential to enable generalizable Autonomous Driving (AD) policies, reducing the engineering overhead of rule-based approaches. Imitation Learning (IL) remains the dominant paradigm, benefiting from large-scale human demonstration datasets, but it suffers from inherent limitations such as distribution shift and imitation gaps. Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising alternative, yet its adoption in AD remains limited due to the lack of standardized and efficient research frameworks. To this end, we introduce V-Max, an open research framework providing all the necessary tools to make RL practical for AD. V-Max is built on Waymax, a hardware-accelerated AD simulator designed for large-scale experimentation. We extend it using ScenarioNet's approach, enabling the fast simulation of diverse AD datasets. V-Max integrates a set of observation and reward functions, transformer-based encoders, and training pipelines. Additionally, it includes adversarial evaluation settings and an extensive set of evaluation metrics. Through a large-scale benchmark, we analyze how network architectures, observation functions, training data, and reward shaping impact RL performance.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for Multi-fidelity Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work focuses on gathering high-fidelity and low-fidelity numerical simulations data using Nektar++ (Solver based on Applied Mathematics) and XFOIL respectively. The utilization of the higher polynomial distribution in calculating the Coefficient of lift and drag has demonstrated superior accuracy and precision. Further, Co-kriging Data fusion and Adaptive sampling technique has been used to obtain the precise data predictions for the lift and drag within the confined domain without conducting the costly simulations on HPC clusters. This creates a methodology to quantifying uncertainty in computational fluid dynamics by minimizing the required number of samples. To minimize the reliability on high-fidelity numerical simulations in Uncertainty Quantification, a multi-fidelity strategy has been adopted. The effectiveness of the multi-fidelity deep neural network model has been validated through the approximation of benchmark functions across 1-, 32-, and 100-dimensional, encompassing both linear and nonlinear correlations. The surrogate modelling results showed that multi-fidelity deep neural network model has shown excellent approximation capabilities for the test functions and multi-fidelity deep neural network method has outperformed Co-kriging in effectiveness. In addition to that, multi-fidelity deep neural network model is utilized for the simulation of aleatory uncertainty propagation in 1-, 32-, and 100 dimensional function test, considering both uniform and Gaussian distributions for input uncertainties. The results have shown that multi-fidelity deep neural network model has efficiently predicted the probability density distributions of quantities of interest as well as the statistical moments with precision and accuracy. The Co-Kriging model has exhibited limitations when addressing 32-Dimension problems due to the limitation of memory capacity for storage and manipulation.</description>

      <title>A Deep-Learning Iterative Stacked Approach for Prediction of Reactive Dissolution in Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating reactive dissolution of solid minerals in porous media has many subsurface applications, including carbon capture and storage (CCS), geothermal systems and oil &amp; gas recovery. As traditional direct numerical simulators are computationally expensive, it is of paramount importance to develop faster and more efficient alternatives. Deep-learning-based solutions, most of them built upon convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been recently designed to tackle this problem. However, these solutions were limited to approximating one field over the domain (e.g. velocity field). In this manuscript, we present a novel deep learning approach that incorporates both temporal and spatial information to predict the future states of the dissolution process at a fixed time-step horizon, given a sequence of input states. The overall performance, in terms of speed and prediction accuracy, is demonstrated on a numerical simulation dataset, comparing its prediction results against state-of-the-art approaches, also achieving a speedup around $10^4$ over traditional numerical simulators.</description>

      <title>Accelerating MoE Model Inference with Expert Sharding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture of experts (MoE) models achieve state-of-the-art results in language modeling but suffer from inefficient hardware utilization due to imbalanced token routing and communication overhead. While prior work has focused on optimizing MoE training and decoder architectures, inference for encoder-based MoE models in a multi-GPU with expert parallelism setting remains underexplored. We introduce MoEShard, an inference system that achieves perfect load balancing through tensor sharding of MoE experts. Unlike existing approaches that rely on heuristic capacity factors or drop tokens, MoEShard evenly distributes computation across GPUs and ensures full token retention, maximizing utilization regardless of routing skewness. We achieve this through a strategic row- and column-wise decomposition of expert matrices. This reduces idle time and avoids bottlenecks caused by imbalanced expert assignments. Furthermore, MoEShard minimizes kernel launches by fusing decomposed expert computations, significantly improving throughput. We evaluate MoEShard against DeepSpeed on encoder-based architectures, demonstrating speedups of up to 6.4$\times$ in time to first token (TTFT). Our results show that tensor sharding, when properly applied to experts, is a viable and effective strategy for efficient MoE inference.</description>

      <title>A Triple-Inertial Accelerated Alternating Optimization Method for Deep Learning Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm has achieved remarkable success in training deep learning models. However, it has several limitations, including susceptibility to vanishing gradients, sensitivity to input data, and a lack of robust theoretical guarantees. In recent years, alternating minimization (AM) methods have emerged as a promising alternative for model training by employing gradient-free approaches to iteratively update model parameters. Despite their potential, these methods often exhibit slow convergence rates. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Triple-Inertial Accelerated Alternating Minimization (TIAM) framework for neural network training. The TIAM approach incorporates a triple-inertial acceleration strategy with a specialized approximation method, facilitating targeted acceleration of different terms in each sub-problem optimization. This integration improves the efficiency of convergence, achieving superior performance with fewer iterations. Additionally, we provide a convergence analysis of the TIAM algorithm, including its global convergence properties and convergence rate. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the TIAM method, showing significant improvements in generalization capability and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches, particularly when applied to the rectified linear unit (ReLU) and its variants.</description>

      <title>MMRL: Multi-Modal Representation Learning for Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become essential for transfer learning across diverse tasks. However, adapting these models with limited few-shot data often leads to overfitting, diminishing their performance on new tasks. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Representation Learning (MMRL) framework that introduces a shared, learnable, and modality-agnostic representation space. MMRL projects the space tokens to text and image representation tokens, facilitating more effective multi-modal interactions. Unlike previous approaches that solely optimize class token features, MMRL integrates representation tokens at higher layers of the encoders--where dataset-specific features are more prominent--while preserving generalized knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both representation and class features are optimized, with trainable projection layer applied to the representation tokens, whereas the class token projection layer remains frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. Furthermore, a regularization term is introduced to align the class features and text features with the zero-shot features from the frozen VLM, thereby safeguarding the model's generalization capacity. For inference, a decoupling strategy is employed, wherein both representation and class features are utilized for base classes, while only the class features, which retain more generalized knowledge, are used for new tasks. Extensive experiments across 15 datasets demonstrate that MMRL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a balanced trade-off between task-specific adaptation and generalization.

      <title>Learning to Match Unpaired Data with Minimum Entropy Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal data is a precious asset enabling a variety of downstream tasks in machine learning. However, real-world data collected across different modalities is often not paired, which is a significant challenge to learn a joint distribution. A prominent approach to address the modality coupling problem is Minimum Entropy Coupling (MEC), which seeks to minimize the joint Entropy, while satisfying constraints on the marginals. Existing approaches to the MEC problem focus on finite, discrete distributions, limiting their application for cases involving continuous data. In this work, we propose a novel method to solve the continuous MEC problem, using well-known generative diffusion models that learn to approximate and minimize the joint Entropy through a cooperative scheme, while satisfying a relaxed version of the marginal constraints. We empirically demonstrate that our method, DDMEC, is general and can be easily used to address challenging tasks, including unsupervised single-cell multi-omics data alignment and unpaired image translation, outperforming specialized methods.</description>

      <title>The Space Between: On Folding, Symmetries and Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent findings suggest that consecutive layers of neural networks with the ReLU activation function \emph{fold} the input space during the learning process. While many works hint at this phenomenon, an approach to quantify the folding was only recently proposed by means of a space folding measure based on Hamming distance in the ReLU activation space. We generalize this measure to a wider class of activation functions through introduction of equivalence classes of input data, analyse its mathematical and computational properties and come up with an efficient sampling strategy for its implementation. Moreover, it has been observed that space folding values increase with network depth when the generalization error is low, but decrease when the error increases. This underpins that learned symmetries in the data manifold (e.g., invariance under reflection) become visible in terms of space folds, contributing to the network's generalization capacity. Inspired by these findings, we outline a novel regularization scheme that encourages the network to seek solutions characterized by higher folding values.</description>

      <title>DISTINGUISH Workflow: A New Paradigm of Dynamic Well Placement Using Generative Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real-time process of directional changes while drilling, known as geosteering, is crucial for hydrocarbon extraction and emerging directional drilling applications such as geothermal energy, civil infrastructure, and CO2 storage. The geo-energy industry seeks an automatic geosteering workflow that continually updates the subsurface uncertainties and captures the latest geological understanding given the most recent observations in real-time.
  We propose "DISTINGUISH": a real-time, AI-driven workflow designed to transform geosteering by integrating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for geological parameterization, ensemble methods for model updating, and global discrete dynamic programming (DDP) optimization for complex decision-making during directional drilling operations. The DISTINGUISH framework relies on offline training of a GAN model to reproduce relevant geology realizations and a Forward Neural Network (FNN) to model Logging-While-Drilling (LWD) tools' response for a given geomodel.
  This paper introduces a first-of-its-kind workflow that progressively reduces GAN-geomodel uncertainty around and ahead of the drilling bit and adjusts the well plan accordingly. The workflow automatically integrates real-time LWD data with a DDP-based decision support system, enhancing predictive models of geology ahead of drilling and leading to better steering decisions. We present a simple yet representative benchmark case and document the performance target achieved by the DISTINGUISH workflow prototype. This benchmark will be a foundation for future methodological advancements and workflow refinements.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Safety Guarantees in Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many practical scenarios of black box optimization, the objective function is subject to constraints that must be satisfied to avoid undesirable outcomes. Such constraints are typically unknown and must be learned during optimization. Safe Bayesian optimization aims to find the global optimum while ensuring that the constraints are satisfied with high probability. However, it is often sample-inefficient due to the small initial feasible set, which requires expansion by evaluating the objective or constraint functions, limiting its applicability to low-dimensional or inexpensive problems. To enhance sample efficiency, additional information from cheap simulations can be leveraged, albeit at the cost of safeness guarantees. This paper introduces a novel safe multi-task Bayesian optimization algorithm that integrates multiple tasks while maintaining high-probability safety. We derive robust uniform error bounds for the multi-task case and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on benchmark functions and a control problem. Our results show a significant improvement in sample efficiency, making the proposed method well-suited for expensive-to-evaluate functions.</description>

      <title>CellStyle: Improved Zero-Shot Cell Segmentation via Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell microscopy data are abundant; however, corresponding segmentation annotations remain scarce. Moreover, variations in cell types, imaging devices, and staining techniques introduce significant domain gaps between datasets. As a result, even large, pretrained segmentation models trained on diverse datasets (source datasets) struggle to generalize to unseen datasets (target datasets). To overcome this generalization problem, we propose CellStyle, which improves the segmentation quality of such models without requiring labels for the target dataset, thereby enabling zero-shot adaptation. CellStyle transfers the attributes of an unannotated target dataset, such as texture, color, and noise, to the annotated source dataset. This transfer is performed while preserving the cell shapes of the source images, ensuring that the existing source annotations can still be used while maintaining the visual characteristics of the target dataset. The styled synthetic images with the existing annotations enable the finetuning of a generalist segmentation model for application to the unannotated target data. We demonstrate that CellStyle significantly improves zero-shot cell segmentation performance across diverse datasets by finetuning multiple segmentation models on the style-transferred data. The code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>How Does Overparameterization Affect Machine Unlearning of Deep Neural Networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning is the task of updating a trained model to forget specific training data without retraining from scratch. In this paper, we investigate how unlearning of deep neural networks (DNNs) is affected by the model parameterization level, which corresponds here to the DNN width. We define validation-based tuning for several unlearning methods from the recent literature, and show how these methods perform differently depending on (i) the DNN parameterization level, (ii) the unlearning goal (unlearned data privacy or bias removal), (iii) whether the unlearning method explicitly uses the unlearned examples. Our results show that unlearning excels on overparameterized models, in terms of balancing between generalization and achieving the unlearning goal; although for bias removal this requires the unlearning method to use the unlearned examples. We further elucidate our error-based analysis by measuring how much the unlearning changes the classification decision regions in the proximity of the unlearned examples, and avoids changing them elsewhere. By this we show that the unlearning success for overparameterized models stems from the ability to delicately change the model functionality in small regions in the input space while keeping much of the model functionality unchanged.</description>

      <title>Birds look like cars: Adversarial analysis of intrinsically interpretable deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common belief is that intrinsically interpretable deep learning models ensure a correct, intuitive understanding of their behavior and offer greater robustness against accidental errors or intentional manipulation. However, these beliefs have not been comprehensively verified, and growing evidence casts doubt on them. In this paper, we highlight the risks related to overreliance and susceptibility to adversarial manipulation of these so-called "intrinsically (aka inherently) interpretable" models by design. We introduce two strategies for adversarial analysis with prototype manipulation and backdoor attacks against prototype-based networks, and discuss how concept bottleneck models defend against these attacks. Fooling the model's reasoning by exploiting its use of latent prototypes manifests the inherent uninterpretability of deep neural networks, leading to a false sense of security reinforced by a visual confirmation bias. The reported limitations of prototype-based networks put their trustworthiness and applicability into question, motivating further work on the robustness and alignment of (deep) interpretable models.</description>

      <title>Coefficient-to-Basis Network: A Fine-Tunable Operator Learning Framework for Inverse Problems with Adaptive Discretizations and Theoretical Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Coefficient-to-Basis Network (C2BNet), a novel framework for solving inverse problems within the operator learning paradigm. C2BNet efficiently adapts to different discretizations through fine-tuning, using a pre-trained model to significantly reduce computational cost while maintaining high accuracy. Unlike traditional approaches that require retraining from scratch for new discretizations, our method enables seamless adaptation without sacrificing predictive performance. Furthermore, we establish theoretical approximation and generalization error bounds for C2BNet by exploiting low-dimensional structures in the underlying datasets. Our analysis demonstrates that C2BNet adapts to low-dimensional structures without relying on explicit encoding mechanisms, highlighting its robustness and efficiency. To validate our theoretical findings, we conducted extensive numerical experiments that showcase the superior performance of C2BNet on several inverse problems. The results confirm that C2BNet effectively balances computational efficiency and accuracy, making it a promising tool to solve inverse problems in scientific computing and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Extra Clients at No Extra Cost: Overcome Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning with Filter Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data heterogeneity is one of the major challenges in federated learning (FL), which results in substantial client variance and slow convergence. In this study, we propose a novel solution: decomposing a convolutional filter in FL into a linear combination of filter subspace elements, i.e., filter atoms. This simple technique transforms global filter aggregation in FL into aggregating filter atoms and their atom coefficients. The key advantage here involves mathematically generating numerous cross-terms by expanding the product of two weighted sums from filter atom and atom coefficient. These cross-terms effectively emulate many additional latent clients, significantly reducing model variance, which is validated by our theoretical analysis and empirical observation. Furthermore, our method permits different training schemes for filter atoms and atom coefficients for highly adaptive model personalization and communication efficiency. Empirical results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our filter decomposition technique substantially improves the accuracy of FL methods, confirming its efficacy in addressing data heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Mitigating Distribution Shifts For Machine Learning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) are a promising alternative to expensive ab initio quantum mechanical molecular simulations. Given the diversity of chemical spaces that are of interest and the cost of generating new data, it is important to understand how MLFFs generalize beyond their training distributions. In order to characterize and better understand distribution shifts in MLFFs, we conduct diagnostic experiments on chemical datasets, revealing common shifts that pose significant challenges, even for large foundation models trained on extensive data. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that current supervised training methods inadequately regularize MLFFs, resulting in overfitting and learning poor representations of out-of-distribution systems. We then propose two new methods as initial steps for mitigating distribution shifts for MLFFs. Our methods focus on test-time refinement strategies that incur minimal computational cost and do not use expensive ab initio reference labels. The first strategy, based on spectral graph theory, modifies the edges of test graphs to align with graph structures seen during training. Our second strategy improves representations for out-of-distribution systems at test-time by taking gradient steps using an auxiliary objective, such as a cheap physical prior. Our test-time refinement strategies significantly reduce errors on out-of-distribution systems, suggesting that MLFFs are capable of and can move towards modeling diverse chemical spaces, but are not being effectively trained to do so. Our experiments establish clear benchmarks for evaluating the generalization capabilities of the next generation of MLFFs. Our code is available at https://tkreiman.github.io/projects/mlff_distribution_shifts/.</description>

      <title>COMODO: Cross-Modal Video-to-IMU Distillation for Efficient Egocentric Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Egocentric video-based models capture rich semantic information and have demonstrated strong performance in human activity recognition (HAR). However, their high power consumption, privacy concerns, and dependence on lighting conditions limit their feasibility for continuous on-device recognition. In contrast, inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors offer an energy-efficient and privacy-preserving alternative, yet they suffer from limited large-scale annotated datasets, leading to weaker generalization in downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose COMODO, a cross-modal self-supervised distillation framework that transfers rich semantic knowledge from the video modality to the IMU modality without requiring labeled annotations. COMODO leverages a pretrained and frozen video encoder to construct a dynamic instance queue, aligning the feature distributions of video and IMU embeddings. By distilling knowledge from video representations, our approach enables the IMU encoder to inherit rich semantic information from video while preserving its efficiency for real-world applications. Experiments on multiple egocentric HAR datasets demonstrate that COMODO consistently improves downstream classification performance, achieving results comparable to or exceeding fully supervised fine-tuned models. Moreover, COMODO exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization. Benefiting from its simplicity, our method is also generally applicable to various video and time-series pre-trained models, offering the potential to leverage more powerful teacher and student foundation models in future research. The code is available at https://github.com/Breezelled/COMODO .</description>

      <title>Physics- and data-driven Active Learning of neural network representations for free energy functions of materials from statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate free energy representations are crucial for understanding phase dynamics in materials. We employ a scale-bridging approach to incorporate atomistic information into our free energy model by training a neural network on DFT-informed Monte Carlo data. To optimize sampling in the high-dimensional Monte Carlo space, we present an Active Learning framework that integrates space-filling sampling, uncertainty-based sampling, and physics-informed sampling. Additionally, our approach includes methods such as hyperparameter tuning, dynamic sampling, and novelty enforcement. These strategies can be combined to reduce MSE,either globally or in targeted regions of interest,while minimizing the number of required data points. The framework introduced here is broadly applicable to Monte Carlo sampling of a range of materials systems.</description>

      <title>Research on Superalignment Should Advance Now with Parallel Optimization of Competence and Conformity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent leap in AI capabilities, driven by big generative models, has sparked the possibility of achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and further triggered discussions on Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), a system surpassing all humans across all domains. This gives rise to the critical research question of: If we realize ASI, how do we align it with human values, ensuring it benefits rather than harms human society, a.k.a., the Superalignment problem. Despite ASI being regarded by many as solely a hypothetical concept, in this paper, we argue that superalignment is achievable and research on it should advance immediately, through simultaneous and alternating optimization of task competence and value conformity. We posit that superalignment is not merely a safeguard for ASI but also necessary for its realization. To support this position, we first provide a formal definition of superalignment rooted in the gap between capability and capacity and elaborate on our argument. Then we review existing paradigms, explore their interconnections and limitations, and illustrate a potential path to superalignment centered on two fundamental principles. We hope this work sheds light on a practical approach for developing the value-aligned next-generation AI, garnering greater benefits and reducing potential harms for humanity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Antibiotic Resistance Microbiology Dataset (ARMD) is a de-identified resource derived from electronic health records (EHR) that facilitates research into antimicrobial resistance (AMR). ARMD encompasses data from adult patients, focusing on microbiological cultures, antibiotic susceptibilities, and associated clinical and demographic features. Key attributes include organism identification, susceptibility patterns for 55 antibiotics, implied susceptibility rules, and de-identified patient information. This dataset supports studies on antimicrobial stewardship, causal inference, and clinical decision-making. ARMD is designed to be reusable and interoperable, promoting collaboration and innovation in combating AMR. This paper describes the dataset's acquisition, structure, and utility while detailing its de-identification process.</description>

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Positive Non-Clashing Teaching in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the classical and parameterized complexity of computing the positive non-clashing teaching dimension of a set of concepts, that is, the smallest number of examples per concept required to successfully teach an intelligent learner under the considered, previously established model. For any class of concepts, it is known that this problem can be effortlessly transferred to the setting of balls in a graph G. We establish (1) the NP-hardness of the problem even when restricted to instances with positive non-clashing teaching dimension k=2 and where all balls in the graph are present, (2) near-tight running time upper and lower bounds for the problem on general graphs, (3) fixed-parameter tractability when parameterized by the vertex integrity of G, and (4) a lower bound excluding fixed-parameter tractability when parameterized by the feedback vertex number and pathwidth of G, even when combined with k. Our results provide a nearly complete understanding of the complexity landscape of computing the positive non-clashing teaching dimension and answer open questions from the literature.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Shielding for Safe Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real-life scenarios, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent aiming to maximise their reward, must often also behave in a safe manner, including at training time. Thus, much attention in recent years has been given to Safe RL, where an agent aims to learn an optimal policy among all policies that satisfy a given safety constraint. However, strict safety guarantees are often provided through approaches based on linear programming, and thus have limited scaling. In this paper we present a new, scalable method, which enjoys strict formal guarantees for Safe RL, in the case where the safety dynamics of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) are known, and safety is defined as an undiscounted probabilistic avoidance property. Our approach is based on state-augmentation of the MDP, and on the design of a shield that restricts the actions available to the agent. We show that our approach provides a strict formal safety guarantee that the agent stays safe at training and test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach is viable in practice through experimental evaluation.</description>

      <title>Personalized Convolutional Dictionary Learning of Physiological Time Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human physiological signals tend to exhibit both global and local structures: the former are shared across a population, while the latter reflect inter-individual variability. For instance, kinetic measurements of the gait cycle during locomotion present common characteristics, although idiosyncrasies may be observed due to biomechanical disposition or pathology. To better represent datasets with local-global structure, this work extends Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL), a popular method for learning interpretable representations, or dictionaries, of time-series data. In particular, we propose Personalized CDL (PerCDL), in which a local dictionary models local information as a personalized spatiotemporal transformation of a global dictionary. The transformation is learnable and can combine operations such as time warping and rotation. Formal computational and statistical guarantees for PerCDL are provided and its effectiveness on synthetic and real human locomotion data is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Fully Autonomous Programming using Iterative Multi-Agent Debugging with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Program synthesis with Large Language Models (LLMs) suffers from a "near-miss syndrome": the generated code closely resembles a correct solution but fails unit tests due to minor errors. We address this with a multi-agent framework called Synthesize, Execute, Instruct, Debug, and Repair (SEIDR). Effectively applying SEIDR to instruction-tuned LLMs requires determining (a) optimal prompts for LLMs, (b) what ranking algorithm selects the best programs in debugging rounds, and (c) balancing the repair of unsuccessful programs with the generation of new ones. We empirically explore these trade-offs by comparing replace-focused, repair-focused, and hybrid debug strategies. We also evaluate lexicase and tournament selection to rank candidates in each generation. On Program Synthesis Benchmark 2 (PSB2), our framework outperforms both conventional use of OpenAI Codex without a repair phase and traditional genetic programming approaches. SEIDR outperforms the use of an LLM alone, solving 18 problems in C++ and 20 in Python on PSB2 at least once across experiments. To assess generalizability, we employ GPT-3.5 and Llama 3 on the PSB2 and HumanEval-X benchmarks. Although SEIDR with these models does not surpass current state-of-the-art methods on the Python benchmarks, the results on HumanEval-C++ are promising. SEIDR with Llama 3-8B achieves an average pass@100 of 84.2%. Across all SEIDR runs, 163 of 164 problems are solved at least once with GPT-3.5 in HumanEval-C++, and 162 of 164 with the smaller Llama 3-8B. We conclude that SEIDR effectively overcomes the near-miss syndrome in program synthesis with LLMs.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification and posterior sampling for network reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network reconstruction is the task of inferring the unseen interactions between elements of a system, based only on their behavior or dynamics. This inverse problem is in general ill-posed, and admits many solutions for the same observation. Nevertheless, the vast majority of statistical methods proposed for this task -- formulated as the inference of a graphical generative model -- can only produce a ``point estimate,'' i.e. a single network considered the most likely. In general, this can give only a limited characterization of the reconstruction, since uncertainties and competing answers cannot be conveyed, even if their probabilities are comparable, while being structurally different. In this work we present an efficient MCMC algorithm for sampling from posterior distributions of reconstructed networks, which is able to reveal the full population of answers for a given reconstruction problem, weighted according to their plausibilities. Our algorithm is general, since it does not rely on specific properties of particular generative models, and is specially suited for the inference of large and sparse networks, since in this case an iteration can be performed in time $O(N\log^2 N)$ for a network of $N$ nodes, instead of $O(N^2)$, as would be the case for a more naive approach. We demonstrate the suitability of our method in providing uncertainties and consensus of solutions (which provably increases the reconstruction accuracy) in a variety of synthetic and empirical cases.</description>

      <title>SegResMamba: An Efficient Architecture for 3D Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Transformer architecture has opened a new paradigm in the domain of deep learning with its ability to model long-range dependencies and capture global context and has outpaced the traditional Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) in many aspects. However, applying Transformer models to 3D medical image datasets presents significant challenges due to their high training time, and memory requirements, which not only hinder scalability but also contribute to elevated CO$_2$ footprint. This has led to an exploration of alternative models that can maintain or even improve performance while being more efficient and environmentally sustainable. Recent advancements in Structured State Space Models (SSMs) effectively address some of the inherent limitations of Transformers, particularly their high memory and computational demands. Inspired by these advancements, we propose an efficient 3D segmentation model for medical imaging called SegResMamba, designed to reduce computation complexity, memory usage, training time, and environmental impact while maintaining high performance. Our model uses less than half the memory during training compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) architectures, achieving comparable performance with significantly reduced resource demands.</description>

      <title>EAZY: Eliminating Hallucinations in LVLMs by Zeroing out Hallucinatory Image Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their remarkable potential, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still face challenges with object hallucination, a problem where their generated outputs mistakenly incorporate objects that do not actually exist. Although most works focus on addressing this issue within the language-model backbone, our work shifts the focus to the image input source, investigating how specific image tokens contribute to hallucinations. Our analysis reveals a striking finding: a small subset of image tokens with high attention scores are the primary drivers of object hallucination. By removing these hallucinatory image tokens (only 1.5% of all image tokens), the issue can be effectively mitigated. This finding holds consistently across different models and datasets. Building on this insight, we introduce EAZY, a novel, training-free method that automatically identifies and Eliminates hAllucinations by Zeroing out hallucinatorY image tokens. We utilize EAZY for unsupervised object hallucination detection, achieving 15% improvement compared to previous methods. Additionally, EAZY demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations while preserving model utility and seamlessly adapting to various LVLM architectures.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Normality Learning and Divergence Vector-guided Model Merging for Zero-shot Congenital Heart Disease Detection in Fetal Ultrasound Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is one of the leading causes of fetal mortality, yet the scarcity of labeled CHD data and strict privacy regulations surrounding fetal ultrasound (US) imaging present significant challenges for the development of deep learning-based models for CHD detection. Centralised collection of large real-world datasets for rare conditions, such as CHD, from large populations requires significant co-ordination and resource. In addition, data governance rules increasingly prevent data sharing between sites. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, a novel privacy-preserving, zero-shot CHD detection framework that formulates CHD detection as a normality modeling problem integrated with model merging. In our framework dubbed Sparse Tube Ultrasound Distillation (STUD), each hospital site first trains a sparse video tube-based self-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) model on normal fetal heart US clips with self-distillation loss. This enables site-specific models to independently learn the distribution of healthy cases. To aggregate knowledge across the decentralized models while maintaining privacy, we propose a Divergence Vector-Guided Model Merging approach, DivMerge, that combines site-specific models into a single VAD model without data exchange. Our approach preserves domain-agnostic rich spatio-temporal representations, ensuring generalization to unseen CHD cases. We evaluated our approach on real-world fetal US data collected from 5 hospital sites. Our merged model outperformed site-specific models by 23.77% and 30.13% in accuracy and F1-score respectively on external test sets.</description>

      <title>Towards Large Language Models that Benefit for All: Benchmarking Group Fairness in Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly powerful and accessible to human users, ensuring fairness across diverse demographic groups, i.e., group fairness, is a critical ethical concern. However, current fairness and bias research in LLMs is limited in two aspects. First, compared to traditional group fairness in machine learning classification, it requires that the non-sensitive attributes, in this case, the prompt questions, be the same across different groups. In many practical scenarios, different groups, however, may prefer different prompt questions and this requirement becomes impractical. Second, it evaluates group fairness only for the LLM's final output without identifying the source of possible bias. Namely, the bias in LLM's output can result from both the pretraining and the finetuning. For finetuning, the bias can result from both the RLHF procedure and the learned reward model. Arguably, evaluating the group fairness of each component in the LLM pipeline could help develop better methods to mitigate the possible bias. Recognizing those two limitations, this work benchmarks the group fairness of learned reward models. By using expert-written text from arXiv, we are able to benchmark the group fairness of reward models without requiring the same prompt questions across different demographic groups. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that all the evaluated reward models (e.g., Nemotron-4-340B-Reward, ArmoRM-Llama3-8B-v0.1, and GRM-llama3-8B-sftreg) exhibit statistically significant group unfairness. We also observed that top-performing reward models (w.r.t. canonical performance metrics) tend to demonstrate better group fairness.</description>

      <title>Training Domain Draft Models for Speculative Decoding: Best Practices and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective method for accelerating inference of large language models (LLMs) by employing a small draft model to predict the output of a target model. However, when adapting speculative decoding to domain-specific target models, the acceptance rate of the generic draft model drops significantly due to domain shift. In this work, we systematically investigate knowledge distillation techniques for training domain draft models to improve their speculation accuracy. We compare white-box and black-box distillation approaches and explore their effectiveness in various data accessibility scenarios, including historical user queries, curated domain data, and synthetically generated alignment data. Our experiments across Function Calling, Biology, and Chinese domains show that offline distillation consistently outperforms online distillation by 11% to 25%, white-box distillation surpasses black-box distillation by 2% to 10%, and data scaling trends hold across domains. Additionally, we find that synthetic data can effectively align draft models and achieve 80% to 93% of the performance of training on historical user queries. These findings provide practical guidelines for training domain-specific draft models to improve speculative decoding efficiency.</description>

      <title>AgriField3D: A Curated 3D Point Cloud and Procedural Model Dataset of Field-Grown Maize from a Diversity Panel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in three-dimensional (3D) agricultural research, particularly for maize, has been limited by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse datasets. While 2D image datasets are abundant, they fail to capture essential structural details such as leaf architecture, plant volume, and spatial arrangements that 3D data provide. To address this limitation, we present AgriField3D (https://baskargroup.github.io/AgriField3D/), a curated dataset of 3D point clouds of field-grown maize plants from a diverse genetic panel, designed to be AI-ready for advancing agricultural research. Our dataset comprises over 1,000 high-quality point clouds collected using a Terrestrial Laser Scanner, complemented by procedural models that provide structured, parametric representations of maize plants. These procedural models, generated using Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) and optimized via a two-step process combining Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and differentiable programming, enable precise, scalable reconstructions of leaf surfaces and plant architectures. To enhance usability, we performed graph-based segmentation to isolate individual leaves and stalks, ensuring consistent labeling across all samples. We also conducted rigorous manual quality control on all datasets, correcting errors in segmentation, ensuring accurate leaf ordering, and validating metadata annotations. The dataset further includes metadata detailing plant morphology and quality, alongside multi-resolution subsampled versions (100k, 50k, 10k points) optimized for various computational needs. By integrating point cloud data of field grown plants with high-fidelity procedural models and ensuring meticulous manual validation, AgriField3D provides a comprehensive foundation for AI-driven phenotyping, plant structural analysis, and 3D applications in agricultural research.</description>

      <title>Reproducibility and Artifact Consistency of the SIGIR 2022 Recommender Systems Papers Based on Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph-based techniques relying on neural networks and embeddings have gained attention as a way to develop Recommender Systems (RS) with several papers on the topic presented at SIGIR 2022 and 2023. Given the importance of ensuring that published research is methodologically sound and reproducible, in this paper we analyze 10 graph-based RS papers, most of which were published at SIGIR 2022, and assess their impact on subsequent work published in SIGIR 2023. Our analysis reveals several critical points that require attention: (i) the prevalence of bad practices, such as erroneous data splits or information leakage between training and testing data, which call into question the validity of the results; (ii) frequent inconsistencies between the provided artifacts (source code and data) and their descriptions in the paper, causing uncertainty about what is actually being evaluated; and (iii) the preference for new or complex baselines that are weaker compared to simpler ones, creating the impression of continuous improvement even when, particularly for the Amazon-Book dataset, the state-of-the-art has significantly worsened. Due to these issues, we are unable to confirm the claims made in most of the papers we examined and attempted to reproduce.</description>

      <title>Pure Exploration with Feedback Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of pure exploration in an online learning problem with a feedback graph. This graph dictates the feedback available to the learner, covering scenarios between full-information, pure bandit feedback, and settings with no feedback on the chosen action. While variants of this problem have been investigated for regret minimization, no prior work has addressed the pure exploration setting, which is the focus of our study. We derive an instance-specific lower bound on the sample complexity of learning the best action with fixed confidence, even when the feedback graph is unknown and stochastic, and present unidentifiability results for Bernoulli rewards. Additionally, our findings reveal how the sample complexity scales with key graph-dependent quantities. Lastly, we introduce TaS-FG (Track and Stop for Feedback Graphs), an asymptotically optimal algorithm, and demonstrate its efficiency across different graph configurations.</description>

      <title>Helios 2.0: A Robust, Ultra-Low Power Gesture Recognition System Optimised for Event-Sensor based Wearables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an advance in wearable technology: a mobile-optimized, real-time, ultra-low-power event camera system that enables natural hand gesture control for smart glasses, dramatically improving user experience. While hand gesture recognition in computer vision has advanced significantly, critical challenges remain in creating systems that are intuitive, adaptable across diverse users and environments, and energy-efficient enough for practical wearable applications. Our approach tackles these challenges through carefully selected microgestures: lateral thumb swipes across the index finger (in both directions) and a double pinch between thumb and index fingertips. These human-centered interactions leverage natural hand movements, ensuring intuitive usability without requiring users to learn complex command sequences. To overcome variability in users and environments, we developed a novel simulation methodology that enables comprehensive domain sampling without extensive real-world data collection. Our power-optimised architecture maintains exceptional performance, achieving F1 scores above 80\% on benchmark datasets featuring diverse users and environments. The resulting models operate at just 6-8 mW when exploiting the Qualcomm Snapdragon Hexagon DSP, with our 2-channel implementation exceeding 70\% F1 accuracy and our 6-channel model surpassing 80\% F1 accuracy across all gesture classes in user studies. These results were achieved using only synthetic training data. This improves on the state-of-the-art for F1 accuracy by 20\% with a power reduction 25x when using DSP. This advancement brings deploying ultra-low-power vision systems in wearable devices closer and opens new possibilities for seamless human-computer interaction.</description>

      <title>RefactorBench: Evaluating Stateful Reasoning in Language Agents Through Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in language model (LM) agents and function calling have enabled autonomous, feedback-driven systems to solve problems across various digital domains. To better understand the unique limitations of LM agents, we introduce RefactorBench, a benchmark consisting of 100 large handcrafted multi-file refactoring tasks in popular open-source repositories. Solving tasks within RefactorBench requires thorough exploration of dependencies across multiple files and strong adherence to relevant instructions. Every task is defined by 3 natural language instructions of varying specificity and is mutually exclusive, allowing for the creation of longer combined tasks on the same repository. Baselines on RefactorBench reveal that current LM agents struggle with simple compositional tasks, solving only 22% of tasks with base instructions, in contrast to a human developer with short time constraints solving 87%. Through trajectory analysis, we identify various unique failure modes of LM agents, and further explore the failure mode of tracking past actions. By adapting a baseline agent to condition on representations of state, we achieve a 43.9% improvement in solving RefactorBench tasks. We further extend our state-aware approach to encompass entire digital environments and outline potential directions for future research. RefactorBench aims to support the study of LM agents by providing a set of real-world, multi-hop tasks within the realm of code.</description>

      <title>Learning and Evaluating Hierarchical Feature Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchy-aware representations ensure that the semantically closer classes are mapped closer in the feature space, thereby reducing the severity of mistakes while enabling consistent coarse-level class predictions. Towards this end, we propose a novel framework, Hierarchical Composition of Orthogonal Subspaces (Hier-COS), which learns to map deep feature embeddings into a vector space that is, by design, consistent with the structure of a given taxonomy tree. Our approach augments neural network backbones with a simple transformation module that maps learned discriminative features to subspaces defined using a fixed orthogonal frame. This construction naturally improves the severity of mistakes and promotes hierarchical consistency. Furthermore, we highlight the fundamental limitations of existing hierarchical evaluation metrics popularly used by the vision community and introduce a preference-based metric, Hierarchically Ordered Preference Score (HOPS), to overcome these limitations. We benchmark our method on multiple large and challenging datasets having deep label hierarchies (ranging from 3 - 12 levels) and compare with several baselines and SOTA. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Hier-COS achieves state-of-the-art hierarchical performance across all the datasets while simultaneously beating top-1 accuracy in all but one case. We also demonstrate the performance of a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone and show that learning a transformation module alone can map the learned features from a pre-trained ViT to Hier-COS and yield substantial performance benefits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How do two individuals differ when performing the same action? In this work, we introduce Video Action Differencing (VidDiff), the novel task of identifying subtle differences between videos of the same action, which has many applications, such as coaching and skill learning. To enable development on this new task, we first create VidDiffBench, a benchmark dataset containing 549 video pairs, with human annotations of 4,469 fine-grained action differences and 2,075 localization timestamps indicating where these differences occur. Our experiments demonstrate that VidDiffBench poses a significant challenge for state-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs), such as GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL. By analyzing failure cases of LMMs on VidDiffBench, we highlight two key challenges for this task: localizing relevant sub-actions over two videos and fine-grained frame comparison. To overcome these, we propose the VidDiff method, an agentic workflow that breaks the task into three stages: action difference proposal, keyframe localization, and frame differencing, each stage utilizing specialized foundation models. To encourage future research in this new task, we release the benchmark at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jmhb/VidDiffBench and code at http://jmhb0.github.io/viddiff.</description>

      <title>Cost-Aware Optimal Pairwise Pure Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pure exploration is one of the fundamental problems in multi-armed bandits (MAB). However, existing works mostly focus on specific pure exploration tasks, without a holistic view of the general pure exploration problem. This work fills this gap by introducing a versatile framework to study pure exploration, with a focus on identifying the pairwise relationships between targeted arm pairs. Moreover, unlike existing works that only optimize the stopping time (i.e., sample complexity), this work considers that arms are associated with potentially different costs and targets at optimizing the cumulative cost that occurred during learning. Under the general framework of pairwise pure exploration with arm-specific costs, a performance lower bound is derived. Then, a novel algorithm, termed CAET (Cost-Aware Pairwise Exploration Task), is proposed. CAET builds on the track-and-stop principle with a novel design to handle the arm-specific costs, which can potentially be zero and thus represent a very challenging case. Theoretical analyses prove that the performance of CAET approaches the lower bound asymptotically. Special cases are further discussed, including an extension to regret minimization, which is another major focus of MAB. The effectiveness and efficiency of CAET are also verified through experimental results under various settings.</description>

      <title>Datasets, Documents, and Repetitions: The Practicalities of Unequal Data Quality</title>

Abstract: Data filtering has become a powerful tool for improving model performance while reducing computational cost. However, as large language model compute budgets continue to grow, the limited data volume provided by heavily filtered and deduplicated datasets will become a practical constraint. In efforts to better understand how to proceed, we study model performance at various compute budgets and across multiple pre-training datasets created through data filtering and deduplication. We find that, given appropriate modifications to the training recipe, repeating existing aggressively filtered datasets for up to ten epochs can outperform training on the ten times larger superset for a single epoch across multiple compute budget orders of magnitude. While this finding relies on repeating the dataset for many epochs, we also investigate repeats within these datasets at the document level. We find that not all documents within a dataset are equal, and we can create better datasets relative to a token budget by explicitly manipulating the counts of individual documents. We conclude by arguing that even as large language models scale, data filtering remains an important direction of research.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Framework for Human-Robot Collaboration: Safety, Dynamic Ergonomics, and Adaptive Decision-Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of collaborative robots into industrial environments has improved productivity, but has also highlighted significant challenges related to operator safety and ergonomics. This paper proposes an innovative framework that integrates advanced visual perception technologies, real-time ergonomic monitoring, and Behaviour Tree (BT)-based adaptive decision-making. Unlike traditional methods, which often operate in isolation or statically, our approach combines deep learning models (YOLO11 and SlowOnly), advanced tracking (Unscented Kalman Filter) and dynamic ergonomic assessments (OWAS), offering a modular, scalable and adaptive system. Experimental results show that the framework outperforms previous methods in several aspects: accuracy in detecting postures and actions, adaptivity in managing human-robot interactions, and ability to reduce ergonomic risk through timely robotic interventions. In particular, the visual perception module showed superiority over YOLOv9 and YOLOv8, while real-time ergonomic monitoring eliminated the limitations of static analysis. Adaptive role management, made possible by the Behaviour Tree, provided greater responsiveness than rule-based systems, making the framework suitable for complex industrial scenarios. Our system demonstrated a 92.5\% accuracy in grasping intention recognition and successfully classified ergonomic risks with real-time responsiveness (average latency of 0.57 seconds), enabling timely robotic</description>

      <title>Can Memory-Augmented Language Models Generalize on Reasoning-in-a-Haystack Tasks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models often expose their brittleness in reasoning tasks, especially while executing long chains of reasoning over context. We propose MemReasoner, a new and simple memory-augmented LLM architecture, in which the memory learns the relative order of facts in context, and enables hopping over them, while the decoder selectively attends to the memory. MemReasoner is trained end-to-end, with optional supporting fact supervision of varying degrees. We train MemReasoner, along with existing memory-augmented transformer models and a state-space model, on two distinct synthetic multi-hop reasoning tasks. Experiments performed under a variety of challenging scenarios, including the presence of long distractor text or target answer changes in test set, show strong generalization of MemReasoner on both single- and two-hop tasks. This generalization of MemReasoner is achieved using none-to-weak supporting fact supervision (using none and 1\% of supporting facts for one- and two-hop tasks, respectively). In contrast, baseline models overall struggle to generalize and benefit far less from using full supporting fact supervision. The results highlight the importance of explicit memory mechanisms, combined with additional weak supervision, for improving large language model's context processing ability toward reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Demystifying the Accuracy-Interpretability Trade-Off: A Case Study of Inferring Ratings from Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpretable machine learning models offer understandable reasoning behind their decision-making process, though they may not always match the performance of their black-box counterparts. This trade-off between interpretability and model performance has sparked discussions around the deployment of AI, particularly in critical applications where knowing the rationale of decision-making is essential for trust and accountability. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of several black-box and interpretable models, focusing on a specific NLP use case that has received limited attention: inferring ratings from reviews. Through this use case, we explore the intricate relationship between the performance and interpretability of different models. We introduce a quantitative score called Composite Interpretability (CI) to help visualize the trade-off between interpretability and performance, particularly in the case of composite models. Our results indicate that, in general, the learning performance improves as interpretability decreases, but this relationship is not strictly monotonic, and there are instances where interpretable models are more advantageous.</description>

      <title>BEARCUBS: A benchmark for computer-using web agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern web agents possess computer use abilities that allow them to interact with webpages by sending commands to a virtual keyboard and mouse. While such agents have considerable potential to assist human users with complex tasks, evaluating their capabilities in real-world settings poses a major challenge. To this end, we introduce BEARCUBS, a "small but mighty" benchmark of 111 information-seeking questions designed to evaluate a web agent's ability to search, browse, and identify factual information from the web. Unlike prior web agent benchmarks, solving BEARCUBS requires (1) accessing live web content rather than synthetic or simulated pages, which captures the unpredictability of real-world web interactions; and (2) performing a broad range of multimodal interactions (e.g., video understanding, 3D navigation) that cannot be bypassed via text-based workarounds. Each question in BEARCUBS has a corresponding short, unambiguous answer and a human-validated browsing trajectory, allowing for transparent evaluation of agent performance and strategies. A human study confirms that BEARCUBS questions are solvable but non-trivial (84.7% human accuracy), revealing search inefficiencies and domain knowledge gaps as common failure points. By contrast, state-of-the-art computer-using agents underperform, with the best-scoring system (OpenAI's Operator) reaching only 24.3% accuracy. These results highlight critical areas for improvement, including reliable source selection and more powerful multimodal capabilities. To facilitate future research, BEARCUBS will be updated periodically to replace invalid or contaminated questions, keeping the benchmark fresh for future generations of web agents.</description>

      <title>Learning Gentle Grasping Using Vision, Sound, and Touch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our daily life, we often encounter objects that are fragile and can be damaged by excessive grasping force, such as fruits. For these objects, it is paramount to grasp gently -- not using the maximum amount of force possible, but rather the minimum amount of force necessary. This paper proposes using visual, tactile, and auditory signals to learn to grasp and regrasp objects stably and gently. Specifically, we use audio signals as an indicator of gentleness during the grasping, and then train end-to-end an action-conditional model from raw visuo-tactile inputs that predicts both the stability and the gentleness of future grasping candidates, thus allowing the selection and execution of the most promising action. Experimental results on a multi-fingered hand over 1,500 grasping trials demonstrated that our model is useful for gentle grasping by validating the predictive performance (3.27\% higher accuracy than the vision-only variant) and providing interpretations of their behavior. Finally, real-world experiments confirmed that the grasping performance with the trained multi-modal model outperformed other baselines (17\% higher rate for stable and gentle grasps than vision-only). Our approach requires neither tactile sensor calibration nor analytical force modeling, drastically reducing the engineering effort to grasp fragile objects.

      <title>A Theory of Learning with Autoregressive Chain of Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a given base class of sequence-to-next-token generators, we consider learning prompt-to-answer mappings obtained by iterating a fixed, time-invariant generator for multiple steps, thus generating a chain-of-thought, and then taking the final token as the answer. We formalize the learning problems both when the chain-of-thought is observed and when training only on prompt-answer pairs, with the chain-of-thought latent. We analyze the sample and computational complexity both in terms of general properties of the base class (e.g. its VC dimension) and for specific base classes such as linear thresholds. We present a simple base class that allows for universal representability and computationally tractable chain-of-thought learning. Central to our development is that time invariance allows for sample complexity that is independent of the length of the chain-of-thought. Attention arises naturally in our construction.</description>

      <title>Discriminative versus Generative Approaches to Simulation-based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most of the fundamental, emergent, and phenomenological parameters of particle and nuclear physics are determined through parametric template fits. Simulations are used to populate histograms which are then matched to data. This approach is inherently lossy, since histograms are binned and low-dimensional. Deep learning has enabled unbinned and high-dimensional parameter estimation through neural likelihiood(-ratio) estimation. We compare two approaches for neural simulation-based inference (NSBI): one based on discriminative learning (classification) and one based on generative modeling. These two approaches are directly evaluated on the same datasets, with a similar level of hyperparameter optimization in both cases. In addition to a Gaussian dataset, we study NSBI using a Higgs boson dataset from the FAIR Universe Challenge. We find that both the direct likelihood and likelihood ratio estimation are able to effectively extract parameters with reasonable uncertainties. For the numerical examples and within the set of hyperparameters studied, we found that the likelihood ratio method is more accurate and/or precise. Both methods have a significant spread from the network training and would require ensembling or other mitigation strategies in practice.</description>

      <title>Benign Overfitting and the Geometry of the Ridge Regression Solution in Binary Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the behavior of ridge regression in an overparameterized binary classification task. We assume examples are drawn from (anisotropic) class-conditional cluster distributions with opposing means and we allow for the training labels to have a constant level of label-flipping noise. We characterize the classification error achieved by ridge regression under the assumption that the covariance matrix of the cluster distribution has a high effective rank in the tail. We show that ridge regression has qualitatively different behavior depending on the scale of the cluster mean vector and its interaction with the covariance matrix of the cluster distributions. In regimes where the scale is very large, the conditions that allow for benign overfitting turn out to be the same as those for the regression task. We additionally provide insights into how the introduction of label noise affects the behavior of the minimum norm interpolator (MNI). The optimal classifier in this setting is a linear transformation of the cluster mean vector and in the noiseless setting the MNI approximately learns this transformation. On the other hand, the introduction of label noise can significantly change the geometry of the solution while preserving the same qualitative behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates approximation capabilities of two-dimensional (2D) deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with Korobov functions serving as a benchmark. We focus on 2D CNNs, comprising multi-channel convolutional layers with zero-padding and ReLU activations, followed by a fully connected layer. We propose a fully constructive approach for building 2D CNNs to approximate Korobov functions and provide rigorous analysis of the complexity of the constructed networks. Our results demonstrate that 2D CNNs achieve near-optimal approximation rates under the continuous weight selection model, significantly alleviating the curse of dimensionality. This work provides a solid theoretical foundation for 2D CNNs and illustrates their potential for broader applications in function approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leitmotifs are musical phrases that are reprised in various forms throughout a piece. Due to diverse variations and instrumentation, detecting the occurrence of leitmotifs from audio recordings is a highly challenging task. Leitmotif detection may be handled as a subcategory of audio event detection, where leitmotif activity is predicted at the frame level. However, as leitmotifs embody distinct, coherent musical structures, a more holistic approach akin to bounding box regression in visual object detection can be helpful. This method captures the entirety of a motif rather than fragmenting it into individual frames, thereby preserving its musical integrity and producing more useful predictions. We present our experimental results on tackling leitmotif detection as a boundary regression task.</description>

      <title>Computational bottlenecks for denoising diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Denoising diffusions provide a general strategy to sample from a probability distribution $\mu$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ by constructing a stochastic process $(\hat{\boldsymbol x}_t:t\ge 0)$ in ${\mathbb R}^d$ such that the distribution of $\hat{\boldsymbol x}_T$ at large times $T$ approximates $\mu$. The drift ${\boldsymbol m}:{\mathbb R}^d\times{\mathbb R}\to{\mathbb R}^d$ of this diffusion process is learned from data (samples from $\mu$) by minimizing the so-called score-matching objective. In order for the generating process to be efficient, it must be possible to evaluate (an approximation of) ${\boldsymbol m}({\boldsymbol y},t)$ in polynomial time.
  Is every probability distribution $\mu$, for which sampling is tractable, also amenable to sampling via diffusions? We provide evidence to the contrary by constructing a probability distribution $\mu$ for which sampling is easy, but the drift of the diffusion process is intractable -- under a popular conjecture on information-computation gaps in statistical estimation. We further show that any polynomial-time computable drift can be modified in a way that changes minimally the score matching objective and yet results in incorrect sampling.</description>

Abstract: Flow Matching and Transformer architectures have demonstrated remarkable performance in image generation tasks, with recent work FlowAR [Ren et al., 2024] synergistically integrating both paradigms to advance synthesis fidelity. However, current FlowAR implementations remain constrained by first-order trajectory modeling during the generation process. This paper introduces a novel framework that systematically enhances flow autoregressive transformers through high-order supervision. We provide theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation showing that our High-Order FlowAR (HOFAR) demonstrates measurable improvements in generation quality compared to baseline models. The proposed approach advances the understanding of flow-based autoregressive modeling by introducing a systematic framework for analyzing trajectory dynamics through high-order expansion.</description>

      <title>LongProLIP: A Probabilistic Vision-Language Model with Long Context Text</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Probabilistic Language-Image Pre-Training (ProLIP) has been proposed to tackle the multiplicity issue of vision-language (VL) tasks. Despite their success in probabilistic representation learning at a scale, the ProLIP models cannot handle long context texts longer than 64 context length, which limits their ability to capture rich contextual information from longer text sequences. To address this issue, this paper proposes a fine-tuning strategy for ProLIP to accept longer texts, e.g., 256 text tokens. Experimental results on Urban-1k and the DataComp evaluation suite show that the proposed LongProLIP recipe can improve understanding of long contexts while minimizing the negative effect of fine-tuning. We also observe a trade-off between the long context understanding (measured by Urban-1k) and general zero-shot capability (measured by ImageNet or the average of 38 zero-shot evaluation datasets by DataComp).</description>

      <title>ForceGrip: Data-Free Curriculum Learning for Realistic Grip Force Control in VR Hand Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realistic hand manipulation is a key component of immersive virtual reality (VR), yet existing methods often rely on a kinematic approach or motion-capture datasets that omit crucial physical attributes such as contact forces and finger torques. Consequently, these approaches prioritize tight, one-size-fits-all grips rather than reflecting users' intended force levels. We present ForceGrip, a deep learning agent that synthesizes realistic hand manipulation motions, faithfully reflecting the user's grip force intention. Instead of mimicking predefined motion datasets, ForceGrip uses generated training scenarios-randomizing object shapes, wrist movements, and trigger input flows-to challenge the agent with a broad spectrum of physical interactions. To effectively learn from these complex tasks, we employ a three-phase curriculum learning framework comprising Finger Positioning, Intention Adaptation, and Dynamic Stabilization. This progressive strategy ensures stable hand-object contact, adaptive force control based on user inputs, and robust handling under dynamic conditions. Additionally, a proximity reward function enhances natural finger motions and accelerates training convergence. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal ForceGrip's superior force controllability and plausibility compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Locally Private Nonparametric Contextual Multi-armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by privacy concerns in sequential decision-making on sensitive data, we address the challenge of nonparametric contextual multi-armed bandits (MAB) under local differential privacy (LDP). We develop a uniform-confidence-bound-type estimator, showing its minimax optimality supported by a matching minimax lower bound. We further consider the case where auxiliary datasets are available, subject also to (possibly heterogeneous) LDP constraints. Under the widely-used covariate shift framework, we propose a jump-start scheme to effectively utilize the auxiliary data, the minimax optimality of which is further established by a matching lower bound. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical results and underscore the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Median Consensus Embedding for Dimensionality Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes median consensus embedding (MCE) to address variability in low-dimensional embeddings caused by random initialization in dimensionality reduction techniques such as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. MCE is defined as the geometric median of multiple embeddings. By assuming multiple embeddings as independent and identically distributed random samples and applying large deviation theory, we prove that MCE achieves consistency at an exponential rate. Furthermore, we develop a practical algorithm to implement MCE by constructing a distance function between embeddings based on the Frobenius norm of the pairwise distance matrix of data points. Application to real-world data demonstrates that MCE converges rapidly and significantly reduces instability. These results confirm that MCE effectively mitigates random initialization issues in embedding methods.</description>

      <title>Functional Unit: A New Perspective on Materials Science Research Paradigms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New materials have long marked the civilization level, serving as an impetus for technological progress and societal transformation. The classic structure-property correlations were key of materials science and engineering. However, the knowledge of materials faces significant challenges in adapting to exclusively data-driven approaches for new material discovery. This perspective introduces the concepts of functional units (FUs) to fill the gap in understanding of material structure-property correlations and knowledge inheritance as the "composition-microstructure" paradigm transitions to a data-driven AI paradigm transitions. Firstly, we provide a bird's-eye view of the research paradigm evolution from early "process-structure-properties-performance" to contemporary data-driven AI new trend. Next, we highlight recent advancements in the characterization of functional units across diverse material systems, emphasizing their critical role in multiscale material design. Finally, we discuss the integration of functional units into the new AI-driven paradigm of materials science, addressing both opportunities and challenges in computational materials innovation.</description>

      <title>Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace: Fine-grained Face Understanding and Generation with Unified Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm in foundational computer vision research, demonstrating significant potential in both image understanding and generation. However, existing research in the face domain primarily focuses on $\textbf{coarse}$ facial attribute understanding, with limited capacity to handle $\textbf{fine-grained}$ facial attributes and without addressing generation capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace, the first UMM tailored specifically for fine-grained face understanding and generation. In general, we train Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace on a self-constructed, specialized dataset utilizing two mutually beneficial diffusion techniques and a two-level mixture-of-experts architecture. Specifically, we first build a large-scale facial dataset, Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace-130K, which contains 130K image-text pairs with one million question-answering pairs that span a wide range of facial attributes. Second, we establish a theoretical connection between discrete diffusion score matching and masked generative models, optimizing both evidence lower bounds simultaneously, which significantly improves the model's ability to synthesize facial details. Finally, we introduce both token-level and sequence-level mixture-of-experts, enabling efficient fine-grained representation learning for both understanding and generation tasks. Extensive experiments on Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace-130K demonstrate that Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace outperforms existing UMMs and generative models, achieving superior performance across both understanding and generation tasks.</description>

      <title>FlowDPS: Flow-Driven Posterior Sampling for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow matching is a recent state-of-the-art framework for generative modeling based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs). While closely related to diffusion models, it provides a more general perspective on generative modeling. Although inverse problem solving has been extensively explored using diffusion models, it has not been rigorously examined within the broader context of flow models. Therefore, here we extend the diffusion inverse solvers (DIS) - which perform posterior sampling by combining a denoising diffusion prior with an likelihood gradient - into the flow framework. Specifically, by driving the flow-version of Tweedie's formula, we decompose the flow ODE into two components: one for clean image estimation and the other for noise estimation. By integrating the likelihood gradient and stochastic noise into each component, respectively, we demonstrate that posterior sampling for inverse problem solving can be effectively achieved using flows. Our proposed solver, Flow-Driven Posterior Sampling (FlowDPS), can also be seamlessly integrated into a latent flow model with a transformer architecture. Across four linear inverse problems, we confirm that FlowDPS outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, all without requiring additional training.</description>

      <title>Towards Large-scale Chemical Reaction Image Parsing via a Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant promise in advancing organic chemistry research; however, its effectiveness depends on the availability of high-quality chemical reaction data. Currently, most published chemical reactions are not available in machine-readable form, limiting the broader application of AI in this field. The extraction of published chemical reactions into structured databases still relies heavily on manual curation, and robust automatic parsing of chemical reaction images into machine-readable data remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce the Reaction Image Multimodal large language model (RxnIM), the first multimodal large language model specifically designed to parse chemical reaction images into machine-readable reaction data. RxnIM not only extracts key chemical components from reaction images but also interprets the textual content that describes reaction conditions. Together with specially designed large-scale dataset generation method to support model training, our approach achieves excellent performance, with an average F1 score of 88% on various benchmarks, surpassing literature methods by 5%. This represents a crucial step toward the automatic construction of large databases of machine-readable reaction data parsed from images in the chemistry literature, providing essential data resources for AI research in chemistry. The source code, model checkpoints, and datasets developed in this work are released under permissive licenses. An instance of the RxnIM web application can be accessed at https://huggingface.co/spaces/CYF200127/RxnIM.</description>

      <title>Automating Violence Detection and Categorization from Ancient Texts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Violence descriptions in literature offer valuable insights for a wide range of research in the humanities. For historians, depictions of violence are of special interest for analyzing the societal dynamics surrounding large wars and individual conflicts of influential people. Harvesting data for violence research manually is laborious and time-consuming. This study is the first one to evaluate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in identifying violence in ancient texts and categorizing it across multiple dimensions. Our experiments identify LLMs as a valuable tool to scale up the accurate analysis of historical texts and show the effect of fine-tuning and data augmentation, yielding an F1-score of up to 0.93 for violence detection and 0.86 for fine-grained violence categorization.</description>

      <title>A Cascading Cooperative Multi-agent Framework for On-ramp Merging Control Integrating Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from replicating human-like behaviors, generalizing effectively in multi-agent scenarios, and overcoming inherent interpretability issues.These tasks are compounded when deep environment understanding, agent coordination and dynamic optimization are required. While Large Language Model (LLM) enhanced methods have shown promise in generalization and interoperability, they often neglect necessary multi-agent coordination. Therefore, we introduce the Cascading Cooperative Multi-agent (CCMA) framework, integrating RL for individual interactions, a fine-tuned LLM for regional cooperation, a reward function for global optimization, and the Retrieval-augmented Generation mechanism to dynamically optimize decision-making across complex driving scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that the CCMA outperforms existing RL methods, demonstrating significant improvements in both micro and macro-level performance in complex driving environments.</description>

      <title>To Use or Not to Use a Universal Force Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing scientific research, particularly in computational materials science, by enabling more accurate and efficient simulations. Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as powerful tools for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, potentially offering quantum-mechanical accuracy with the efficiency of classical MD. This Perspective evaluates the viability of universal MLFFs for simulating complex materials systems from the standpoint of a potential practitioner. Using the temperature-driven ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition of PbTiO$_3$ as a benchmark, we assess leading universal force fields, including CHGNet, MACE, M3GNet, and GPTFF, alongside specialized models like UniPero. While universal MLFFs trained on PBE-derived datasets perform well in predicting equilibrium properties, they largely fail to capture realistic finite-temperature phase transitions under constant-pressure MD, often exhibiting unphysical instabilities. These shortcomings stem from inherited biases in exchange-correlation functionals and limited generalization to anharmonic interactions governing dynamic behavior. However, fine-tuning universal models or employing system-specific MLFFs like UniPero successfully restores predictive accuracy. We advocates for hybrid approaches combining universal pretraining with targeted optimization, improved error quantification frameworks, and community-driven benchmarks to advance MLFFs as robust tools for computational materials discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss necessary conditions for a PAC-Bayes bound to provide a meaningful generalisation guarantee. Our analysis reveals that the optimal generalisation guarantee depends solely on the distribution of the risk induced by the prior distribution. In particular, achieving a target generalisation level is only achievable if the prior places sufficient mass on high-performing predictors. We relate these requirements to the prevalent practice of using data-dependent priors in deep learning PAC-Bayes applications, and discuss the implications for the claim that PAC-Bayes ``explains'' generalisation.</description>

      <title>HASARD: A Benchmark for Vision-Based Safe Reinforcement Learning in Embodied Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancing safe autonomous systems through reinforcement learning (RL) requires robust benchmarks to evaluate performance, analyze methods, and assess agent competencies. Humans primarily rely on embodied visual perception to safely navigate and interact with their surroundings, making it a valuable capability for RL agents. However, existing vision-based 3D benchmarks only consider simple navigation tasks. To address this shortcoming, we introduce \textbf{HASARD}, a suite of diverse and complex tasks to $\textbf{HA}$rness $\textbf{SA}$fe $\textbf{R}$L with $\textbf{D}$oom, requiring strategic decision-making, comprehending spatial relationships, and predicting the short-term future. HASARD features three difficulty levels and two action spaces. An empirical evaluation of popular baseline methods demonstrates the benchmark's complexity, unique challenges, and reward-cost trade-offs. Visualizing agent navigation during training with top-down heatmaps provides insight into a method's learning process. Incrementally training across difficulty levels offers an implicit learning curriculum. HASARD is the first safe RL benchmark to exclusively target egocentric vision-based learning, offering a cost-effective and insightful way to explore the potential and boundaries of current and future safe RL methods. The environments and baseline implementations are open-sourced at https://sites.google.com/view/hasard-bench/.</description>

      <title>Aligning Text to Image in Diffusion Models is Easier Than You Think</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While recent advancements in generative modeling have significantly improved text-image alignment, some residual misalignment between text and image representations still remains. Although many approaches have attempted to address this issue by fine-tuning models using various reward models, etc., we revisit the challenge from the perspective of representation alignment-an approach that has gained popularity with the success of REPresentation Alignment (REPA). We first argue that conventional text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, typically trained on paired image and text data (i.e., positive pairs) by minimizing score matching or flow matching losses, is suboptimal from the standpoint of representation alignment. Instead, a better alignment can be achieved through contrastive learning that leverages both positive and negative pairs. To achieve this efficiently even with pretrained models, we introduce a lightweight contrastive fine tuning strategy called SoftREPA that uses soft text tokens. This approach improves alignment with minimal computational overhead by adding fewer than 1M trainable parameters to the pretrained model. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method explicitly increases the mutual information between text and image representations, leading to enhanced semantic consistency. Experimental results across text-to-image generation and text-guided image editing tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the semantic consistency of T2I generative models.</description>

      <title>MT-NAM: An Efficient and Adaptive Model for Epileptic Seizure Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning algorithms employed in neural interface systems is crucial for advancing next-generation intelligent therapeutic devices. However, current systems often utilize basic machine learning models that do not fully exploit the natural structure of brain signals. Additionally, existing learning models used for neural signal processing often demonstrate low speed and efficiency during inference. To address these challenges, this study introduces Micro Tree-based NAM (MT-NAM), a distilled model based on the recently proposed Neural Additive Models (NAM). The MT-NAM achieves a remarkable 100$\times$ improvement in inference speed compared to standard NAM, without compromising accuracy. We evaluate our approach on the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset, which includes recordings from 24 patients with varying numbers of sessions and seizures. NAM achieves an 85.3\% window-based sensitivity and 95\% specificity. Interestingly, our proposed MT-NAM shows only a 2\% reduction in sensitivity compared to the original NAM. To regain this sensitivity, we utilize a test-time template adjuster (T3A) as an update mechanism, enabling our model to achieve higher sensitivity during test time by accommodating transient shifts in neural signals. With this online update approach, MT-NAM achieves the same sensitivity as the standard NAM while achieving approximately 50$\times$ acceleration in inference speed.</description>

      <title>Massively Parallel Expectation Maximization For Approximate Posteriors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference for hierarchical models can be very challenging. MCMC methods have difficulty scaling to large models with many observations and latent variables. While variational inference (VI) and reweighted wake-sleep (RWS) can be more scalable, they are gradient-based methods and so often require many iterations to converge. Our key insight was that modern massively parallel importance weighting methods (Bowyer et al., 2024) give fast and accurate posterior moment estimates, and we can use these moment estimates to rapidly learn an approximate posterior. Specifically, we propose using expectation maximization to fit the approximate posterior, which we call QEM. The expectation step involves computing the posterior moments using high-quality massively parallel estimates from Bowyer et al. (2024). The maximization step involves fitting the approximate posterior using these moments, which can be done straightforwardly for simple approximate posteriors such as Gaussian, Gamma, Beta, Dirichlet, Binomial, Multinomial, Categorical, etc. (or combinations thereof). We show that QEM is faster than state-of-the-art, massively parallel variants of RWS and VI, and is invariant to reparameterizations of the model that dramatically slow down gradient based methods.</description>

      <title>A systematic literature review of unsupervised learning algorithms for anomalous traffic detection based on flows</title>

Abstract: The constant increase of devices connected to the Internet, and therefore of cyber-attacks, makes it necessary to analyze network traffic in order to recognize malicious activity. Traditional packet-based analysis methods are insufficient because in large networks the amount of traffic is so high that it is unfeasible to review all communications. For this reason, flows is a suitable approach for this situation, which in future 5G networks will have to be used, as the number of packets will increase dramatically. If this is also combined with unsupervised learning models, it can detect new threats for which it has not been trained. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature on unsupervised learning algorithms for detecting anomalies in network flows, following the PRISMA guideline. A total of 63 scientific articles have been reviewed, analyzing 13 of them in depth. The results obtained show that autoencoder is the most used option, followed by SVM, ALAD, or SOM. On the other hand, all the datasets used for anomaly detection have been collected, including some specialised in IoT or with real data collected from honeypots.</description>

      <title>Energy Scale Degradation in Sparse Quantum Solvers: A Barrier to Quantum Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers a promising route for tackling hard optimization problems by encoding them as Ising models. However, sparse qubit connectivity requires the use of minor-embedding, mapping logical qubits onto chains of physical qubits, which necessitates stronger intra-chain coupling to maintain consistency. This elevated coupling strength forces a rescaling of the Hamiltonian due to hardware-imposed limits on the allowable ranges of coupling strengths, reducing the energy gaps between competing states, thus, degrading the solver's performance. Here, we introduce a theoretical model that quantifies this degradation. We show that as the connectivity degree increases, the effective temperature rises as a polynomial function, resulting in a success probability that decays exponentially. Our analysis further establishes worst-case bounds on the energy scale degradation based on the inverse conductance of chain subgraphs, revealing two most important drivers of chain strength, \textit{chain volume} and \textit{chain connectivity}. Our findings indicate that achieving quantum advantage is inherently challenging. Experiments on D-Wave quantum annealers validate these findings, highlighting the need for hardware with improved connectivity and optimized scale-aware embedding algorithms.</description>

      <title>Reasoning in visual navigation of end-to-end trained agents: a dynamical systems approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Progress in Embodied AI has made it possible for end-to-end-trained agents to navigate in photo-realistic environments with high-level reasoning and zero-shot or language-conditioned behavior, but benchmarks are still dominated by simulation. In this work, we focus on the fine-grained behavior of fast-moving real robots and present a large-scale experimental study involving \numepisodes{} navigation episodes in a real environment with a physical robot, where we analyze the type of reasoning emerging from end-to-end training. In particular, we study the presence of realistic dynamics which the agent learned for open-loop forecasting, and their interplay with sensing. We analyze the way the agent uses latent memory to hold elements of the scene structure and information gathered during exploration. We probe the planning capabilities of the agent, and find in its memory evidence for somewhat precise plans over a limited horizon. Furthermore, we show in a post-hoc analysis that the value function learned by the agent relates to long-term planning. Put together, our experiments paint a new picture on how using tools from computer vision and sequential decision making have led to new capabilities in robotics and control. An interactive tool is available at europe.naverlabs.com/research/publications/reasoning-in-visual-navigation-of-end-to-end-trained-agents.</description>

      <title>Mind the Memory Gap: Unveiling GPU Bottlenecks in Large-Batch LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models have been widely adopted across different tasks, but their auto-regressive generation nature often leads to inefficient resource utilization during inference. While batching is commonly used to increase throughput, performance gains plateau beyond a certain batch size, especially with smaller models, a phenomenon that existing literature typically explains as a shift to the compute-bound regime. In this paper, through an in-depth GPU-level analysis, we reveal that large-batch inference remains memory-bound, with most GPU compute capabilities underutilized due to DRAM bandwidth saturation as the primary bottleneck. To address this, we propose a Batching Configuration Advisor (BCA) that optimizes memory allocation, reducing GPU memory requirements with minimal impact on throughput. The freed memory and underutilized GPU compute capabilities can then be leveraged by concurrent workloads. Specifically, we use model replication to improve serving throughput and GPU utilization. Our findings challenge conventional assumptions about LLM inference, offering new insights and practical strategies for improving resource utilization, particularly for smaller language models.</description>

      <title>Gait in Eight: Efficient On-Robot Learning for Omnidirectional Quadruped Locomotion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-robot Reinforcement Learning is a promising approach to train embodiment-aware policies for legged robots. However, the computational constraints of real-time learning on robots pose a significant challenge. We present a framework for efficiently learning quadruped locomotion in just 8 minutes of raw real-time training utilizing the sample efficiency and minimal computational overhead of the new off-policy algorithm CrossQ. We investigate two control architectures: Predicting joint target positions for agile, high-speed locomotion and Central Pattern Generators for stable, natural gaits. While prior work focused on learning simple forward gaits, our framework extends on-robot learning to omnidirectional locomotion. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach in different indoor and outdoor environments.</description>

      <title>($\boldsymbol{\theta}_l, \boldsymbol{\theta}_u$)-Parametric Multi-Task Optimization: Joint Search in Solution and Infinite Task Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-task optimization is typically characterized by a fixed and finite set of optimization tasks. The present paper relaxes this condition by considering a non-fixed and potentially infinite set of optimization tasks defined in a parameterized, continuous and bounded task space. We refer to this unique problem setting as parametric multi-task optimization (PMTO). Assuming the bounds of the task parameters to be ($\boldsymbol{\theta}_l$, $\boldsymbol{\theta}_u$), a novel ($\boldsymbol{\theta}_l$, $\boldsymbol{\theta}_u$)-PMTO algorithm is crafted to enable joint search over tasks and their solutions. This joint search is supported by two approximation models: (1) for mapping solutions to the objective spaces of all tasks, which provably accelerates convergence by acting as a conduit for inter-task knowledge transfers, and (2) for probabilistically mapping tasks to the solution space, which facilitates evolutionary exploration of under-explored regions of the task space. At the end of a full ($\boldsymbol{\theta}_l$, $\boldsymbol{\theta}_u$)-PMTO run, the acquired models enable rapid identification of optimized solutions for any task lying within the specified bounds. This outcome is validated on both synthetic test problems and practical case studies, with the significant real-world applicability of PMTO shown towards fast reconfiguration of robot controllers under changing task conditions. The potential of PMTO to vastly speedup the search for solutions to minimax optimization problems is also demonstrated through an example in robust engineering design.</description>

      <title>AnyMoLe: Any Character Motion In-betweening Leveraging Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in learning-based motion in-betweening, a key limitation has been overlooked: the requirement for character-specific datasets. In this work, we introduce AnyMoLe, a novel method that addresses this limitation by leveraging video diffusion models to generate motion in-between frames for arbitrary characters without external data. Our approach employs a two-stage frame generation process to enhance contextual understanding. Furthermore, to bridge the domain gap between real-world and rendered character animations, we introduce ICAdapt, a fine-tuning technique for video diffusion models. Additionally, we propose a ``motion-video mimicking'' optimization technique, enabling seamless motion generation for characters with arbitrary joint structures using 2D and 3D-aware features. AnyMoLe significantly reduces data dependency while generating smooth and realistic transitions, making it applicable to a wide range of motion in-betweening tasks.</description>

      <title>Generalizable and Explainable Deep Learning for Medical Image Computing: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective. This paper presents an overview of generalizable and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in deep learning (DL) for medical imaging, aimed at addressing the urgent need for transparency and explainability in clinical applications.
  Methodology. We propose to use four CNNs in three medical datasets (brain tumor, skin cancer, and chest x-ray) for medical image classification tasks. In addition, we perform paired t-tests to show the significance of the differences observed between different methods. Furthermore, we propose to combine ResNet50 with five common XAI techniques to obtain explainable results for model prediction, aiming at improving model transparency. We also involve a quantitative metric (confidence increase) to evaluate the usefulness of XAI techniques.
  Key findings. The experimental results indicate that ResNet50 can achieve feasible accuracy and F1 score in all datasets (e.g., 86.31\% accuracy in skin cancer). Furthermore, the findings show that while certain XAI methods, such as XgradCAM, effectively highlight relevant abnormal regions in medical images, others, like EigenGradCAM, may perform less effectively in specific scenarios. In addition, XgradCAM indicates higher confidence increase (e.g., 0.12 in glioma tumor) compared to GradCAM++ (0.09) and LayerCAM (0.08).
  Implications. Based on the experimental results and recent advancements, we outline future research directions to enhance the robustness and generalizability of DL models in the field of biomedical imaging.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Distributed Optimization with Compression and Error Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning tasks often involve massive datasets and models, necessitating distributed optimization algorithms with reduced communication overhead. Communication compression, where clients transmit compressed updates to a central server, has emerged as a key technique to mitigate communication bottlenecks. However, the theoretical understanding of stochastic distributed optimization with contractive compression remains limited, particularly in conjunction with Nesterov acceleration -- a cornerstone for achieving faster convergence in optimization.
  In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, ADEF (Accelerated Distributed Error Feedback), which integrates Nesterov acceleration, contractive compression, error feedback, and gradient difference compression. We prove that ADEF achieves the first accelerated convergence rate for stochastic distributed optimization with contractive compression in the general convex regime. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical efficacy of ADEF in reducing communication costs while maintaining fast convergence.</description>

      <title>MinGRU-Based Encoder for Turbo Autoencoder Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early neural channel coding approaches leveraged dense neural networks with one-hot encodings to design adaptive encoder-decoder pairs, improving block error rate (BLER) and automating the design process. However, these methods struggled with scalability as the size of message sets and block lengths increased. TurboAE addressed this challenge by focusing on bit-sequence inputs rather than symbol-level representations, transforming the scalability issue associated with large message sets into a sequence modeling problem. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs) were a natural fit for sequence processing, their reliance on sequential computations made them computationally expensive and inefficient for long sequences. As a result, TurboAE adopted convolutional network blocks, which were faster to train and more scalable, but lacked the sequential modeling advantages of RNNs. Recent advances in efficient RNN architectures, such as minGRU and minLSTM, and structured state space models (SSMs) like S4 and S6, overcome these limitations by significantly reducing memory and computational overhead. These models enable scalable sequence processing, making RNNs competitive for long-sequence tasks. In this work, we revisit RNNs for Turbo autoencoders by integrating the lightweight minGRU model with a Mamba block from SSMs into a parallel Turbo autoencoder framework. Our results demonstrate that this hybrid design matches the performance of convolutional network-based Turbo autoencoder approaches for short sequences while significantly improving scalability and training efficiency for long block lengths. This highlights the potential of efficient RNNs in advancing neural channel coding for long-sequence scenarios.</description>

      <title>Controlling Latent Diffusion Using Latent CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instead of performing text-conditioned denoising in the image domain, latent diffusion models (LDMs) operate in latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE), enabling more efficient processing at reduced computational costs. However, while the diffusion process has moved to the latent space, the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) models, as used in many image processing tasks, still operate in pixel space. Doing so requires costly VAE-decoding of latent images before they can be processed. In this paper, we introduce Latent-CLIP, a CLIP model that operates directly in the latent space. We train Latent-CLIP on 2.7B pairs of latent images and descriptive texts, and show that it matches zero-shot classification performance of similarly sized CLIP models on both the ImageNet benchmark and a LDM-generated version of it, demonstrating its effectiveness in assessing both real and generated content. Furthermore, we construct Latent-CLIP rewards for reward-based noise optimization (ReNO) and show that they match the performance of their CLIP counterparts on GenEval and T2I-CompBench while cutting the cost of the total pipeline by 21%. Finally, we use Latent-CLIP to guide generation away from harmful content, achieving strong performance on the inappropriate image prompts (I2P) benchmark and a custom evaluation, without ever requiring the costly step of decoding intermediate images.</description>

      <title>Data Driven Decision Making with Time Series and Spatio-temporal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series data captures properties that change over time. Such data occurs widely, ranging from the scientific and medical domains to the industrial and environmental domains. When the properties in time series exhibit spatial variations, we often call the data spatio-temporal. As part of the continued digitalization of processes throughout society, increasingly large volumes of time series and spatio-temporal data are available. In this tutorial, we focus on data-driven decision making with such data, e.g., enabling greener and more efficient transportation based on traffic time series forecasting. The tutorial adopts the holistic paradigm of "data-governance-analytics-decision." We first introduce the data foundation of time series and spatio-temporal data, which is often heterogeneous. Next, we discuss data governance methods that aim to improve data quality. We then cover data analytics, focusing on five desired characteristics: automation, robustness, generality, explainability, and resource efficiency. We finally cover data-driven decision making strategies and briefly discuss promising research directions. We hope that the tutorial will serve as a primary resource for researchers and practitioners who are interested in value creation from time series and spatio-temporal data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion planning failures during autonomous navigation often occur when safety constraints are either too conservative, leading to deadlocks, or too liberal, resulting in collisions. To improve robustness, a robot must dynamically adapt its safety constraints to ensure it reaches its goal while balancing safety and performance measures. To this end, we propose a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based policy for adapting Control Barrier Function (CBF) constraint parameters at runtime, ensuring safe yet non-conservative motion. The proposed approach is designed for a general high-level motion planner, low-level controller, and target system model, and is trained in simulation only. Through extensive simulations and physical experiments, we demonstrate that our framework effectively adapts CBF constraints, enabling the robot to reach its final goal without compromising safety.</description>

      <title>External Knowledge Injection for CLIP-Based Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) enables learning systems to continuously adapt to evolving data streams. With the advancement of pre-training, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) offers a promising starting point for CIL. However, CLIP makes decisions by matching visual embeddings to class names, overlooking the rich contextual information conveyed through language. For instance, the concept of ``cat'' can be decomposed into features like tail, fur, and face for recognition. Besides, since the model is continually updated, these detailed features are overwritten in CIL, requiring external knowledge for compensation. In this paper, we introduce ExterNal knowledGe INjEction (ENGINE) for CLIP-based CIL. To enhance knowledge transfer from outside the dataset, we propose a dual-branch injection tuning framework that encodes informative knowledge from both visual and textual modalities. The visual branch is enhanced with data augmentation to enrich the visual features, while the textual branch leverages GPT-4 to rewrite discriminative descriptors. In addition to this on-the-fly knowledge injection, we also implement post-tuning knowledge by re-ranking the prediction results during inference. With the injected knowledge, the model can better capture informative features for downstream tasks as data evolves. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ENGINE.

      <title>ChromaFormer: A Scalable and Accurate Transformer Architecture for Land Cover Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing imagery from systems such as Sentinel provides full coverage of the Earth's surface at around 10-meter resolution. The remote sensing community has transitioned to extensive use of deep learning models due to their high performance on benchmarks such as the UCMerced and ISPRS Vaihingen datasets. Convolutional models such as UNet and ResNet variations are commonly employed for remote sensing but typically only accept three channels, as they were developed for RGB imagery, while satellite systems provide more than ten. Recently, several transformer architectures have been proposed for remote sensing, but they have not been extensively benchmarked and are typically used on small datasets such as Salinas Valley. Meanwhile, it is becoming feasible to obtain dense spatial land-use labels for entire first-level administrative divisions of some countries. Scaling law observations suggest that substantially larger multi-spectral transformer models could provide a significant leap in remote sensing performance in these settings.
  In this work, we propose ChromaFormer, a family of multi-spectral transformer models, which we evaluate across orders of magnitude differences in model parameters to assess their performance and scaling effectiveness on a densely labeled imagery dataset of Flanders, Belgium, covering more than 13,500 km^2 and containing 15 classes. We propose a novel multi-spectral attention strategy and demonstrate its effectiveness through ablations. Furthermore, we show that models many orders of magnitude larger than conventional architectures, such as UNet, lead to substantial accuracy improvements: a UNet++ model with 23M parameters achieves less than 65% accuracy, while a multi-spectral transformer with 655M parameters achieves over 95% accuracy on the Biological Valuation Map of Flanders.</description>

      <title>Can We Detect Failures Without Failure Data? Uncertainty-Aware Runtime Failure Detection for Imitation Learning Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed impressive robotic manipulation systems driven by advances in imitation learning and generative modeling, such as diffusion- and flow-based approaches. As robot policy performance increases, so does the complexity and time horizon of achievable tasks, inducing unexpected and diverse failure modes that are difficult to predict a priori. To enable trustworthy policy deployment in safety-critical human environments, reliable runtime failure detection becomes important during policy inference. However, most existing failure detection approaches rely on prior knowledge of failure modes and require failure data during training, which imposes a significant challenge in practicality and scalability. In response to these limitations, we present FAIL-Detect, a modular two-stage approach for failure detection in imitation learning-based robotic manipulation. To accurately identify failures from successful training data alone, we frame the problem as sequential out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We first distill policy inputs and outputs into scalar signals that correlate with policy failures and capture epistemic uncertainty. FAIL-Detect then employs conformal prediction (CP) as a versatile framework for uncertainty quantification with statistical guarantees. Empirically, we thoroughly investigate both learned and post-hoc scalar signal candidates on diverse robotic manipulation tasks. Our experiments show learned signals to be mostly consistently effective, particularly when using our novel flow-based density estimator. Furthermore, our method detects failures more accurately and faster than state-of-the-art (SOTA) failure detection baselines. These results highlight the potential of FAIL-Detect to enhance the safety and reliability of imitation learning-based robotic systems as they progress toward real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>DeepReview: Improving LLM-based Paper Review with Human-like Deep Thinking Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in scientific research assessment, particularly in automated paper review. However, existing LLM-based review systems face significant challenges, including limited domain expertise, hallucinated reasoning, and a lack of structured evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce DeepReview, a multi-stage framework designed to emulate expert reviewers by incorporating structured analysis, literature retrieval, and evidence-based argumentation. Using DeepReview-13K, a curated dataset with structured annotations, we train DeepReviewer-14B, which outperforms CycleReviewer-70B with fewer tokens. In its best mode, DeepReviewer-14B achieves win rates of 88.21\% and 80.20\% against GPT-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 in evaluations. Our work sets a new benchmark for LLM-based paper review, with all resources publicly available. The code, model, dataset and demo have be released in http://ai-researcher.net.</description>

      <title>Sparsity-Induced Global Matrix Autoregressive Model with Auxiliary Network Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jointly modeling and forecasting economic and financial variables across a large set of countries has long been a significant challenge. Two primary approaches have been utilized to address this issue: the vector autoregressive model with exogenous variables (VARX) and the matrix autoregression (MAR). The VARX model captures domestic dependencies, but treats variables exogenous to represent global factors driven by international trade. In contrast, the MAR model simultaneously considers variables from multiple countries but ignores the trade network. In this paper, we propose an extension of the MAR model that achieves these two aims at once, i.e., studying both international dependencies and the impact of the trade network on the global economy. Additionally, we introduce a sparse component to the model to differentiate between systematic and idiosyncratic cross-predictability. To estimate the model parameters, we propose both a likelihood estimation method and a bias-corrected alternating minimization version. We provide theoretical and empirical analyses of the model's properties, alongside presenting intriguing economic insights derived from our findings.</description>

      <title>BiasEdit: Debiasing Stereotyped Language Models via Model Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have established that language models manifest stereotyped biases. Existing debiasing strategies, such as retraining a model with counterfactual data, representation projection, and prompting often fail to efficiently eliminate bias or directly alter the models' biased internal representations. To address these issues, we propose BiasEdit, an efficient model editing method to remove stereotypical bias from language models through lightweight networks that act as editors to generate parameter updates. BiasEdit employs a debiasing loss guiding editor networks to conduct local edits on partial parameters of a language model for debiasing while preserving the language modeling abilities during editing through a retention loss. Experiments on StereoSet and Crows-Pairs demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of BiasEdit in eliminating bias compared to tangental debiasing baselines and little to no impact on the language models' general capabilities. In addition, we conduct bias tracing to probe bias in various modules and explore bias editing impacts on different components of language models.</description>

      <title>3D Point Cloud Generation via Autoregressive Up-sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a pioneering autoregressive generative model for 3D point cloud generation. Inspired by visual autoregressive modeling (VAR), we conceptualize point cloud generation as an autoregressive up-sampling process. This leads to our novel model, PointARU, which progressively refines 3D point clouds from coarse to fine scales. PointARU follows a two-stage training paradigm: first, it learns multi-scale discrete representations of point clouds, and then it trains an autoregressive transformer for next-scale prediction. To address the inherent unordered and irregular structure of point clouds, we incorporate specialized point-based up-sampling network modules in both stages and integrate 3D absolute positional encoding based on the decoded point cloud at each scale during the second stage. Our model surpasses state-of-the-art (SoTA) diffusion-based approaches in both generation quality and parameter efficiency across diverse experimental settings, marking a new milestone for autoregressive methods in 3D point cloud generation. Furthermore, PointARU demonstrates exceptional performance in completing partial 3D shapes and up-sampling sparse point clouds, outperforming existing generative models in these tasks.</description>

      <title>Tuning-Free Multi-Event Long Video Generation via Synchronized Coupled Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While recent advancements in text-to-video diffusion models enable high-quality short video generation from a single prompt, generating real-world long videos in a single pass remains challenging due to limited data and high computational costs. To address this, several works propose tuning-free approaches, i.e., extending existing models for long video generation, specifically using multiple prompts to allow for dynamic and controlled content changes. However, these methods primarily focus on ensuring smooth transitions between adjacent frames, often leading to content drift and a gradual loss of semantic coherence over longer sequences. To tackle such an issue, we propose Synchronized Coupled Sampling (SynCoS), a novel inference framework that synchronizes denoising paths across the entire video, ensuring long-range consistency across both adjacent and distant frames. Our approach combines two complementary sampling strategies: reverse and optimization-based sampling, which ensure seamless local transitions and enforce global coherence, respectively. However, directly alternating between these samplings misaligns denoising trajectories, disrupting prompt guidance and introducing unintended content changes as they operate independently. To resolve this, SynCoS synchronizes them through a grounded timestep and a fixed baseline noise, ensuring fully coupled sampling with aligned denoising paths. Extensive experiments show that SynCoS significantly improves multi-event long video generation, achieving smoother transitions and superior long-range coherence, outperforming previous approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical autoregressive neural networks in three-dimensional statistical system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive Neural Networks (ANN) have been recently proposed as a mechanism to improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo algorithms for several spin systems. The idea relies on the fact that the total probability of a configuration can be factorized into conditional probabilities of each spin, which in turn can be approximated by a neural network. Once trained, the ANNs can be used to sample configurations from the approximated probability distribution and to evaluate explicitly this probability for a given configuration. It has also been observed that such conditional probabilities give access to information-theoretic observables such as mutual information or entanglement entropy. So far, these methods have been applied to two-dimensional statistical systems or one-dimensional quantum systems. In this paper, we describe a generalization of the hierarchical algorithm to three spatial dimensions and study its performance on the example of the Ising model. We discuss the efficiency of the training and also describe the scaling with the system's dimensionality by comparing results for two- and three-dimensional Ising models with the same number of spins. Finally, we provide estimates of thermodynamical observables for the three-dimensional Ising model, such as the entropy and free energy in a range of temperatures across the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Diffusion Model in High Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Curse of Dimensionality is an unavoidable challenge in statistical probability models, yet diffusion models seem to overcome this limitation, achieving impressive results in high-dimensional data generation. Diffusion models assume that they can learn the statistical properties of the underlying probability distribution, enabling sampling from this distribution to generate realistic samples. But is this really how they work? To address this question, this paper conducts a detailed analysis of the objective function and inference methods of diffusion models, leading to several important conclusions that help answer the above question: 1) In high-dimensional sparse scenarios, the target of the objective function fitting degrades from a weighted sum of multiple samples to a single sample. 2) The mainstream inference methods can all be represented within a simple unified framework, without requiring statistical concepts such as Markov chains and SDEs. 3) Guided by this simple framework, more efficient inference methods can be discovered.</description>

      <title>REGEN: Learning Compact Video Embedding with (Re-)Generative Decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel perspective on learning video embedders for generative modeling: rather than requiring an exact reproduction of an input video, an effective embedder should focus on synthesizing visually plausible reconstructions. This relaxed criterion enables substantial improvements in compression ratios without compromising the quality of downstream generative models. Specifically, we propose replacing the conventional encoder-decoder video embedder with an encoder-generator framework that employs a diffusion transformer (DiT) to synthesize missing details from a compact latent space. Therein, we develop a dedicated latent conditioning module to condition the DiT decoder on the encoded video latent embedding. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach enables superior encoding-decoding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the compression ratio increases. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we report results from our video embedders achieving a temporal compression ratio of up to 32x (8x higher than leading video embedders) and validate the robustness of this ultra-compact latent space for text-to-video generation, providing a significant efficiency boost in latent diffusion model training and inference.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Thought Reasoning In The Wild Is Not Always Faithful</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced state-of-the-art AI capabilities. However, recent studies have shown that CoT reasoning is not always faithful, i.e. CoT reasoning does not always reflect how models arrive at conclusions. So far, most of these studies have focused on unfaithfulness in unnatural contexts where an explicit bias has been introduced. In contrast, we show that unfaithful CoT can occur on realistic prompts with no artificial bias. Our results reveal concerning rates of several forms of unfaithful reasoning in frontier models: Sonnet 3.7 (30.6%), DeepSeek R1 (15.8%) and ChatGPT-4o (12.6%) all answer a high proportion of question pairs unfaithfully. Specifically, we find that models rationalize their implicit biases in answers to binary questions ("implicit post-hoc rationalization"). For example, when separately presented with the questions "Is X bigger than Y?" and "Is Y bigger than X?", models sometimes produce superficially coherent arguments to justify answering Yes to both questions or No to both questions, despite such responses being logically contradictory. We also investigate restoration errors (Dziri et al., 2023), where models make and then silently correct errors in their reasoning, and unfaithful shortcuts, where models use clearly illogical reasoning to simplify solving problems in Putnam questions (a hard benchmark). Our findings raise challenges for AI safety work that relies on monitoring CoT to detect undesired behavior.</description>

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks, they remain prone to errors. A key challenge is enabling them to self-correct. While prior research has relied on external tools or large proprietary models, this work explores self-correction in small language models (SLMs) through iterative fine-tuning using solely self-generated data. We introduce the Self-Taught Self-Correction (STaSC) algorithm, which incorporates multiple algorithmic design choices. Experimental results on a question-answering task demonstrate that STaSC effectively learns self-correction, leading to significant performance improvements. Our analysis further provides insights into the mechanisms of self-correction and the impact of different design choices on learning dynamics and overall performance. To support future research, we release our user-friendly codebase and lightweight models.</description>

      <title>Learning Hypergraphs From Signals With Dual Smoothness Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01717v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypergraph structure learning, which aims to learn the hypergraph structures from the observed signals to capture the intrinsic high-order relationships among the entities, becomes crucial when a hypergraph topology is not readily available in the datasets. There are two challenges that lie at the heart of this problem: 1) how to handle the huge search space of potential hyperedges, and 2) how to define meaningful criteria to measure the relationship between the signals observed on nodes and the hypergraph structure. In this paper, for the first challenge, we adopt the assumption that the ideal hypergraph structure can be derived from a learnable graph structure that captures the pairwise relations within signals. Further, we propose a hypergraph structure learning framework HGSL with a novel dual smoothness prior that reveals a mapping between the observed node signals and the hypergraph structure, whereby each hyperedge corresponds to a subgraph with both node signal smoothness and edge signal smoothness in the learnable graph structure. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate HGSL on both synthetic and real world datasets. Experiments show that HGSL can efficiently infer meaningful hypergraph topologies from observed signals.</description>

      <title>Plant species richness prediction from DESIS hyperspectral data: A comparison study on feature extraction procedures and regression models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diversity of terrestrial vascular plants plays a key role in maintaining the stability and productivity of ecosystems. Airborne hyperspectral imaging has shown promise for measuring plant diversity remotely, but to operationalise these efforts over large regions we need to advance satellite-based alternatives. The advanced spectral and spatial specification of the recently launched DESIS (the DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer) instrument provides a unique opportunity to test the potential for monitoring plant species diversity with spaceborne hyperspectral data. This study provides a quantitative assessment on the ability of DESIS hyperspectral data for predicting plant species richness in two different habitat types in southeast Australia. Spectral features were first extracted from the DESIS spectra, then regressed against on-ground estimates of plant species richness, with a two-fold cross validation scheme to assess the predictive performance. We tested and compared the effectiveness of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and Partial Least Squares analysis (PLS) for feature extraction, and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Random Forest Regression (RFR) for species richness prediction. The best prediction results were $r=0.76$ and $\text{RMSE}=5.89$ for the Southern Tablelands region, and $r=0.68$ and $\text{RMSE}=5.95$ for the Snowy Mountains region. Relative importance analysis for the DESIS spectral bands showed that the red-edge, red, and blue spectral regions were more important for predicting plant species richness than the green bands and the near-infrared bands beyond red-edge. We also found that the DESIS hyperspectral data performed better than Sentinel-2 multispectral data in the prediction of plant species richness.</description>

However, the efficiency and accuracy of existing methods are constrained by the properties of numerical algorithms, such as finite difference and pseudo-spectral methods, integrated during the training stage. These methods necessitate careful spatiotemporal discretization to achieve reasonable accuracy, leading to significant computational challenges and inaccurate simulations, particularly in cases with substantial spatiotemporal variations. To address these limitations, we propose the Monte Carlo Neural PDE Solver (MCNP Solver) for training unsupervised neural solvers via the PDEs' probabilistic representation, which regards macroscopic phenomena as ensembles of random particles. Compared to other unsupervised methods, MCNP Solver naturally inherits the advantages of the Monte Carlo method, which is robust against spatiotemporal variations and can tolerate coarse step size. In simulating the trajectories of particles, we employ Heun's method for the convection process and calculate the expectation via the probability density function of neighbouring grid points during the diffusion process. These techniques enhance accuracy and circumvent the computational issues associated with Monte Carlo sampling. Our numerical experiments on convection-diffusion, Allen-Cahn, and Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency compared to other unsupervised baselines.

      <title>SketchOGD: Memory-Efficient Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: When machine learning models are trained continually on a sequence of tasks, they are often liable to forget what they learned on previous tasks--a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Proposed solutions to catastrophic forgetting tend to involve storing information about past tasks, meaning that memory usage is a chief consideration in determining their practicality. This paper develops a memory-efficient solution to catastrophic forgetting using the idea of matrix sketching, in the context of a simple continual learning algorithm known as orthogonal gradient descent (OGD). OGD finds weight updates that aim to preserve performance on prior datapoints, using gradients of the model on those datapoints. However, since the memory cost of storing prior model gradients grows with the runtime of the algorithm, OGD is ill-suited to continual learning over long time horizons. To address this problem, we propose SketchOGD. SketchOGD employs an online sketching algorithm to compress model gradients as they are encountered into a matrix of a fixed, user-determined size. In contrast to existing memory-efficient variants of OGD, SketchOGD runs online without the need for advance knowledge of the total number of tasks, is simple to implement, and is more amenable to analysis. We provide theoretical guarantees on the approximation error of the relevant sketches under a novel metric suited to the downstream task of OGD. Experimentally, we find that SketchOGD tends to outperform current state-of-the-art variants of OGD given a fixed memory budget.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Structure Inference From Data Under Smoothness Prior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are important for processing data with higher-order relationships involving more than two entities. In scenarios where explicit hypergraphs are not readily available, it is desirable to infer a meaningful hypergraph structure from the node features to capture the intrinsic relations within the data. However, existing methods either adopt simple pre-defined rules that fail to precisely capture the distribution of the potential hypergraph structure, or learn a mapping between hypergraph structures and node features but require a large amount of labelled data, i.e., pre-existing hypergraph structures, for training. Both restrict their applications in practical scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose a novel smoothness prior that enables us to design a method to infer the probability for each potential hyperedge without labelled data as supervision. The proposed prior indicates features of nodes in a hyperedge are highly correlated by the features of the hyperedge containing them. We use this prior to derive the relation between the hypergraph structure and the node features via probabilistic modelling. This allows us to develop an unsupervised inference method to estimate the probability for each potential hyperedge via solving an optimisation problem that has an analytical solution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method can learn meaningful hypergraph structures from data more efficiently than existing hypergraph structure inference methods.</description>

Abstract: Emerging from the pairwise attention in conventional Transformers, there is a growing interest in sparse attention mechanisms that align more closely with localized, contextual learning in the biological brain. Existing studies such as the Coordination method employ iterative cross-attention mechanisms with a bottleneck to enable the sparse association of inputs. However, these methods are parameter inefficient and fail in more complex relational reasoning tasks. To this end, we propose Associative Transformer (AiT) to enhance the association among sparsely attended input tokens, improving parameter efficiency and performance in various vision tasks such as classification and relational reasoning. AiT leverages a learnable explicit memory comprising specialized priors that guide bottleneck attentions to facilitate the extraction of diverse localized tokens. Moreover, AiT employs an associative memory-based token reconstruction using a Hopfield energy function. The extensive empirical experiments demonstrate that AiT requires significantly fewer parameters and attention layers outperforming a broad range of sparse Transformer models. Additionally, AiT outperforms the SOTA sparse Transformer models including the Coordination method on the Sort-of-CLEVR dataset.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Truth of Global Model: A Generic Solution to Defend Against Byzantine and Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning (full version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple parties to train machine learning models collaboratively without sharing the raw training data. However, the federated nature of FL enables malicious clients to influence a trained model by injecting error model updates via Byzantine or backdoor attacks. To detect malicious model updates, a typical approach is to measure the distance between each model update and a \textit{ground-truth model update}. To find such \textit{ground-truth model updates}, existing defenses either require a benign root dataset on the server (e.g., FLTrust) or simply use trimmed mean or median as the threshold for clipping (e.g., FLAME). However, such benign root datasets are impractical, and the trimmed mean or median may also eliminate contributions from these underrepresented datasets.
  In this paper, we propose a generic solution, namely FedTruth, to defend against model poisoning attacks in FL, where the \textit{ground-truth model update} (i.e., the global model update) will be estimated among all the model updates with dynamic aggregation weights. Specifically, FedTruth does not have specific assumptions on the benign or malicious data distribution or access to a benign root dataset. Moreover, FedTruth considers the potential contributions from all benign clients. Our empirical results show that FedTruth can reduce the impacts of poisoned model updates against both Byzantine and backdoor attacks, and is also efficient in large-scale FL systems.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Tensor Network, a novel framework that integrates tensor-based operations into the attention mechanism, thereby enhancing both the expressivity and computational efficiency of deep neural networks. Our approach leverages the algebraic structure of tensor products to generalize the conventional dot-product attention and to formulate new operators, namely, Tensor Attention and Tensor Interaction, which capture higher-order token dependencies. Through rigorous theoretical analysis based on the universal properties of tensor products, we demonstrate that our framework not only improves efficiency by reducing computational complexity but also offers a principled method for modeling complex interactions in sequential data. Empirical evaluations further substantiate that the proposed deep tensor network can serve as a robust building block for advancing state-of-the-art performance in various deep learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph-MLP: Learning on Hypergraphs without Message Passing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09778v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are vital in modelling data with higher-order relations containing more than two entities, gaining prominence in machine learning and signal processing. Many hypergraph neural networks leverage message passing over hypergraph structures to enhance node representation learning, yielding impressive performances in tasks like hypergraph node classification. However, these message-passing-based models face several challenges, including oversmoothing as well as high latency and sensitivity to structural perturbations at inference time. To tackle those challenges, we propose an alternative approach where we integrate the information about hypergraph structures into training supervision without explicit message passing, thus also removing the reliance on it at inference. Specifically, we introduce Hypergraph-MLP, a novel learning framework for hypergraph-structured data, where the learning model is a straightforward multilayer perceptron (MLP) supervised by a loss function based on a notion of signal smoothness on hypergraphs. Experiments on hypergraph node classification tasks demonstrate that Hypergraph-MLP achieves competitive performance compared to existing baselines, and is considerably faster and more robust against structural perturbations at inference.</description>

      <title>The Distributional Reward Critic Framework for Reinforcement Learning Under Perturbed Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reward signal plays a central role in defining the desired behaviors of agents in reinforcement learning (RL). Rewards collected from realistic environments could be perturbed, corrupted, or noisy due to an adversary, sensor error, or because they come from subjective human feedback. Thus, it is important to construct agents that can learn under such rewards. Existing methodologies for this problem make strong assumptions, including that the perturbation is known in advance, clean rewards are accessible, or that the perturbation preserves the optimal policy. We study a new, more general, class of unknown perturbations, and introduce a distributional reward critic framework for estimating reward distributions and perturbations during training. Our proposed methods are compatible with any RL algorithm. Despite their increased generality, we show that they achieve comparable or better rewards than existing methods in a variety of environments, including those with clean rewards. Under the challenging and generalized perturbations we study, we win/tie the highest return in 44/48 tested settings (compared to 11/48 for the best baseline). Our results broaden and deepen our ability to perform RL in reward-perturbed environments.</description>

      <title>Standard Gaussian Process is All You Need for High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02746v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A long-standing belief holds that Bayesian Optimization (BO) with standard Gaussian processes (GP) -- referred to as standard BO -- underperforms in high-dimensional optimization problems. While this belief seems plausible, it lacks both robust empirical evidence and theoretical justification. To address this gap, we present a systematic investigation. First, through a comprehensive evaluation across twelve benchmarks, we found that while the popular Square Exponential (SE) kernel often leads to poor performance, using Mat\'ern kernels enables standard BO to consistently achieve top-tier results, frequently surpassing methods specifically designed for high-dimensional optimization. Second, our theoretical analysis reveals that the SE kernel's failure primarily stems from improper initialization of the length-scale parameters, which are commonly used in practice but can cause gradient vanishing in training. We provide a probabilistic bound to characterize this issue, showing that Mat\'ern kernels are less susceptible and can robustly handle much higher dimensions. Third, we propose a simple robust initialization strategy that dramatically improves the performance of the SE kernel, bringing it close to state-of-the-art methods, without requiring additional priors or regularization. We prove another probabilistic bound that demonstrates how the gradient vanishing issue can be effectively mitigated with our method. Our findings advocate for a re-evaluation of standard BO's potential in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Widely used deep latent variable models (DLVMs), in particular Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), employ overly simplistic priors on the latent space. To achieve strong clustering performance, existing methods that replace the standard normal prior with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) require defining the number of clusters to be close to the number of expected ground truth classes a-priori and are susceptible to poor initializations. We leverage VampPrior concepts (Tomczak and Welling, 2018) to fit a Bayesian GMM prior, resulting in the VampPrior Mixture Model (VMM), a novel prior for DLVMs. In a VAE, the VMM attains highly competitive clustering performance on benchmark datasets. Integrating the VMM into scVI (Lopez et al., 2018), a popular scRNA-seq integration method, significantly improves its performance and automatically arranges cells into clusters with similar biological characteristics.</description>

      <title>Perfect Recovery for Random Geometric Graph Matching with Shallow Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the graph matching problem in the presence of vertex feature information using shallow graph neural networks. Specifically, given two graphs that are independent perturbations of a single random geometric graph with sparse binary features, the task is to recover an unknown one-to-one mapping between the vertices of the two graphs. We show under certain conditions on the sparsity and noise level of the feature vectors, a carefully designed two-layer graph neural network can, with high probability, recover the correct mapping between the vertices with the help of the graph structure. Additionally, we prove that our condition on the noise parameter is tight up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we compare the performance of the graph neural network to directly solving an assignment problem using the noisy vertex features and demonstrate that when the noise level is at least constant, this direct matching fails to achieve perfect recovery, whereas the graph neural network can tolerate noise levels growing as fast as a power of the size of the graph. Our theoretical findings are further supported by numerical studies as well as real-world data experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have become the leading approach for distribution learning. This paper focuses on structure-preserving diffusion models (SPDM), a specific subset of diffusion processes tailored for distributions with inherent structures, such as group symmetries. We complement existing sufficient conditions for constructing SPDMs by proving complementary necessary ones. Additionally, we propose a new framework that considers the geometric structures affecting the diffusion process. Leveraging this framework, we design a structure-preserving bridge model that maintains alignment between the model's endpoint couplings. Empirical evaluations on equivariant diffusion models demonstrate their effectiveness in learning symmetric distributions and modeling transitions between them. Experiments on real-world medical images confirm that our models preserve equivariance while maintaining high sample quality. We also showcase the practical utility of our framework by implementing an equivariant denoising diffusion bridge model, which achieves reliable equivariant image noise reduction and style transfer, irrespective of prior knowledge of image orientation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized learning (DL) is an emerging paradigm of collaborative machine learning that enables nodes in a network to train models collectively without sharing their raw data or relying on a central server. This paper introduces Zip-DL, a privacy-aware DL algorithm that leverages correlated noise to achieve robust privacy against local adversaries while ensuring efficient convergence at low communication costs. By progressively neutralizing the noise added during distributed averaging, Zip-DL combines strong privacy guarantees with high model accuracy. Its design requires only one communication round per gradient descent iteration, significantly reducing communication overhead compared to competitors. We establish theoretical bounds on both convergence speed and privacy guarantees. Moreover, extensive experiments demonstrating Zip-DL's practical applicability make it outperform state-of-the-art methods in the accuracy vs. vulnerability trade-off. Specifically, Zip-DL (i) reduces membership-inference attack success rates by up to 35% compared to baseline DL, (ii) decreases attack efficacy by up to 13% compared to competitors offering similar utility, and (iii) achieves up to 59% higher accuracy to completely nullify a basic attack scenario, compared to a state-of-the-art privacy-preserving approach under the same threat model. These results position Zip-DL as a practical and efficient solution for privacy-preserving decentralized learning in real-world applications.</description>

Abstract: A probabilistic graphical model is proposed, modeling the joint model parameter and multiplier evolution, with a hypervolume based likelihood, promoting multi-objective descent in structural risk minimization. We address multi-objective model parameter optimization via a surrogate single objective penalty loss with time-varying multipliers, equivalent to online scheduling of loss landscape. The multi-objective descent goal is dispatched hierarchically into a series of constraint optimization sub-problems with shrinking bounds according to Pareto dominance. The bound serves as setpoint for the low-level multiplier controller to schedule loss landscapes via output feedback of each loss term. Our method forms closed loop of model parameter dynamic, circumvents excessive memory requirements and extra computational burden of existing multi-objective deep learning methods, and is robust against controller hyperparameter variation, demonstrated on domain generalization tasks with multi-dimensional regularization losses.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Increased Client Participation with Cohort-Parallel Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning approach where nodes collaboratively train a global model. As more nodes participate in a round of FL, the effectiveness of individual model updates by nodes also diminishes. In this study, we increase the effectiveness of client updates by dividing the network into smaller partitions, or cohorts. We introduce Cohort-Parallel Federated Learning (CPFL): a novel learning approach where each cohort independently trains a global model using FL, until convergence, and the produced models by each cohort are then unified using knowledge distillation. The insight behind CPFL is that smaller, isolated networks converge quicker than in a one-network setting where all nodes participate. Through exhaustive experiments involving realistic traces and non-IID data distributions on the CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST image classification tasks, we investigate the balance between the number of cohorts, model accuracy, training time, and compute resources. Compared to traditional FL, CPFL with four cohorts, non-IID data distribution, and CIFAR-10 yields a 1.9x reduction in train time and a 1.3x reduction in resource usage, with a minimal drop in test accuracy.</description>

      <title>Does SGD really happen in tiny subspaces?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks is challenging due to their high-dimensional nature and intricate loss landscapes. Recent studies have revealed that, along the training trajectory, the gradient approximately aligns with a low-rank top eigenspace of the training loss Hessian, referred to as the dominant subspace. Given this alignment, this paper explores whether neural networks can be trained within the dominant subspace, which, if feasible, could lead to more efficient training methods. Our primary observation is that when the SGD update is projected onto the dominant subspace, the training loss does not decrease further. This suggests that the observed alignment between the gradient and the dominant subspace is spurious. Surprisingly, projecting out the dominant subspace proves to be just as effective as the original update, despite removing the majority of the original update component. We observe similar behavior across practical setups, including the large learning rate regime (also known as Edge of Stability), Sharpness-Aware Minimization, momentum, and adaptive optimizers. We discuss the main causes and implications of this spurious alignment, shedding light on the dynamics of neural network training.</description>

      <title>AdaFisher: Adaptive Second Order Optimization via Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First-order optimization methods are currently the mainstream in training deep neural networks (DNNs). Optimizers like Adam incorporate limited curvature information by employing the diagonal matrix preconditioning of the stochastic gradient during the training. Despite their widespread, second-order optimization algorithms exhibit superior convergence properties compared to their first-order counterparts e.g. Adam and SGD. However, their practicality in training DNNs is still limited due to increased per-iteration computations compared to the first-order methods. We present \emph{AdaFisher}--an adaptive second-order optimizer that leverages a \emph{diagonal block-Kronecker} approximation of the Fisher information matrix for adaptive gradient preconditioning. AdaFisher aims to bridge the gap between enhanced \emph{convergence/generalization} capabilities and computational efficiency in second-order optimization framework for training DNNs. Despite the slow pace of second-order optimizers, we showcase that AdaFisher can be reliably adopted for image classification, language modeling and stands out for its stability and robustness in hyper-parameter tuning. We demonstrate that AdaFisher \textbf{outperforms the SOTA optimizers} in terms of both accuracy and convergence speed.

      <title>Synthesizing Programmatic Reinforcement Learning Policies with Large Language Model Guided Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16450v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Programmatic reinforcement learning (PRL) has been explored for representing policies through programs as a means to achieve interpretability and generalization. Despite promising outcomes, current state-of-the-art PRL methods are hindered by sample inefficiency, necessitating tens of millions of program-environment interactions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel LLM-guided search framework (LLM-GS). Our key insight is to leverage the programming expertise and common sense reasoning of LLMs to enhance the efficiency of assumption-free, random-guessing search methods. We address the challenge of LLMs' inability to generate precise and grammatically correct programs in domain-specific languages (DSLs) by proposing a Pythonic-DSL strategy - an LLM is instructed to initially generate Python codes and then convert them into DSL programs. To further optimize the LLM-generated programs, we develop a search algorithm named Scheduled Hill Climbing, designed to efficiently explore the programmatic search space to improve the programs consistently. Experimental results in the Karel domain demonstrate our LLM-GS framework's superior effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive ablation studies further verify the critical role of our Pythonic-DSL strategy and Scheduled Hill Climbing algorithm. Moreover, we conduct experiments with two novel tasks, showing that LLM-GS enables users without programming skills and knowledge of the domain or DSL to describe the tasks in natural language to obtain performant programs.</description>

      <title>SysCaps: Language Interfaces for Simulation Surrogates of Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surrogate models are used to predict the behavior of complex energy systems that are too expensive to simulate with traditional numerical methods. Our work introduces the use of language descriptions, which we call ``system captions'' or SysCaps, to interface with such surrogates. We argue that interacting with surrogates through text, particularly natural language, makes these models more accessible for both experts and non-experts. We introduce a lightweight multimodal text and timeseries regression model and a training pipeline that uses large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality captions from simulation metadata. Our experiments on two real-world simulators of buildings and wind farms show that our SysCaps-augmented surrogates have better accuracy on held-out systems than traditional methods while enjoying new generalization abilities, such as handling semantically related descriptions of the same test system. Additional experiments also highlight the potential of SysCaps to unlock language-driven design space exploration and to regularize training through prompt augmentation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Trajectory Inference in Wasserstein Space Using Consecutive Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Capturing data from dynamic processes through cross-sectional measurements is seen in many fields, such as computational biology. Trajectory inference deals with the challenge of reconstructing continuous processes from such observations. In this work, we propose methods for B-spline approximation and interpolation of point clouds through consecutive averaging that is intrinsic to the Wasserstein space. Combining subdivision schemes with optimal transport-based geodesic, our methods carry out trajectory inference at a chosen level of precision and smoothness, and can automatically handle scenarios where particles undergo division over time. We prove linear convergence rates and rigorously evaluate our method on cell data characterized by bifurcations, merges, and trajectory splitting scenarios like $supercells$, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art trajectory inference and interpolation methods. The results not only underscore the effectiveness of our method in inferring trajectories but also highlight the benefit of performing interpolation and approximation that respect the inherent geometric properties of the data.</description>

      <title>Value Improved Actor Critic Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To learn approximately optimal acting policies for decision problems, modern Actor Critic algorithms rely on deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to parameterize the acting policy and greedification operators to iteratively improve it. The reliance on DNNs suggests an improvement that is gradient based, which is per step much less greedy than the improvement possible by greedier operators such as the greedy update used by Q-learning algorithms. On the other hand, slow and steady changes to the policy can also be beneficial for the stability of the learning process, resulting in a tradeoff between greedification and stability. To address this tradeoff, we propose to extend the standard framework of actor critic algorithms with value-improvement: a second greedification operator applied only when updating the policy's value estimate. In this framework the agent can evaluate non-parameterized policies and perform much greedier updates while maintaining the steady gradient-based improvement to the parameterized acting policy. We prove that this approach converges in the popular analysis scheme of Generalized Policy Iteration in the finite-horizon domain. Empirically, incorporating value-improvement into the popular off-policy actor-critic algorithms TD3 and SAC significantly improves or matches performance over their respective baselines, across different environments from the DeepMind continuous control domain, with negligible compute and implementation cost.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Armed Bandit Approach to Online Selection and Evaluation of Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing frameworks for evaluating and comparing generative models consider an offline setting, where the evaluator has access to large batches of data produced by the models. However, in practical scenarios, the goal is often to identify and select the best model using the fewest possible generated samples to minimize the costs of querying data from the sub-optimal models. In this work, we propose an online evaluation and selection framework to find the generative model that maximizes a standard assessment score among a group of available models. We view the task as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) and propose upper confidence bound (UCB) bandit algorithms to identify the model producing data with the best evaluation score that quantifies the quality and diversity of generated data. Specifically, we develop the MAB-based selection of generative models considering the Fr\'echet Distance (FD) and Inception Score (IS) metrics, resulting in the FD-UCB and IS-UCB algorithms. We prove regret bounds for these algorithms and present numerical results on standard image datasets. Our empirical results suggest the efficacy of MAB approaches for the sample-efficient evaluation and selection of deep generative models.

      <title>Loss Gradient Gaussian Width based Generalization and Optimization Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalization and optimization guarantees on the population loss often rely on uniform convergence based analysis, typically based on the Rademacher complexity of the predictors. The rich representation power of modern models has led to concerns about this approach. In this paper, we present generalization and optimization guarantees in terms of the complexity of the gradients, as measured by the Loss Gradient Gaussian Width (LGGW). First, we introduce generalization guarantees directly in terms of the LGGW under a flexible gradient domination condition, which includes the popular PL (Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz) condition as a special case. Second, we show that sample reuse in iterative gradient descent does not make the empirical gradients deviate from the population gradients as long as the LGGW is small. Third, focusing on deep networks, we bound their single-sample LGGW in terms of the Gaussian width of the featurizer, i.e., the output of the last-but-one layer. To our knowledge, our generalization and optimization guarantees in terms of LGGW are the first results of its kind, and hold considerable promise towards quantitatively tight bounds for deep models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From pedestrians to Kuramoto oscillators, interactions between agents govern how dynamical systems evolve in space and time. Discovering how these agents relate to each other has the potential to improve our understanding of the often complex dynamics that underlie these systems. Recent works learn to categorize relationships between agents based on observations of their physical behavior. These approaches model relationship categories as outcomes of a categorical distribution which is limiting and contrary to real-world systems, where relationship categories often intermingle and interact. In this work, we introduce a level of abstraction between the observable behavior of agents and the latent categories that determine their behavior. To do this, we learn a mapping from agent observations to agent preferences for a set of latent categories. The learned preferences and inter-agent proximity are integrated in a nonlinear opinion dynamics model, which allows us to naturally identify mutually exclusive categories, predict an agent's evolution in time, and control an agent's behavior. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the utility of our model for learning interpretable categories, and the efficacy of our model for long-horizon trajectory prediction.</description>

      <title>How Data Inter-connectivity Shapes LLMs Unlearning: A Structural Unlearning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While unlearning knowledge from large language models (LLMs) is receiving increasing attention, one important aspect remains unexplored. Existing approaches and benchmarks assume data points to-be-forgotten are independent, ignoring their inter-connectivity - a fundamental characteristic of real-world data structures. In this paper, we propose PISTOL, a method for compiling structural datasets. PISTOL leverages the inherently structured nature of contractual relationships, offering several key benefits. First, it enables insights into the impact of structural data on unlearning effectiveness. Second, it provides precise and concise ground truths for clearer evaluation. Third, its attribute generation does not require input from pre-trained LLMs, mitigating confounding risks. Leveraging datasets synthesized using PISTOL, we demonstrate how data inter-connectivity impacts LLM unlearning. Specifically, (a) in both the pre-trained and fine-tuned models, unlearning difficulty increases as data inter-connectivity grows, (b) there is a positive correlation between the density of the knowledge graph and unlearning difficulty, and (c) when the to-be-forgotten data is skewed towards one domain, balancing retaining performance across all domains is challenging.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Topology Reconstruction for Robust Graph Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become fundamental in semi-supervised learning for graph representation, leveraging their ability to capture complex node relationships. A recent trend in GNN research focuses on adaptive multi-hop structure learning, moving beyond fixed-hop aggregation to more flexible and dynamic neighborhood selection. While GAMLP \citep{Zhang_2022} employs separate MLP layers for each multi-hop domain and ImprovingTE \citep{Yao2023ImprovingTE} enhances this by injecting contextualized substructure information, these methods still rely heavily on predefined sampling strategies, which may limit their ability to generalize and maintain stable accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose an \textbf{adaptive reconstruction framework} that dynamically refines multi-hop structure learning. Inspired by "coreset selection" \citep{guo2022deepcore}, our approach adaptively \textbf{reconstructs} node neighborhoods to optimize message passing, ensuring more \textbf{effective and context-aware information flow} across the graph. To further enhance structural robustness, we introduce two key modules: the \textbf{Distance Recomputator} and the \textbf{Topology Reconstructor} (\textcolor{blue}{DRTR}). The Distance Recomputator \textbf{reassesses and recalibrates} node distances based on adaptive graph properties, leading to \textbf{improved node embeddings} that better reflect latent relationships. Meanwhile, the Topology Reconstructor \textbf{dynamically refines local graph structures}, enabling the model to \textbf{adapt to evolving graph topologies} and mitigate the impact of noise and mislabeled data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our \textbf{adaptive reconstruction framework} achieves \textbf{significant improvements} over existing multi-hop-based models, providing more \textbf{stable and accurate} performance in various graph learning benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: We address the problem of causal effect estimation where hidden confounders are present, with a focus on two settings: instrumental variable regression with additional observed confounders, and proxy causal learning. Our approach uses a singular value decomposition of a conditional expectation operator, followed by a saddle-point optimization problem, which, in the context of IV regression, can be thought of as a neural net generalization of the seminal approach due to Darolles et al. [2011]. Saddle-point formulations have gathered considerable attention recently, as they can avoid double sampling bias and are amenable to modern function approximation methods. We provide experimental validation in various settings, and show that our approach outperforms existing methods on common benchmarks.</description>

      <title>To which reference class do you belong? Measuring racial fairness of reference classes with normative modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reference classes in healthcare establish healthy norms, such as pediatric growth charts of height and weight, and are used to chart deviations from these norms which represent potential clinical risk. How the demographics of the reference class influence clinical interpretation of deviations is unknown. Using normative modeling, a method for building reference classes, we evaluate the fairness (racial bias) in reference models of structural brain images that are widely used in psychiatry and neurology. We test whether including race in the model creates fairer models. We predict self-reported race using the deviation scores from three different reference class normative models, to better understand bias in an integrated, multivariate sense. Across all of these tasks, we uncover racial disparities that are not easily addressed with existing data or commonly used modeling techniques. Our work suggests that deviations from the norm could be due to demographic mismatch with the reference class, and assigning clinical meaning to these deviations should be done with caution. Our approach also suggests that acquiring more representative samples is an urgent research priority.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Predicting Chaotic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20158v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting chaotic dynamical systems is critical in many scientific fields, such as weather forecasting, but challenging due to the characteristic sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Traditional modeling approaches require extensive domain knowledge, often leading to a shift towards data-driven methods using machine learning. However, existing research provides inconclusive results on which machine learning methods are best suited for predicting chaotic systems. In this paper, we compare different lightweight and heavyweight machine learning architectures using extensive existing benchmark databases, as well as a newly introduced database that allows for uncertainty quantification in the benchmark results. In addition to state-of-the-art methods from the literature, we also present new advantageous variants of established methods. Hyperparameter tuning is adjusted based on computational cost, with more tuning allocated to less costly methods. Furthermore, we introduce the cumulative maximum error, a novel metric that combines desirable properties of traditional metrics and is tailored for chaotic systems. Our results show that well-tuned simple methods, as well as untuned baseline methods, often outperform state-of-the-art deep learning models, but their performance can vary significantly with different experimental setups. These findings highlight the importance of aligning prediction methods with data characteristics and caution against the indiscriminate use of overly complex models.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Efficient Electromagnetic Surrogate Solver for Broadband Field Prediction using Discrete Wavelength Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, electromagnetic surrogate solvers, trained on solutions of Maxwell's equations under specific simulation conditions, enabled real-time inference of computationally expensive simulations. However, conventional surrogate solvers often consider only a narrow range of simulation parameters and fail when encountering even slight variations in simulation conditions. To address this limitation, we propose a broadband surrogate solver capable of providing solutions across a continuous range of wavelengths, even when trained on discrete wavelength data. Our approach leverages a Wave-Informed element-wise Multiplicative Encoding and a Fourier Group Convolutional Shuffling operator to mitigate overfitting while capturing the fundamental characteristics of Maxwell's equations. Compared to the state-of-the-art surrogate solver, our model achieves a 74% reduction in parameters, an 80.5% improvement in prediction accuracy for untrained wavelengths, demonstrating superior generalization and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Information Loss in Tree-Based Reinforcement Learning via Direct Optimization</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has seen significant success across various domains, but its adoption is often limited by the black-box nature of neural network policies, making them difficult to interpret. In contrast, symbolic policies allow representing decision-making strategies in a compact and interpretable way. However, learning symbolic policies directly within on-policy methods remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce SYMPOL, a novel method for SYMbolic tree-based on-POLicy RL. SYMPOL employs a tree-based model integrated with a policy gradient method, enabling the agent to learn and adapt its actions while maintaining a high level of interpretability. We evaluate SYMPOL on a set of benchmark RL tasks, demonstrating its superiority over alternative tree-based RL approaches in terms of performance and interpretability. Unlike existing methods, it enables gradient-based, end-to-end learning of interpretable, axis-aligned decision trees within standard on-policy RL algorithms. Therefore, SYMPOL can become the foundation for a new class of interpretable RL based on decision trees. Our implementation is available under: https://github.com/s-marton/sympol</description>

      <title>Learning Regularization for Graph Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been utilized for various applications ranging from drug discovery to network design and social networks. In many applications, it is impossible to observe some properties of the graph directly; instead, noisy and indirect measurements of these properties are available. These scenarios are coined as Graph Inverse Problems (GRIP). In this work, we introduce a framework leveraging GNNs to solve GRIPs. The framework is based on a combination of likelihood and prior terms, which are used to find a solution that fits the data while adhering to learned prior information. Specifically, we propose to combine recent deep learning techniques that were developed for inverse problems, together with GNN architectures, to formulate and solve GRIP. We study our approach on a number of representative problems that demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework.</description>

      <title>Breaking Neural Network Scaling Laws with Modularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modular neural networks outperform nonmodular neural networks on tasks ranging from visual question answering to robotics. These performance improvements are thought to be due to modular networks' superior ability to model the compositional and combinatorial structure of real-world problems. However, a theoretical explanation of how modularity improves generalizability, and how to leverage task modularity while training networks remains elusive. Using recent theoretical progress in explaining neural network generalization, we investigate how the amount of training data required to generalize on a task varies with the intrinsic dimensionality of a task's input. We show theoretically that when applied to modularly structured tasks, while nonmodular networks require an exponential number of samples with task dimensionality, modular networks' sample complexity is independent of task dimensionality: modular networks can generalize in high dimensions. We then develop a novel learning rule for modular networks to exploit this advantage and empirically show the improved generalization of the rule, both in- and out-of-distribution, on high-dimensional, modular tasks.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Visions: Unsupervised Machine Learning Insights on Global Development Goals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of the United Nations outlines 17 goals for countries of the world to address global challenges in their development. However, the progress of countries towards these goal has been slower than expected and, consequently, there is a need to investigate the reasons behind this fact. In this study, we have used a novel data-driven methodology to analyze time-series data for over 20 years (2000-2022) from 107 countries using unsupervised machine learning (ML) techniques. Our analysis reveals strong positive and negative correlations between certain SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals). Our findings show that progress toward the SDGs is heavily influenced by geographical, cultural and socioeconomic factors, with no country on track to achieve all the goals by 2030. This highlights the need for a region-specific, systemic approach to sustainable development that acknowledges the complex interdependencies between the goals and the variable capacities of countries to reach them. For this our machine learning based approach provides a robust framework for developing efficient and data-informed strategies to promote cooperative and targeted initiatives for sustainable progress.</description>

      <title>Sample Compression Unleashed: New Generalization Bounds for Real Valued Losses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sample compression theory provides generalization guarantees for predictors that can be fully defined using a subset of the training dataset and a (short) message string, generally defined as a binary sequence. Previous works provided generalization bounds for the zero-one loss, which is restrictive notably when applied to deep learning approaches. In this paper, we present a general framework for deriving new sample compression bounds that hold for real-valued unbounded losses. Using the Pick-To-Learn (P2L) meta-algorithm, which transforms the training method of any machine-learning predictor to yield sample-compressed predictors, we empirically demonstrate the tightness of the bounds and their versatility by evaluating them on random forests and multiple types of neural networks.</description>

      <title>On Expressive Power of Looped Transformers: Theoretical Analysis and Enhancement via Timestep Encoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01405v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Looped Transformers provide advantages in parameter efficiency, computational capabilities, and generalization for reasoning tasks. However, their expressive power regarding function approximation remains underexplored. In this paper, we establish the approximation rate of Looped Transformers by defining the modulus of continuity for sequence-to-sequence functions. This reveals a limitation specific to the looped architecture. That is, the analysis prompts the incorporation of scaling parameters for each loop, conditioned on timestep encoding. Experiments validate the theoretical results, showing that increasing the number of loops enhances performance, with further gains achieved through the timestep encoding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cellular automata have become a cornerstone for investigating emergence and self-organization across diverse scientific disciplines. However, the absence of a hardware-accelerated cellular automata library limits the exploration of new research directions, hinders collaboration, and impedes reproducibility. In this work, we introduce CAX (Cellular Automata Accelerated in JAX), a high-performance and flexible open-source library designed to accelerate cellular automata research. CAX delivers cutting-edge performance through hardware acceleration while maintaining flexibility through its modular architecture, intuitive API, and support for both discrete and continuous cellular automata in arbitrary dimensions. We demonstrate CAX's performance and flexibility through a wide range of benchmarks and applications. From classic models like elementary cellular automata and Conway's Game of Life to advanced applications such as growing neural cellular automata and self-classifying MNIST digits, CAX speeds up simulations up to 2,000 times faster. Furthermore, we demonstrate CAX's potential to accelerate research by presenting a collection of three novel cellular automata experiments, each implemented in just a few lines of code thanks to the library's modular architecture. Notably, we show that a simple one-dimensional cellular automaton can outperform GPT-4 on the 1D-ARC challenge.</description>

      <title>Efficient Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Through Optimistic Thompson Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning complex robot behavior through interactions with the environment necessitates principled exploration. Effective strategies should prioritize exploring regions of the state-action space that maximize rewards, with optimistic exploration emerging as a promising direction aligned with this idea and enabling sample-efficient reinforcement learning. However, existing methods overlook a crucial aspect: the need for optimism to be informed by a belief connecting the reward and state. To address this, we propose a practical, theoretically grounded approach to optimistic exploration based on Thompson sampling. Our model structure is the first that allows for reasoning about joint uncertainty over transitions and rewards. We apply our method on a set of MuJoCo and VMAS continuous control tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that optimistic exploration significantly accelerates learning in environments with sparse rewards, action penalties, and difficult-to-explore regions. Furthermore, we provide insights into when optimism is beneficial and emphasize the critical role of model uncertainty in guiding exploration.</description>

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP), a distribution-free uncertainty quantification (UQ) framework, reliably provides valid predictive inference for black-box models. CP constructs prediction sets that contain the true output with a specified probability. However, modern data science diverse modalities, along with increasing data and model complexity, challenge traditional CP methods. These developments have spurred novel approaches to address evolving scenarios. This survey reviews the foundational concepts of CP and recent advancements from a data-centric perspective, including applications to structured, unstructured, and dynamic data. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities CP faces in large-scale data and models.</description>

      <title>Chemistry-Inspired Diffusion with Non-Differentiable Guidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential in the conditional generation of novel molecules. These models can be guided in two ways: (i) explicitly, through additional features representing the condition, or (ii) implicitly, using a property predictor. However, training property predictors or conditional diffusion models requires an abundance of labeled data and is inherently challenging in real-world applications. We propose a novel approach that attenuates the limitations of acquiring large labeled datasets by leveraging domain knowledge from quantum chemistry as a non-differentiable oracle to guide an unconditional diffusion model. Instead of relying on neural networks, the oracle provides accurate guidance in the form of estimated gradients, allowing the diffusion process to sample from a conditional distribution specified by quantum chemistry. We show that this results in more precise conditional generation of novel and stable molecular structures. Our experiments demonstrate that our method: (1) significantly reduces atomic forces, enhancing the validity of generated molecules when used for stability optimization; (2) is compatible with both explicit and implicit guidance in diffusion models, enabling joint optimization of molecular properties and stability; and (3) generalizes effectively to molecular optimization tasks beyond stability optimization.</description>

      <title>Transformers Provably Solve Parity Efficiently with Chain of Thought</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08633v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work provides the first theoretical analysis of training transformers to solve complex problems by recursively generating intermediate states, analogous to fine-tuning for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. We consider training a one-layer transformer to solve the fundamental $k$-parity problem, extending the work on RNNs by Wies et al. (2023). We establish three key results: (1) any finite-precision gradient-based algorithm, without intermediate supervision, requires substantial iterations to solve parity with finite samples. (2) In contrast, when intermediate parities are incorporated into the loss function, our model can learn parity in one gradient update when aided by \emph{teacher forcing}, where ground-truth labels of the reasoning chain are provided at each generation step. (3) Even without teacher forcing, where the model must generate CoT chains end-to-end, parity can be learned efficiently if augmented data is employed to internally verify the soundness of intermediate steps. Our findings, supported by numerical experiments, show that task decomposition and stepwise reasoning naturally arise from optimizing transformers with CoT; moreover, self-consistency checking can improve multi-step reasoning ability, aligning with empirical studies of CoT.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Time Series Anomaly Prediction with Importance-based Generative Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series anomaly prediction plays an essential role in many real-world scenarios, such as environmental prevention and prompt maintenance of cyber-physical systems. However, existing time series anomaly prediction methods mainly require supervised training with plenty of manually labeled data, which are difficult to obtain in practice. Besides, unseen anomalies can occur during inference, which could differ from the labeled training data and make these models fail to predict such new anomalies. In this paper, we study a novel problem of unsupervised time series anomaly prediction. We provide a theoretical analysis and propose Importance-based Generative Contrastive Learning (IGCL) to address the aforementioned problems. IGCL distinguishes between normal and anomaly precursors, which are generated by our anomaly precursor pattern generation module. To address the efficiency issues caused by the potential complex anomaly precursor combinations, we propose a memory bank with importance-based scores to adaptively store representative anomaly precursors and generate more complicated anomaly precursors. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets show our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on unsupervised time series anomaly prediction problems.</description>

      <title>Spatioformer: A Geo-encoded Transformer for Large-Scale Plant Species Richness Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth observation data have shown promise in predicting species richness of vascular plants ($\alpha$-diversity), but extending this approach to large spatial scales is challenging because geographically distant regions may exhibit different compositions of plant species ($\beta$-diversity), resulting in a location-dependent relationship between richness and spectral measurements. In order to handle such geolocation dependency, we propose \textit{Spatioformer}, where a novel geolocation encoder is coupled with the transformer model to encode geolocation context into remote sensing imagery. The Spatioformer model compares favourably to state-of-the-art models in richness predictions on a large-scale ground-truth richness dataset (HAVPlot) that consists of 68,170 in-situ richness samples covering diverse landscapes across Australia. The results demonstrate that geolocational information is advantageous in predicting species richness from satellite observations over large spatial scales. With Spatioformer, plant species richness maps over Australia are compiled from Landsat archive for the years from 2015 to 2023. The richness maps produced in this study reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics of plant species richness in Australia, providing supporting evidence to inform effective planning and policy development for plant diversity conservation. Regions of high richness prediction uncertainties are identified, highlighting the need for future in-situ surveys to be conducted in these areas to enhance the prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Fourier Head: Helping Large Language Models Learn Complex Probability Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the quality of large language models has improved, there has been increased interest in using them to model non-linguistic tokens. For example, the Decision Transformer recasts agentic decision making as a sequence modeling problem, using a decoder-only LLM to model the distribution over the discrete action space for an Atari agent. However, when adapting LLMs to non-linguistic domains, it remains unclear if softmax over discrete bins captures the continuous structure of the tokens and the potentially complex distributions needed for high quality token generation. We introduce a neural network layer, constructed using Fourier series, which we can easily substitute for any linear layer if we want the outputs to have a more continuous structure. We perform extensive analysis on synthetic datasets, as well as on large-scale decision making and time series forecasting tasks. We also provide theoretical evidence that this layer can better learn signal from data while ignoring high-frequency noise. All of our results support the effectiveness of our proposed Fourier head in scenarios where the underlying data distribution has a natural continuous structure. For example, the Fourier head improves a Decision Transformer agent's returns across four benchmark Atari games by as much as 377%, and increases a state-of-the-art times series foundation model's forecasting performance by 3.5% across 20 benchmarks unseen during training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many risk-sensitive applications require well-calibrated prediction sets over multiple, potentially correlated target variables, for which the prediction algorithm may report correlated errors. In this work, we aim to construct the conformal prediction set accounting for the joint correlation structure of the vector-valued non-conformity scores. Drawing from the rich literature on multivariate quantiles and semiparametric statistics, we propose an algorithm to estimate the $1-\alpha$ quantile of the scores, where $\alpha$ is the user-specified miscoverage rate. In particular, we flexibly estimate the joint cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the scores using nonparametric vine copulas and improve the asymptotic efficiency of the quantile estimate using its influence function. The vine decomposition allows our method to scale well to a large number of targets. As well as guaranteeing asymptotically exact coverage, our method yields desired coverage and competitive efficiency on a range of real-world regression problems, including those with missing-at-random labels in the calibration set.</description>

      <title>Variance-Aware Linear UCB with Deep Representation for Neural Contextual Bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By leveraging the representation power of deep neural networks, neural upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms have shown success in contextual bandits. To further balance the exploration and exploitation, we propose Neural-$\sigma^2$-LinearUCB, a variance-aware algorithm that utilizes $\sigma^2_t$, i.e., an upper bound of the reward noise variance at round $t$, to enhance the uncertainty quantification quality of the UCB, resulting in a regret performance improvement. We provide an oracle version for our algorithm characterized by an oracle variance upper bound $\sigma^2_t$ and a practical version with a novel estimation for this variance bound. Theoretically, we provide rigorous regret analysis for both versions and prove that our oracle algorithm achieves a better regret guarantee than other neural-UCB algorithms in the neural contextual bandits setting. Empirically, our practical method enjoys a similar computational efficiency, while outperforming state-of-the-art techniques by having a better calibration and lower regret across multiple standard settings, including on the synthetic, UCI, MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets.</description>

      <title>Learning Gaussian Multi-Index Models with Gradient Flow: Time Complexity and Directional Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on the gradient flow dynamics of a neural network model that uses correlation loss to approximate a multi-index function on high-dimensional standard Gaussian data. Specifically, the multi-index function we consider is a sum of neurons $f^*(x) \!=\! \sum_{j=1}^k \! \sigma^*(v_j^T x)$ where $v_1, \dots, v_k$ are unit vectors, and $\sigma^*$ lacks the first and second Hermite polynomials in its Hermite expansion. It is known that, for the single-index case ($k\!=\!1$), overcoming the search phase requires polynomial time complexity. We first generalize this result to multi-index functions characterized by vectors in arbitrary directions. After the search phase, it is not clear whether the network neurons converge to the index vectors, or get stuck at a sub-optimal solution. When the index vectors are orthogonal, we give a complete characterization of the fixed points and prove that neurons converge to the nearest index vectors. Therefore, using $n \! \asymp \! k \log k$ neurons ensures finding the full set of index vectors with gradient flow with high probability over random initialization. When $ v_i^T v_j \!=\! \beta \! \geq \! 0$ for all $i \neq j$, we prove the existence of a sharp threshold $\beta_c \!=\! c/(c+k)$ at which the fixed point that computes the average of the index vectors transitions from a saddle point to a minimum. Numerical simulations show that using a correlation loss and a mild overparameterization suffices to learn all of the index vectors when they are nearly orthogonal, however, the correlation loss fails when the dot product between the index vectors exceeds a certain threshold.</description>

      <title>Cut Your Losses in Large-Vocabulary Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As language models grow ever larger, so do their vocabularies. This has shifted the memory footprint of LLMs during training disproportionately to one single layer: the cross-entropy in the loss computation. Cross-entropy builds up a logit matrix with entries for each pair of input tokens and vocabulary items and, for small models, consumes an order of magnitude more memory than the rest of the LLM combined. We propose Cut Cross-Entropy (CCE), a method that computes the cross-entropy loss without materializing the logits for all tokens into global memory. Rather, CCE only computes the logit for the correct token and evaluates the log-sum-exp over all logits on the fly. We implement a custom kernel that performs the matrix multiplications and the log-sum-exp reduction over the vocabulary in flash memory, making global memory consumption for the cross-entropy computation negligible. This has a dramatic effect. Taking the Gemma 2 (2B) model as an example, CCE reduces the memory footprint of the loss computation from 24 GB to 1 MB, and the total training-time memory consumption of the classifier head from 28 GB to 1 GB. To improve the throughput of CCE, we leverage the inherent sparsity of softmax and propose to skip elements of the gradient computation that have a negligible (i.e., below numerical precision) contribution to the gradient. Experiments demonstrate that the dramatic reduction in memory consumption is accomplished without sacrificing training speed or convergence.</description>

      <title>Hysteresis Activation Function for Efficient Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widely used ReLU is favored for its hardware efficiency, {as the implementation at inference is a one bit sign case,} yet suffers from issues such as the ``dying ReLU'' problem, where during training, neurons fail to activate and constantly remain at zero, as highlighted by Lu et al. Traditional approaches to mitigate this issue often introduce more complex and less hardware-friendly activation functions. In this work, we propose a Hysteresis Rectified Linear Unit (HeLU), an efficient activation function designed to address the ``dying ReLU'' problem with minimal complexity. Unlike traditional activation functions with fixed thresholds for training and inference, HeLU employs a variable threshold that refines the backpropagation. This refined mechanism allows simpler activation functions to achieve competitive performance comparable to their more complex counterparts without introducing unnecessary complexity or requiring inductive biases. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that HeLU enhances model generalization across diverse datasets, offering a promising solution for efficient and effective inference suitable for a wide range of neural network architectures.</description>

      <title>Towards Million-Scale Adversarial Robustness Evaluation With Stronger Individual Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15210v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As deep learning models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, evaluating their vulnerabilities to adversarial perturbations is essential for ensuring their reliability and trustworthiness. Over the past decade, a large number of white-box adversarial robustness evaluation methods (i.e., attacks) have been proposed, ranging from single-step to multi-step methods and from individual to ensemble methods. Despite these advances, challenges remain in conducting meaningful and comprehensive robustness evaluations, particularly when it comes to large-scale testing and ensuring evaluations reflect real-world adversarial risks. In this work, we focus on image classification models and propose a novel individual attack method, Probability Margin Attack (PMA), which defines the adversarial margin in the probability space rather than the logits space. We analyze the relationship between PMA and existing cross-entropy or logits-margin-based attacks, and show that PMA can outperform the current state-of-the-art individual methods. Building on PMA, we propose two types of ensemble attacks that balance effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, we create a million-scale dataset, CC1M, derived from the existing CC3M dataset, and use it to conduct the first million-scale white-box adversarial robustness evaluation of adversarially-trained ImageNet models. Our findings provide valuable insights into the robustness gaps between individual versus ensemble attacks and small-scale versus million-scale evaluations.</description>

      <title>Reward Fine-Tuning Two-Step Diffusion Models via Learning Differentiable Latent-Space Surrogate Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has shown that fine-tuning diffusion models (DMs) with arbitrary rewards, including non-differentiable ones, is feasible with reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, enabling flexible model alignment. However, applying existing RL methods to step-distilled DMs is challenging for ultra-fast ($\le2$-step) image generation. Our analysis suggests several limitations of policy-based RL methods such as PPO or DPO toward this goal. Based on the insights, we propose fine-tuning DMs with learned differentiable surrogate rewards. Our method, named LaSRO, learns surrogate reward models in the latent space of SDXL to convert arbitrary rewards into differentiable ones for effective reward gradient guidance. LaSRO leverages pre-trained latent DMs for reward modeling and tailors reward optimization for $\le2$-step image generation with efficient off-policy exploration. LaSRO is effective and stable for improving ultra-fast image generation with different reward objectives, outperforming popular RL methods including DDPO and Diffusion-DPO. We further show LaSRO's connection to value-based RL, providing theoretical insights. See our webpage \href{https://sites.google.com/view/lasro}{here}.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Methods through the Lens of SDEs: Theoretical Insights on the Role of Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the vast empirical evidence supporting the efficacy of adaptive optimization methods in deep learning, their theoretical understanding is far from complete. This work introduces novel SDEs for commonly used adaptive optimizers: SignSGD, RMSprop(W), and Adam(W). These SDEs offer a quantitatively accurate description of these optimizers and help illuminate an intricate relationship between adaptivity, gradient noise, and curvature. Our novel analysis of SignSGD highlights a noteworthy and precise contrast to SGD in terms of convergence speed, stationary distribution, and robustness to heavy-tail noise. We extend this analysis to AdamW and RMSpropW, for which we observe that the role of noise is much more complex. Crucially, we support our theoretical analysis with experimental evidence by verifying our insights: this includes numerically integrating our SDEs using Euler-Maruyama discretization on various neural network architectures such as MLPs, CNNs, ResNets, and Transformers. Our SDEs accurately track the behavior of the respective optimizers, especially when compared to previous SDEs derived for Adam and RMSprop. We believe our approach can provide valuable insights into best training practices and novel scaling rules.</description>

      <title>Proto Successor Measure: Representing the Behavior Space of an RL Agent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Having explored an environment, intelligent agents should be able to transfer their knowledge to most downstream tasks within that environment without additional interactions. Referred to as "zero-shot learning", this ability remains elusive for general-purpose reinforcement learning algorithms. While recent works have attempted to produce zero-shot RL agents, they make assumptions about the nature of the tasks or the structure of the MDP. We present Proto Successor Measure: the basis set for all possible behaviors of a Reinforcement Learning Agent in a dynamical system. We prove that any possible behavior (represented using visitation distributions) can be represented using an affine combination of these policy-independent basis functions. Given a reward function at test time, we simply need to find the right set of linear weights to combine these bases corresponding to the optimal policy. We derive a practical algorithm to learn these basis functions using reward-free interaction data from the environment and show that our approach can produce the optimal policy at test time for any given reward function without additional environmental interactions.

      <title>RL-MILP Solver: A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Solving Mixed-Integer Linear Programs with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19517v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is a widely used optimization technique across various fields. Existing $\textit{end-to-end learning}$ methods for MILP generate values for a subset of decision variables and delegate the remaining problem to traditional MILP solvers. However, this approach often fails to guarantee solution feasibility (i.e., satisfying all constraints) due to inaccurate predictions and primarily focuses on binary decision variables. Satisfying all constraints is a prerequisite for obtaining the optimal solution, and the feasibility issue becomes even more critical with non-binary integer (integer, for short) variables. Thus, addressing the feasibility of MILP involving integer variables is crucial. To address these challenges, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based solver that not only finds the first feasible solution but also incrementally discovers better feasible solutions without delegating the remainder to off-the-shelf solvers. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves (near-)optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>On How Iterative Magnitude Pruning Discovers Local Receptive Fields in Fully Connected Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since its use in the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) has become a popular method for extracting sparse subnetworks that can be trained to high performance. Despite its success, the mechanism that drives the success of IMP remains unclear. One possibility is that IMP is capable of extracting subnetworks with good inductive biases that facilitate performance. Supporting this idea, recent work showed that applying IMP to fully connected neural networks (FCNs) leads to the emergence of local receptive fields (RFs), a feature of mammalian visual cortex and convolutional neural networks that facilitates image processing. However, it remains unclear why IMP would uncover localized features in the first place. Inspired by results showing that training on synthetic images with highly non-Gaussian statistics (e.g., sharp edges) is sufficient to drive the emergence of local RFs in FCNs, we hypothesize that IMP iteratively increases the non-Gaussian statistics of FCN representations, creating a feedback loop that enhances localization. Here, we demonstrate first that non-Gaussian input statistics are indeed necessary for IMP to discover localized RFs. We then develop a new method for measuring the effect of individual weights on the statistics of the FCN representations ("cavity method"), which allows us to show that IMP systematically increases the non-Gaussianity of pre-activations, leading to the formation of localized RFs. Our work, which is the first to study the effect of IMP on the statistics of the representations of neural networks, sheds parsimonious light on one way in which IMP can drive the formation of strong inductive biases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An interpretable machine learning (ML) framework is introduced to enhance the diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) by ensuring robustness of the ML models' interpretations. The dataset used comprises volumetric measurements from brain MRI and genetic data from healthy individuals and patients with MCI/AD, obtained through the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The existing class imbalance is addressed by an ensemble learning approach, while various attribution-based and counterfactual-based interpretability methods are leveraged towards producing diverse explanations related to the pathophysiology of MCI/AD. A unification method combining SHAP with counterfactual explanations assesses the interpretability techniques' robustness. The best performing model yielded 87.5% balanced accuracy and 90.8% F1-score. The attribution-based interpretability methods highlighted significant volumetric and genetic features related to MCI/AD risk. The unification method provided useful insights regarding those features' necessity and sufficiency, further showcasing their significance in MCI/AD diagnosis.</description>

      <title>PCA-Featured Transformer for Jamming Detection in 5G UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) face significant security risks from jamming attacks, which can compromise network functionality. Traditional detection methods often fall short when confronting AI-powered jamming that dynamically modifies its behavior, while contemporary machine learning approaches frequently demand substantial feature engineering and struggle with temporal patterns in attack signatures. The vulnerability extends to 5G networks employing Time Division Duplex (TDD) or Frequency Division Duplex (FDD), where service quality may deteriorate due to deliberate interference. We introduce a novel U-shaped transformer architecture that leverages Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to refine feature representations for improved wireless security. The training process is regularized by incorporating the output entropy uncertainty into the loss function, a mechanism inspired by the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable robust jamming detection techniques. The architecture features a modified transformer encoder specially designed to process critical wireless signal features, including Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Signal-to- Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) measurements. We complement this with a custom positional encoding mechanism that specifically accounts for the inherent periodicity of wireless signals,enabling a more accurate representation of temporal signal patterns. In addition, we propose a batch size scheduler and implement chunking techniques to optimize convergence for time series data. These advancements contribute to up to a ten times improvement in training speed within the advanced U-shaped encoder-decoder transformer model introduced in this study. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our entropy-based approach, achieving detection rates of 85.06% in NLoS scenarios.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Mitigating Bottlenecks of State Space Models through the Lens of Recency and Over-smoothing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structured State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as alternatives to transformers. While SSMs are often regarded as effective in capturing long-sequence dependencies, we rigorously demonstrate that they are inherently limited by strong recency bias. Our empirical studies also reveal that this bias impairs the models' ability to recall distant information and introduces robustness issues. Our scaling experiments then discovered that deeper structures in SSMs can facilitate the learning of long contexts. However, subsequent theoretical analysis reveals that as SSMs increase in depth, they exhibit another inevitable tendency toward over-smoothing, e.g., token representations becoming increasingly indistinguishable. This fundamental dilemma between recency and over-smoothing hinders the scalability of existing SSMs. Inspired by our theoretical findings, we propose to polarize two channels of the state transition matrices in SSMs, setting them to zero and one, respectively, simultaneously addressing recency bias and over-smoothing. Experiments demonstrate that our polarization technique consistently enhances the associative recall accuracy of long-range tokens and unlocks SSMs to benefit further from deeper architectures.

Abstract: The prediction of solar irradiance enhances reliability in photovoltaic (PV) solar plant generation and grid integration. In Colombia, PV plants face penalties if energy production deviates beyond governmental thresholds from intraday market offers. This research employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional-LSTM (Bi-LSTM) models, utilizing meteorological data from a PV plant in El Paso, Cesar, Colombia, to predict solar irradiance with a 6-hour horizon and 10-minute resolution. While Bi-LSTM showed superior performance, the LSTM model achieved comparable results with significantly reduced training time (6 hours versus 18 hours), making it computationally advantageous. The LSTM predictions were averaged to create an hourly resolution model, evaluated using Mean Absolute Error, Root-Mean-Square Error, Normalized Root-Mean-Square Error, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error metrics. Comparison with the Global Forecast System (GFS) revealed similar performance, with both models effectively capturing daily solar irradiance patterns. The forecast model integrates with an Object-Oriented power production model, enabling accurate energy offers in the intraday market while minimizing penalty costs.</description>

      <title>Pairwise Elimination with Instance-Dependent Guarantees for Bandits with Cost Subsidy</title>

Abstract: Multi-armed bandits (MAB) are commonly used in sequential online decision-making when the reward of each decision is an unknown random variable. In practice however, the typical goal of maximizing total reward may be less important than minimizing the total cost of the decisions taken, subject to a reward constraint. For example, we may seek to make decisions that have at least the reward of a reference ``default'' decision, with as low a cost as possible. This problem was recently introduced in the Multi-Armed Bandits with Cost Subsidy (MAB-CS) framework. MAB-CS is broadly applicable to problem domains where a primary metric (cost) is constrained by a secondary metric (reward), and the rewards are unknown. In our work, we address variants of MAB-CS including ones with reward constrained by the reward of a known reference arm or by the subsidized best reward. We introduce the Pairwise-Elimination (PE) algorithm for the known reference arm variant and generalize PE to PE-CS for the subsidized best reward variant. Our instance-dependent analysis of PE and PE-CS reveals that both algorithms have an order-wise logarithmic upper bound on Cost and Quality Regret, making our policies the first with such a guarantee. Moreover, by comparing our upper and lower bound results we establish that PE is order-optimal for all known reference arm problem instances. Finally, experiments are conducted using the MovieLens 25M and Goodreads datasets for both PE and PE-CS revealing the effectiveness of PE and the superior balance between performance and reliability offered by PE-CS compared to baselines from the literature.</description>

      <title>Efficient Traffic Prediction Through Spatio-Temporal Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained considerable attention in recent years for traffic flow prediction due to their ability to learn spatio-temporal pattern representations through a graph-based message-passing framework. Although GNNs have shown great promise in handling traffic datasets, their deployment in real-life applications has been hindered by scalability constraints arising from high-order message passing. Additionally, the over-smoothing problem of GNNs may lead to indistinguishable region representations as the number of layers increases, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge distillation paradigm termed LightST that transfers spatial and temporal knowledge from a high-capacity teacher to a lightweight student. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal knowledge distillation framework that helps student MLPs capture graph-structured global spatio-temporal patterns while alleviating the over-smoothing effect with adaptive knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments verify that LightST significantly speeds up traffic flow predictions by 5X to 40X compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs, all while maintaining superior accuracy.</description>

      <title>Unified CNNs and transformers underlying learning mechanism reveals multi-head attention modus vivendi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) evaluate short-range correlations in input images which progress along the layers, whereas vision transformer (ViT) architectures evaluate long-range correlations, using repeated transformer encoders composed of fully connected layers. Both are designed to solve complex classification tasks but from different perspectives. This study demonstrates that CNNs and ViT architectures stem from a unified underlying learning mechanism, which quantitatively measures the single-nodal performance (SNP) of each node in feedforward (FF) and multi-head attention (MHA) sub-blocks. Each node identifies small clusters of possible output labels, with additional noise represented as labels outside these clusters. These features are progressively sharpened along the transformer encoders, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio. This unified underlying learning mechanism leads to two main findings. First, it enables an efficient applied nodal diagonal connection (ANDC) pruning technique without affecting the accuracy. Second, based on the SNP, spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs among the MHA heads, such that each head focuses its attention on a subset of labels through cooperation among its SNPs. Consequently, each head becomes an expert in recognizing its designated labels, representing a quantitative MHA modus vivendi mechanism. This statistical mechanics inspired viewpoint enables to reveal macroscopic behavior of the entire network from the microscopic performance of each node. These results are based on a compact convolutional transformer architecture trained on the CIFAR-100 and Flowers-102 datasets and call for their extension to other architectures and applications, such as natural language processing.</description>

      <title>KAA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention for Enhancing Attentive Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13456v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) with attention mechanisms, often referred to as attentive GNNs, have emerged as a prominent paradigm in advanced GNN models in recent years. However, our understanding of the critical process of scoring neighbor nodes remains limited, leading to the underperformance of many existing attentive GNNs. In this paper, we unify the scoring functions of current attentive GNNs and propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KAA), which integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture into the scoring process. KAA enhances the performance of scoring functions across the board and can be applied to nearly all existing attentive GNNs. To compare the expressive power of KAA with other scoring functions, we introduce Maximum Ranking Distance (MRD) to quantitatively estimate their upper bounds in ranking errors for node importance. Our analysis reveals that, under limited parameters and constraints on width and depth, both linear transformation-based and MLP-based scoring functions exhibit finite expressive power. In contrast, our proposed KAA, even with a single-layer KAN parameterized by zero-order B-spline functions, demonstrates nearly infinite expressive power. Extensive experiments on both node-level and graph-level tasks using various backbone models show that KAA-enhanced scoring functions consistently outperform their original counterparts, achieving performance improvements of over 20% in some cases.</description>

      <title>MambaQuant: Quantizing the Mamba Family with Variance Aligned Rotation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mamba is an efficient sequence model that rivals Transformers and demonstrates significant potential as a foundational architecture for various tasks. Quantization is commonly used in neural networks to reduce model size and computational latency. However, applying quantization to Mamba remains underexplored, and existing quantization methods, which have been effective for CNN and Transformer models, appear inadequate for Mamba models (e.g., Quarot suffers a 21% accuracy drop on Vim-T$^\dagger$ even under W8A8). We have pioneered the exploration of this issue and identified several key challenges. First, significant outliers are present in gate projections, output projections, and matrix multiplications. Second, Mamba's unique parallel scan further amplifies these outliers, leading to uneven and heavy-tailed data distributions. Third, even with the application of the Hadamard transform, the variance across channels in weights and activations still remains inconsistent. To these ends, we propose MambaQuant, a post-training quantization (PTQ) framework consisting of: 1) Karhunen-Loeve Transformation (KLT) enhanced rotation, rendering the rotation matrix adaptable to diverse channel distributions. 2) Smooth-Fused rotation, which equalizes channel variances and can merge additional parameters into model weights. Experiments show that MambaQuant can quantize both weights and activations into 8-bit with less than 1% accuracy loss for Mamba-based vision and language tasks. To the best of our knowledge, MambaQuant is the first comprehensive PTQ design for the Mamba family, paving the way for further advancements in its application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for optimizing the graph ratio-cut by modeling the binary assignments as random variables. We provide an upper bound on the expected ratio-cut, as well as an unbiased estimate of its gradient, to learn the parameters of the assignment variables in an online setting. The clustering resulting from our probabilistic approach (PRCut) outperforms the Rayleigh quotient relaxation of the combinatorial problem, its online learning extensions, and several widely used methods. We demonstrate that the PRCut clustering closely aligns with the similarity measure and can perform as well as a supervised classifier when label-based similarities are provided. This novel approach can leverage out-of-the-box self-supervised representations to achieve competitive performance and serve as an evaluation method for the quality of these representations.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the Most Fire-Sensitive Point in Building Structures with Differentiable Agents for Thermal Simulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fire safety is crucial for ensuring the stability of building structures, yet evaluating whether a structure meets fire safety requirement is challenging. Fires can originate at any point within a structure, and simulating every potential fire scenario is both expensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose the concept of the Most Fire-Sensitive Point (MFSP) and an efficient machine learning framework for its identification. The MFSP is defined as the location at which a fire, if initiated, would cause the most severe detrimental impact on the building's stability, effectively representing the worst-case fire scenario. In our framework, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) serves as an efficient and differentiable agent for conventional Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulators by predicting the Maximum Interstory Drift Ratio (MIDR) under fire, which then guides the training and evaluation of the MFSP predictor. Additionally, we enhance our framework with a novel edge update mechanism and a transfer learning-based training scheme. Evaluations on a large-scale simulation dataset demonstrate the good performance of the proposed framework in identifying the MFSP, offering a transformative tool for optimizing fire safety assessments in structural design. All developed datasets and codes are open-sourced online.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Regret for Online KL-Regularized Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) have shown that KL-regularization plays a pivotal role in improving the efficiency of RL fine-tuning for large language models (LLMs). Despite its empirical advantage, the theoretical difference between KL-regularized RL and standard RL remains largely under-explored. While there is a recent line of work on the theoretical analysis of KL-regularized objective in decision making \citep{xiong2024iterative, xie2024exploratory,zhao2024sharp}, these analyses either reduce to the traditional RL setting or rely on strong coverage assumptions. In this paper, we propose an optimism-based KL-regularized online contextual bandit algorithm, and provide a novel analysis of its regret. By carefully leveraging the benign optimization landscape induced by the KL-regularization and the optimistic reward estimation, our algorithm achieves an $\mathcal{O}\big(\eta\log (N_{\mathcal R} T)\cdot d_{\mathcal R}\big)$ logarithmic regret bound, where $\eta, N_{\mathcal R},T,d_{\mathcal R}$ denote the KL-regularization parameter, the cardinality of the reward function class, number of rounds, and the complexity of the reward function class. Furthermore, we extend our algorithm and analysis to reinforcement learning by developing a novel decomposition over transition steps and also obtain a similar logarithmic regret bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown considerable promise in computational chemistry. However, the limited availability of molecular data raises concerns regarding GNNs' ability to effectively capture the fundamental principles of physics and chemistry, which constrains their generalization capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel self-supervised approach termed Equivariant Masked Position Prediction (EMPP), grounded in intramolecular potential and force theory. Unlike conventional attribute masking techniques, EMPP formulates a nuanced position prediction task that is more well-defined and enhances the learning of quantum mechanical features. EMPP also bypasses the approximation of the Gaussian mixture distribution commonly used in denoising methods, allowing for more accurate acquisition of physical properties. Experimental results indicate that EMPP significantly enhances performance of advanced molecular architectures, surpassing state-of-the-art self-supervised approaches. Our code is released in https://github.com/ajy112/EMPP</description>

      <title>On the Byzantine Fault Tolerance of signSGD with Majority Vote</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In distributed learning, sign-based compression algorithms such as signSGD with majority vote provide a lightweight alternative to SGD with an additional advantage: fault tolerance (almost) for free. However, for signSGD with majority vote, this fault tolerance has been shown to cover only the case of weaker adversaries, i.e., ones that are not omniscient or cannot collude to base their attack on common knowledge and strategy. In this work, we close this gap and provide new insights into how signSGD with majority vote can be resilient against omniscient and colluding adversaries, which craft an attack after communicating with other adversaries, thus having better information to perform the most damaging attack based on a common optimal strategy. Our core contribution is in providing a proof that begins by defining the omniscience framework and the strongest possible damage against signSGD with majority vote without imposing any restrictions on the attacker. Thanks to the filtering effect of the sign-based method, we upper-bound the space of attacks to the optimal strategy for maximizing damage by an attacker. Hence, we derive an explicit probabilistic bound in terms of incorrect aggregation without resorting to unknown constants, providing a convergence bound on signSGD with majority vote in the presence of Byzantine attackers, along with a precise convergence rate. Our findings are supported by experiments on the MNIST dataset in a distributed learning environment with adversaries of varying strength.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Bridger: Towards Training-free Missing Multi-modality Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous successful approaches to missing modality completion rely on carefully designed fusion techniques and extensive pre-training on complete data, which can limit their generalizability in out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios. In this study, we pose a new challenge: can we develop a missing modality completion model that is both resource-efficient and robust to OOD generalization? To address this, we present a training-free framework for missing modality completion that leverages large multimodal models (LMMs). Our approach, termed the "Knowledge Bridger", is modality-agnostic and integrates generation and ranking of missing modalities. By defining domain-specific priors, our method automatically extracts structured information from available modalities to construct knowledge graphs. These extracted graphs connect the missing modality generation and ranking modules through the LMM, resulting in high-quality imputations of missing modalities. Experimental results across both general and medical domains show that our approach consistently outperforms competing methods, including in OOD generalization. Additionally, our knowledge-driven generation and ranking techniques demonstrate superiority over variants that directly employ LMMs for generation and ranking, offering insights that may be valuable for applications in other domains.</description>

Abstract: Pok\'emon Red, a classic Game Boy JRPG, presents significant challenges as a testbed for agents, including multi-tasking, long horizons of tens of thousands of steps, hard exploration, and a vast array of potential policies. We introduce a simplistic environment and a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) training methodology, demonstrating a baseline agent that completes an initial segment of the game up to completing Cerulean City. Our experiments include various ablations that reveal vulnerabilities in reward shaping, where agents exploit specific reward signals. We also discuss limitations and argue that games like Pok\'emon hold strong potential for future research on Large Language Model agents, hierarchical training algorithms, and advanced exploration methods.

      <title>Gradient-Guided Annealing for Domain Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) research has gained considerable traction as of late, since the ability to generalize to unseen data distributions is a requirement that eludes even state-of-the-art training algorithms. In this paper we observe that the initial iterations of model training play a key role in domain generalization effectiveness, since the loss landscape may be significantly different across the training and test distributions, contrary to the case of i.i.d. data. Conflicts between gradients of the loss components of each domain lead the optimization procedure to undesirable local minima that do not capture the domain-invariant features of the target classes. We propose alleviating domain conflicts in model optimization, by iteratively annealing the parameters of a model in the early stages of training and searching for points where gradients align between domains. By discovering a set of parameter values where gradients are updated towards the same direction for each data distribution present in the training set, the proposed Gradient-Guided Annealing (GGA) algorithm encourages models to seek out minima that exhibit improved robustness against domain shifts. The efficacy of GGA is evaluated on five widely accepted and challenging image classification domain generalization benchmarks, where its use alone is able to establish highly competitive or even state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, when combined with previously proposed domain-generalization algorithms it is able to consistently improve their effectiveness by significant margins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic interactions between entities are prevalent in domains like social platforms, financial systems, healthcare, and e-commerce. These interactions can be effectively represented as time-evolving graphs, where predicting future connections is a key task in applications such as recommendation systems. Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have achieved strong results for such predictive tasks but typically require extensive training data, which is often limited in real-world scenarios. One approach to mitigating data scarcity is leveraging pre-trained models from related datasets. However, direct knowledge transfer between TGNNs is challenging due to their reliance on node-specific memory structures, making them inherently difficult to adapt across datasets.
  To address this, we introduce a novel transfer approach that disentangles node representations from their associated features through a structured bipartite encoding mechanism. This decoupling enables more effective transfer of memory components and other learned inductive patterns from one dataset to another. Empirical evaluations on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances TGNN performance in low-data regimes, outperforming non-transfer baselines by up to 56\% and surpassing existing transfer strategies by 36\%</description>

      <title>Hierarchical graph sampling based minibatch learning with chain preservation and variance reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00860v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph sampling based Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) decouple the sampling from the forward and backward propagation during minibatch training, which exhibit good scalability in terms of layer depth and graph size. We propose HIS_GCNs, a hierarchical importance graph sampling based learning method. By constructing minibatches using sampled subgraphs, HIS_GCNs gives attention to the importance of both core and periphery nodes/edges in a scale-free training graph. Specifically, it preserves the centrum of the core to most minibatches, which maintains connectivity between periphery nodes, and samples periphery edges without core node interference, in order to keep more long chains composed entirely of low-degree nodes in the same minibatch. HIS_GCNs can maximize the discrete Ricci curvature (i.e., Ollivier-Ricci curvatures) of the edges in a subgraph that enables the preservation of important chains for information propagation, and can achieve a low node embedding variance and a high convergence speed. Diverse experiments on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with node classification tasks confirm superior performance of HIS_GCNs in both accuracy and training time.

      <title>PaCA: Partial Connection Adaptation for Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prior parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) algorithms reduce memory usage and computational costs of fine-tuning large neural network models by training only a few additional adapter parameters, rather than the entire model. However, the reduction in computational costs due to PEFT does not necessarily translate to a reduction in training time; although the computational costs of the adapter layers are much smaller than the pretrained layers, it is well known that those two types of layers are processed sequentially on GPUs, resulting in significant latency overhead. LoRA and its variants merge low-rank adapter matrices with pretrained weights during inference to avoid latency overhead, but during training, the pretrained weights remain frozen while the adapter matrices are continuously updated, preventing such merging. To mitigate this issue, we propose Partial Connection Adaptation (PaCA), which fine-tunes randomly selected partial connections within the pretrained weights instead of introducing adapter layers in the model. PaCA not only enhances training speed by eliminating the time overhead due to the sequential processing of the adapter and pretrained layers but also reduces activation memory since only partial activations, rather than full activations, need to be stored for gradient computation. Compared to LoRA, PaCA reduces training time by 22% and total memory usage by 16%, while maintaining comparable accuracy across various fine-tuning scenarios, such as fine-tuning on the MMLU dataset and instruction tuning on the Oasst1 dataset. PaCA can also be combined with quantization, enabling the fine-tuning of large models such as LLaMA3.1-70B. In addition, PaCA enables training with 23% longer sequence and improves throughput by 16% on both NVIDIA A100 GPU and INTEL Gaudi2 HPU compared to LoRA.

      <title>RAAD-LLM: Adaptive Anomaly Detection Using LLMs and RAG Integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex industrial environments poses unique challenges, particularly in contexts characterized by data sparsity and evolving operational conditions. Predictive maintenance (PdM) in such settings demands methodologies that are adaptive, transferable, and capable of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present RAAD-LLM, a novel framework for adaptive anomaly detection, leveraging large language models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time series data without requiring fine-tuning on specific datasets. The framework's adaptability mechanism enables it to adjust its understanding of normal operating conditions dynamically, thus increasing detection accuracy. We validate this methodology through a real-world application for a plastics manufacturing plant and the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). Results show significant improvements over our previous model with an accuracy increase from 70.7% to 88.6% on the real-world dataset. By allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics, RAAD-LLM incorporates multimodal capabilities that facilitate more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators. Overall, our findings support RAAD-LLM's ability to revolutionize anomaly detection methodologies in PdM, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how anomaly detection is implemented across various industries.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning Enables Parameter Scaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) aims to endow a single agent with the ability to perform well on multiple tasks. Recent works have focused on developing novel sophisticated architectures to improve performance, often resulting in larger models; it is unclear, however, whether the performance gains are a consequence of the architecture design itself or the extra parameters. We argue that gains are mostly due to scale by demonstrating that naively scaling up a simple MTRL baseline to match parameter counts outperforms the more sophisticated architectures, and these gains benefit most from scaling the critic over the actor. Additionally, we explore the training stability advantages that come with task diversity, demonstrating that increasing the number of tasks can help mitigate plasticity loss. Our findings suggest that MTRL's simultaneous training across multiple tasks provides a natural framework for beneficial parameter scaling in reinforcement learning, challenging the need for complex architectural innovations.</description>

      <title>A Transformer Model for Predicting Chemical Reaction Products from Generic Templates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of chemical reaction outcomes is a major challenge in computational chemistry. Current models rely heavily on either highly specific reaction templates or template-free methods, both of which present limitations. To address these limitations, this work proposes the Broad Reaction Set (BRS), a dataset featuring 20 generic reaction templates that allow for the efficient exploration of the chemical space. Additionally, ProPreT5 is introduced, a T5 model tailored to chemistry that achieves a balance between rigid templates and template-free methods. ProPreT5 demonstrates its capability to generate accurate, valid, and realistic reaction products, making it a promising solution that goes beyond the current state-of-the-art on the complex reaction product prediction task.</description>

      <title>Do Fairness Interventions Come at the Cost of Privacy: Evaluations for Binary Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While in-processing fairness approaches show promise in mitigating biased predictions, their potential impact on privacy leakage remains under-explored. We aim to address this gap by assessing the privacy risks of fairness-enhanced binary classifiers via membership inference attacks (MIAs) and attribute inference attacks (AIAs). Surprisingly, our results reveal that enhancing fairness does not necessarily lead to privacy compromises. For example, these fairness interventions exhibit increased resilience against MIAs and AIAs. This is because fairness interventions tend to remove sensitive information among extracted features and reduce confidence scores for the majority of training data for fairer predictions. However, during the evaluations, we uncover a potential threat mechanism that exploits prediction discrepancies between fair and biased models, leading to advanced attack results for both MIAs and AIAs. This mechanism reveals potent vulnerabilities of fair models and poses significant privacy risks of current fairness methods. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, attack methods, and representative fairness approaches confirm our findings and demonstrate the efficacy of the uncovered mechanism. Our study exposes the under-explored privacy threats in fairness studies, advocating for thorough evaluations of potential security vulnerabilities before model deployments.</description>

      <title>TiGer: Self-Supervised Purification for Time-evolving Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-evolving graphs, such as social and citation networks, often contain noise that distorts structural and temporal patterns, adversely affecting downstream tasks, such as node classification. Existing purification methods focus on static graphs, limiting their ability to account for critical temporal dependencies in dynamic graphs. In this work, we propose TiGer (Time-evolving Graph purifier), a self-supervised method explicitly designed for time-evolving graphs. TiGer assigns two different sub-scores to edges using (1) self-attention for capturing long-term contextual patterns shaped by both adjacent and distant past events of varying significance and (2) statistical distance measures for detecting inconsistency over a short-term period. These sub-scores are used to identify and filter out suspicious (i.e., noise-like) edges through an ensemble strategy, ensuring robustness without requiring noise labels. Our experiments on five real-world datasets show TiGer filters out noise with up to 10.2% higher accuracy and improves node classification performance by up to 5.3%, compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Ideas in Inference-time Scaling can Benefit Generative Pre-training Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in foundation models through generative pre-training, yet algorithmic innovation in this space has largely stagnated around autoregressive models for discrete signals and diffusion models for continuous signals. This stagnation creates a bottleneck that prevents us from fully unlocking the potential of rich multi-modal data, which in turn limits the progress on multimodal intelligence. We argue that an inference-first perspective, which prioritizes scaling efficiency during inference time across sequence length and refinement steps, can inspire novel generative pre-training algorithms. Using Inductive Moment Matching (IMM) as a concrete example, we demonstrate how addressing limitations in diffusion models' inference process through targeted modifications yields a stable, single-stage algorithm that achieves superior sample quality with over an order of magnitude greater inference efficiency.</description>

      <title>FedRand: Enhancing Privacy in Federated Learning with Randomized LoRA Subparameter Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widely used framework for training models in a decentralized manner, ensuring that the central server does not have direct access to data from local clients. However, this approach may still fail to fully preserve data privacy, as models from local clients are exposed to the central server during the aggregation process. This issue becomes even more critical when training vision-language models (VLMs) with FL, as VLMs can easily memorize training data instances, making them vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs). To address this challenge, we propose the FedRand framework, which avoids disclosing the full set of client parameters. In this framework, each client randomly selects subparameters of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) from the server and keeps the remaining counterparts of the LoRA weights as private parameters. After training both parameters on the client's private dataset, only the non-private client parameters are sent back to the server for aggregation. This approach mitigates the risk of exposing client-side VLM parameters, thereby enhancing data privacy. We empirically validate that FedRand improves robustness against MIAs compared to relevant baselines while achieving accuracy comparable to methods that communicate full LoRA parameters across several benchmark datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models and Flow Matching generate high-quality samples but are slow at inference, and distilling them into few-step models often leads to instability and extensive tuning. To resolve these trade-offs, we propose Inductive Moment Matching (IMM), a new class of generative models for one- or few-step sampling with a single-stage training procedure. Unlike distillation, IMM does not require pre-training initialization and optimization of two networks; and unlike Consistency Models, IMM guarantees distribution-level convergence and remains stable under various hyperparameters and standard model architectures. IMM surpasses diffusion models on ImageNet-256x256 with 1.99 FID using only 8 inference steps and achieves state-of-the-art 2-step FID of 1.98 on CIFAR-10 for a model trained from scratch.</description>

Abstract: We present Preserving Clusters and Correlations (PCC), a novel dimensionality reduction (DR) method a novel dimensionality reduction (DR) method that achieves state-of-the-art global structure (GS) preservation while maintaining competitive local structure (LS) preservation. It optimizes two objectives: a GS preservation objective that preserves an approximation of Pearson and Spearman correlations between high- and low-dimensional distances, and an LS preservation objective that ensures clusters in the high-dimensional data are separable in the low-dimensional data. PCC has a state-of-the-art ability to preserve the GS while having competitive LS preservation. In addition, we show the correlation objective can be combined with UMAP to significantly improve its GS preservation with minimal degradation of the LS. We quantitatively benchmark PCC against existing methods and demonstrate its utility in medical imaging, and show PCC is a competitive DR technique that demonstrates superior GS preservation in our benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Minimax Estimation for Personalized Federated Learning: An Alternative between FedAvg and Local Training?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.01901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A widely recognized difficulty in federated learning arises from the statistical heterogeneity among clients: local datasets often originate from distinct yet not entirely unrelated probability distributions, and personalization is, therefore, necessary to achieve optimal results from each individual's perspective. In this paper, we show how the excess risks of personalized federated learning using a smooth, strongly convex loss depend on data heterogeneity from a minimax point of view, with a focus on the FedAvg algorithm (McMahan et al., 2017) and pure local training (i.e., clients solve empirical risk minimization problems on their local datasets without any communication). Our main result reveals an approximate alternative between these two baseline algorithms for federated learning: the former algorithm is minimax rate optimal over a collection of instances when data heterogeneity is small, whereas the latter is minimax rate optimal when data heterogeneity is large, and the threshold is sharp up to a constant.
  As an implication, our results show that from a worst-case point of view, a dichotomous strategy that makes a choice between the two baseline algorithms is rate-optimal. Another implication is that the popular FedAvg following by local fine tuning strategy is also minimax optimal under additional regularity conditions. Our analysis relies on a new notion of algorithmic stability that takes into account the nature of federated learning.</description>

      <title>A Deterministic Sampling Method via Maximum Mean Discrepancy Flow with Adaptive Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel deterministic sampling method to approximate a target distribution $\rho^*$ by minimizing the kernel discrepancy, also known as the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). By employing the general \emph{energetic variational inference} framework (Wang et al., 2021), we convert the problem of minimizing MMD to solving a dynamic ODE system of the particles. We adopt the implicit Euler numerical scheme to solve the ODE systems. This leads to a proximal minimization problem in each iteration of updating the particles, which can be solved by optimization algorithms such as L-BFGS. The proposed method is named EVI-MMD. To overcome the long-existing issue of bandwidth selection of the Gaussian kernel, we propose a novel way to specify the bandwidth dynamically. Through comprehensive numerical studies, we have shown the proposed adaptive bandwidth significantly improves the EVI-MMD. We use the EVI-MMD algorithm to solve two types of sampling problems. In the first type, the target distribution is given by a fully specified density function. The second type is a "two-sample problem", where only training data are available. The EVI-MMD method is used as a generative learning model to generate new samples that follow the same distribution as the training data. With the recommended settings of the tuning parameters, we show that the proposed EVI-MMD method outperforms some existing methods for both types of problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.02625v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of learning a machine learning model from training data that originates at multiple data owners while providing formal privacy guarantees regarding the protection of each owner's data. Existing solutions based on Differential Privacy (DP) achieve this at the cost of a drop in accuracy. Solutions based on Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) do not incur such accuracy loss but leak information when the trained model is made publicly available. We propose an MPC solution for training DP models. Our solution relies on an MPC protocol for model training, and an MPC protocol for perturbing the trained model coefficients with Laplace noise in a privacy-preserving manner. The resulting MPC+DP approach achieves higher accuracy than a pure DP approach while providing the same formal privacy guarantees. Our work obtained first place in the iDASH2021 Track III competition on confidential computing for secure genome analysis.</description>

      <title>Computing high-dimensional optimal transport by flow neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11857v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing optimal transport (OT) for general high-dimensional data has been a long-standing challenge. Despite much progress, most of the efforts including neural network methods have been focused on the static formulation of the OT problem. The current work proposes to compute the dynamic OT between two arbitrary distributions $P$ and $Q$ by optimizing a flow model, where both distributions are only accessible via finite samples. Our method learns the dynamic OT by finding an invertible flow that minimizes the transport cost. The trained optimal transport flow subsequently allows for performing many downstream tasks, including infinitesimal density ratio estimation (DRE) and domain adaptation by interpolating distributions in the latent space. The effectiveness of the proposed model on high-dimensional data is demonstrated by strong empirical performance on OT baselines, image-to-image translation, and high-dimensional DRE.</description>

      <title>Statistical Guarantees of Group-Invariant GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13517v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents the first statistical performance guarantees for group-invariant generative models. Many real data, such as images and molecules, are invariant to certain group symmetries, which can be taken advantage of to learn more efficiently as we rigorously demonstrate in this work. Here we specifically study generative adversarial networks (GANs), and quantify the gains when incorporating symmetries into the model. Group-invariant GANs are a type of GANs in which the generators and discriminators are hardwired with group symmetries. Empirical studies have shown that these networks are capable of learning group-invariant distributions with significantly improved data efficiency. In this study, we aim to rigorously quantify this improvement by analyzing the reduction in sample complexity and in the discriminator approximation error for group-invariant GANs. Our findings indicate that when learning group-invariant distributions, the number of samples required for group-invariant GANs decreases proportionally by a factor of the group size and the discriminator approximation error has a reduced lower bound. Importantly, the overall error reduction cannot be achieved merely through data augmentation on the training data. Numerical results substantiate our theory and highlight the stark contrast between learning with group-invariant GANs and using data augmentation. This work also sheds light on the study of other generative models with group symmetries, such as score-based generative models.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Architecture Frameworks by Including Modern Stakeholders and their Views/Viewpoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05239v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various architecture frameworks for software, systems, and enterprises have been proposed in the literature. They identified several stakeholders and defined modeling perspectives, architecture viewpoints, and views to frame and address stakeholder concerns. However, the stakeholders with data science and Machine Learning (ML) related concerns, such as data scientists and data engineers, are yet to be included in existing architecture frameworks. Only this way can we envision a holistic system architecture description of an ML-enabled system. Note that the ML component behavior and functionalities are special and should be distinguished from traditional software system behavior and functionalities. The main reason is that the actual functionality should be inferred from data instead of being specified at design time. Additionally, the structural models of ML components, such as ML model architectures, are typically specified using different notations and formalisms from what the Software Engineering (SE) community uses for software structural models. Yet, these two aspects, namely ML and non-ML, are becoming so intertwined that it necessitates an extension of software architecture frameworks and modeling practices toward supporting ML-enabled system architectures. In this paper, we address this gap through an empirical study using an online survey instrument. We surveyed 61 subject matter experts from over 25 organizations in 10 countries.</description>

      <title>Transformers are Provably Optimal In-context Estimators for Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00226v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained transformers exhibit the capability of adapting to new tasks through in-context learning (ICL), where they efficiently utilize a limited set of prompts without explicit model optimization. The canonical communication problem of estimating transmitted symbols from received observations can be modeled as an in-context learning problem: received observations are a noisy function of transmitted symbols, and this function can be represented by an unknown parameter whose statistics depend on an unknown latent context. This problem, which we term in-context estimation (ICE), has significantly greater complexity than the extensively studied linear regression problem. The optimal solution to the ICE problem is a non-linear function of the underlying context. In this paper, we prove that, for a subclass of such problems, a single-layer softmax attention transformer (SAT) computes the optimal solution of the above estimation problem in the limit of large prompt length. We also prove that the optimal configuration of such a transformer is indeed the minimizer of the corresponding training loss. Further, we empirically demonstrate the proficiency of multi-layer transformers in efficiently solving broader in-context estimation problems. Through extensive simulations, we show that solving ICE problems using transformers significantly outperforms standard approaches. Moreover, just with a few context examples, it achieves the same performance as an estimator with perfect knowledge of the latent context.

      <title>Regularization by Texts for Latent Diffusion Inverse Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent development of diffusion models has led to significant progress in solving inverse problems by leveraging these models as powerful generative priors. However, challenges persist due to the ill-posed nature of such problems, often arising from ambiguities in measurements or intrinsic system symmetries. To address this, here we introduce a novel latent diffusion inverse solver, regularization by text (TReg), inspired by the human ability to resolve visual ambiguities through perceptual biases. TReg integrates textual descriptions of preconceptions about the solution during reverse diffusion sampling, dynamically reinforcing these descriptions through null-text optimization, which we refer to as adaptive negation. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that TReg effectively mitigates ambiguity in inverse problems, improving both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Multiple Testing of Linear Forms for Noisy Matrix Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many important tasks of large-scale recommender systems can be naturally cast as testing multiple linear forms for noisy matrix completion. These problems, however, present unique challenges because of the subtle bias-and-variance tradeoff of and an intricate dependence among the estimated entries induced by the low-rank structure. In this paper, we develop a general approach to overcome these difficulties by introducing new statistics for individual tests with sharp asymptotics both marginally and jointly, and utilizing them to control the false discovery rate (FDR) via a data splitting and symmetric aggregation scheme. We show that valid FDR control can be achieved with guaranteed power under nearly optimal sample size requirements using the proposed methodology. Extensive numerical simulations and real data examples are also presented to further illustrate its practical merits.</description>

      <title>Out-of-distribution robustness for multivariate analysis via causal regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a regularisation strategy of classical machine learning algorithms rooted in causality that ensures robustness against distribution shifts. Building upon the anchor regression framework, we demonstrate how incorporating a straightforward regularisation term into the loss function of classical multivariate analysis algorithms, such as (orthonormalized) partial least squares, reduced-rank regression, and multiple linear regression, enables out-of-distribution generalisation. Our framework allows users to efficiently verify the compatibility of a loss function with the regularisation strategy. Estimators for selected algorithms are provided, showcasing consistency and efficacy in synthetic and real-world climate science problems. The empirical validation highlights the versatility of anchor regularisation, emphasizing its compatibility with multivariate analysis approaches and its role in enhancing replicability while guarding against distribution shifts. The extended anchor framework advances causal inference methodologies, addressing the need for reliable out-of-distribution generalisation.</description>

      <title>INPC: Implicit Neural Point Clouds for Radiance Field Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for reconstruction and novel view synthesis of unbounded real-world scenes. In contrast to previous methods using either volumetric fields, grid-based models, or discrete point cloud proxies, we propose a hybrid scene representation, which implicitly encodes the geometry in a continuous octree-based probability field and view-dependent appearance in a multi-resolution hash grid. This allows for extraction of arbitrary explicit point clouds, which can be rendered using rasterization. In doing so, we combine the benefits of both worlds and retain favorable behavior during optimization: Our novel implicit point cloud representation and differentiable bilinear rasterizer enable fast rendering while preserving the fine geometric detail captured by volumetric neural fields. Furthermore, this representation does not depend on priors like structure-from-motion point clouds. Our method achieves state-of-the-art image quality on common benchmarks. Furthermore, we achieve fast inference at interactive frame rates, and can convert our trained model into a large, explicit point cloud to further enhance performance.</description>

      <title>RealmDreamer: Text-Driven 3D Scene Generation with Inpainting and Depth Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce RealmDreamer, a technique for generating forward-facing 3D scenes from text descriptions. Our method optimizes a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation to match complex text prompts using pretrained diffusion models. Our key insight is to leverage 2D inpainting diffusion models conditioned on an initial scene estimate to provide low variance supervision for unknown regions during 3D distillation. In conjunction, we imbue high-fidelity geometry with geometric distillation from a depth diffusion model, conditioned on samples from the inpainting model. We find that the initialization of the optimization is crucial, and provide a principled methodology for doing so. Notably, our technique doesn't require video or multi-view data and can synthesize various high-quality 3D scenes in different styles with complex layouts. Further, the generality of our method allows 3D synthesis from a single image. As measured by a comprehensive user study, our method outperforms all existing approaches, preferred by 88-95%.

      <title>OTCXR: Rethinking Self-supervised Alignment using Optimal Transport for Chest X-ray Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11868v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising technique for analyzing medical modalities such as X-rays due to its ability to learn without annotations. However, conventional SSL methods face challenges in achieving semantic alignment and capturing subtle details, which limits their ability to accurately represent the underlying anatomical structures and pathological features. To address these limitations, we propose OTCXR, a novel SSL framework that leverages optimal transport (OT) to learn dense semantic invariance. By integrating OT with our innovative Cross-Viewpoint Semantics Infusion Module (CV-SIM), OTCXR enhances the model's ability to capture not only local spatial features but also global contextual dependencies across different viewpoints. This approach enriches the effectiveness of SSL in the context of chest radiographs. Furthermore, OTCXR incorporates variance and covariance regularizations within the OT framework to prioritize clinically relevant information while suppressing less informative features. This ensures that the learned representations are comprehensive and discriminative, particularly beneficial for tasks such as thoracic disease diagnosis. We validate OTCXR's efficacy through comprehensive experiments on three publicly available chest X-ray datasets. Our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of OTCXR over state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks, confirming its capability to learn semantically rich representations.</description>

      <title>Curriculum Direct Preference Optimization for Diffusion and Consistency Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an effective and efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In this paper, we propose a novel and enhanced version of DPO based on curriculum learning for text-to-image generation. Our method is divided into two training stages. First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained by employing a reward model. Then, increasingly difficult pairs of examples are sampled and provided to a text-to-image generative (diffusion or consistency) model. Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to form easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In other words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of difficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their difficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model. Our approach, Curriculum DPO, is compared against state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference. Our code is available at https://github.com/CroitoruAlin/Curriculum-DPO.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Infinite-Horizon Average-Reward Linear MDPs via Approximation by Discounted-Reward MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15050v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of infinite-horizon average-reward reinforcement learning with linear Markov decision processes (MDPs). The associated Bellman operator of the problem not being a contraction makes the algorithm design challenging. Previous approaches either suffer from computational inefficiency or require strong assumptions on dynamics, such as ergodicity, for achieving a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$. In this paper, we propose the first algorithm that achieves $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with computational complexity polynomial in the problem parameters, without making strong assumptions on dynamics. Our approach approximates the average-reward setting by a discounted MDP with a carefully chosen discounting factor, and then applies an optimistic value iteration. We propose an algorithmic structure that plans for a nonstationary policy through optimistic value iteration and follows that policy until a specified information metric in the collected data doubles. Additionally, we introduce a value function clipping procedure for limiting the span of the value function for sample efficiency.</description>

      <title>Mean-Variance Portfolio Selection in Long-Term Investments with Unknown Distribution: Online Estimation, Risk Aversion under Ambiguity, and Universality of Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard approach for constructing a Mean-Variance portfolio involves estimating parameters for the model using collected samples. However, since the distribution of future data may not resemble that of the training set, the out-of-sample performance of the estimated portfolio is worse than one derived with true parameters, which has prompted several innovations for better estimation. Instead of treating the data without a timing aspect as in the common training-backtest approach, this paper adopts a perspective where data gradually and continuously reveal over time. The original model is recast into an online learning framework, which is free from any statistical assumptions, to propose a dynamic strategy of sequential portfolios such that its empirical utility, Sharpe ratio, and growth rate asymptotically achieve those of the true portfolio, derived with perfect knowledge of the future data.
  When the distribution of future data follows a normal shape, the growth rate of wealth is shown to increase by lifting the portfolio along the efficient frontier through the calibration of risk aversion. Since risk aversion cannot be appropriately predetermined, another proposed algorithm updates this coefficient over time, forming a dynamic strategy that approaches the optimal empirical Sharpe ratio or growth rate associated with the true coefficient. The performance of these proposed strategies can be universally guaranteed under stationary stochastic markets. Furthermore, in certain time-reversible stochastic markets, the so-called Bayesian strategy utilizing true conditional distributions, based on past market information during investment, does not perform better than the proposed strategies in terms of empirical utility, Sharpe ratio, or growth rate, which, in contrast, do not rely on conditional distributions.</description>

      <title>ClimDetect: A Benchmark Dataset for Climate Change Detection and Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting and attributing temperature increases driven by climate change is crucial for understanding global warming and informing adaptation strategies. However, distinguishing human-induced climate signals from natural variability remains challenging for traditional detection and attribution (D&amp;A) methods, which rely on identifying specific "fingerprints" -- spatial patterns expected to emerge from external forcings such as greenhouse gas emissions. Deep learning offers promise in discerning these complex patterns within expansive spatial datasets, yet the lack of standardized protocols has hindered consistent comparisons across studies.
  To address this gap, we introduce ClimDetect, a standardized dataset comprising 1.17M daily climate snapshots paired with target climate change indicator variables. The dataset is curated from both CMIP6 climate model simulations and real-world observation-assimilated reanalysis datasets (ERA5, JRA-3Q, and MERRA-2), and is designed to enhance model accuracy in detecting climate change signals. ClimDetect integrates various input and target variables used in previous research, ensuring comparability and consistency across studies. We also explore the application of vision transformers (ViT) to climate data -- a novel approach that, to our knowledge, has not been attempted before for climate change detection tasks. Our open-access data serve as a benchmark for advancing climate science by enabling end-to-end model development and evaluation. ClimDetect is publicly accessible via Hugging Face dataset repository at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ClimDetect/ClimDetect.</description>

      <title>Statistical and Geometrical properties of regularized Kernel Kullback-Leibler divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the statistical and geometrical properties of the Kullback-Leibler divergence with kernel covariance operators (KKL) introduced by Bach [2022]. Unlike the classical Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence that involves density ratios, the KKL compares probability distributions through covariance operators (embeddings) in a reproducible kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and compute the Kullback-Leibler quantum divergence. This novel divergence hence shares parallel but different aspects with both the standard Kullback-Leibler between probability distributions and kernel embeddings metrics such as the maximum mean discrepancy. A limitation faced with the original KKL divergence is its inability to be defined for distributions with disjoint supports. To solve this problem, we propose in this paper a regularised variant that guarantees that the divergence is well defined for all distributions. We derive bounds that quantify the deviation of the regularised KKL to the original one, as well as finite-sample bounds. In addition, we provide a closed-form expression for the regularised KKL, specifically applicable when the distributions consist of finite sets of points, which makes it implementable. Furthermore, we derive a Wasserstein gradient descent scheme of the KKL divergence in the case of discrete distributions, and study empirically its properties to transport a set of points to a target distribution.</description>

      <title>A Practical Theory of Generalization in Selectivity Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Query-driven machine learning models have emerged as a promising estimation technique for query selectivities. Yet, surprisingly little is known about the efficacy of these techniques from a theoretical perspective, as there exist substantial gaps between practical solutions and state-of-the-art (SOTA) theory based on the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gaps between theory and practice. First, we demonstrate that selectivity predictors induced by signed measures are learnable, which relaxes the reliance on probability measures in SOTA theory. More importantly, beyond the PAC learning framework (which only allows us to characterize how the model behaves when both training and test workloads are drawn from the same distribution), we establish, under mild assumptions, that selectivity predictors from this class exhibit favorable out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization error bounds.
  These theoretical advances provide us with a better understanding of both the in-distribution and OOD generalization capabilities of query-driven selectivity learning, and facilitate the design of two general strategies to improve OOD generalization for existing query-driven selectivity models. We empirically verify that our techniques help query-driven selectivity models generalize significantly better to OOD queries both in terms of prediction accuracy and query latency performance, while maintaining their superior in-distribution generalization performance.</description>

      <title>What Information Contributes to Log-based Anomaly Detection? Insights from a Configurable Transformer-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Log data are generated from logging statements in the source code, providing insights into the execution processes of software applications and systems. State-of-the-art log-based anomaly detection approaches typically leverage deep learning models to capture the semantic or sequential information in the log data and detect anomalous runtime behaviors. However, the impacts of these different types of information are not clear. In addition, most existing approaches ignore the timestamps in log data, which can potentially provide fine-grained sequential and temporal information. In this work, we propose a configurable Transformer-based anomaly detection model that can capture the semantic, sequential, and temporal information in the log data and allows us to configure the different types of information as the model's features. Additionally, we train and evaluate the proposed model using log sequences of different lengths, thus overcoming the constraint of existing methods that rely on fixed-length or time-windowed log sequences as inputs. With the proposed model, we conduct a series of experiments with different combinations of input features to evaluate the roles of different types of information in anomaly detection. The model can attain competitive and consistently stable performance compared to the baselines when presented with log sequences of varying lengths. The results indicate that the event occurrence information plays a key role in identifying anomalies, while the impact of the sequential and temporal information is not significant for anomaly detection on the studied public datasets. On the other hand, the findings also reveal the simplicity of the studied public datasets and highlight the importance of constructing new datasets that contain different types of anomalies to better evaluate the performance of anomaly detection models.</description>

      <title>Agent-Oriented Planning in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through the collaboration of multiple LLM-empowered agents possessing diverse expertise and tools, multi-agent systems achieve impressive progress in solving real-world problems. Given the user queries, the meta-agents, serving as the brain within multi-agent systems, are required to decompose the queries into multiple sub-tasks that can be allocated to suitable agents capable of solving them, so-called agent-oriented planning. In this study, we identify three critical design principles of agent-oriented planning, including solvability, completeness, and non-redundancy, to ensure that each sub-task can be effectively resolved, resulting in satisfactory responses to user queries. These principles further inspire us to propose AOP, a novel framework for agent-oriented planning in multi-agent systems, leveraging a fast task decomposition and allocation process followed by an effective and efficient evaluation via a reward model. According to the evaluation results, the meta-agent is also responsible for promptly making necessary adjustments to sub-tasks and scheduling. Besides, we integrate a feedback loop into AOP to further enhance the effectiveness and robustness of such a problem-solving process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advancement of AOP in solving real-world problems compared to both single-agent systems and existing planning strategies for multi-agent systems.

      <title>Task-Adaptive Pretrained Language Models via Clustered-Importance Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Specialist language models (LMs) focus on a specific task or domain on which they often outperform generalist LMs of the same size. However, the specialist data needed to pretrain these models is only available in limited amount for most tasks. In this work, we build specialist models from large generalist training sets instead. We propose a novel method, ClusteRed Importance SamPling (CRISP). CRISP clusters the generalist dataset and samples from these clusters based on their frequencies in the smaller specialist dataset. It is scalable, suitable for both pretraining and continued pretraining, and works well in multi-task settings. CRISP performs favorably compared to other methods that adjust the training distribution of the generalist data with guidance from the limited domain-specific data. Our findings demonstrate improvements across different domains in terms of language modeling perplexity and accuracy on multiple-choice question tasks. We also present ablation studies that examine the impact of dataset sizes, clustering configurations, and model sizes.</description>

      <title>Online Control-Informed Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an Online Control-Informed Learning (OCIL) framework, which employs the well-established optimal control and state estimation techniques in the field of control to solve a broad class of learning tasks in an online fashion. This novel integration effectively handles practical issues in machine learning such as noisy measurement data, online learning, and data efficiency. By considering any robot as a tunable optimal control system, we propose an online parameter estimator based on extended Kalman filter (EKF) to incrementally tune the system in an online fashion, enabling it to complete designated learning or control tasks. The proposed method also improves the robustness in learning by effectively managing noise in the data. Theoretical analysis is provided to demonstrate the convergence of OCIL. Three learning modes of OCIL, i.e. Online Imitation Learning, Online System Identification, and Policy Tuning On-the-fly, are investigated via experiments, which validate their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Taylor Unswift: Secured Weight Release for Large Language Models via Taylor Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the security of released large language models (LLMs) poses a significant dilemma, as existing mechanisms either compromise ownership rights or raise data privacy concerns. To address this dilemma, we introduce TaylorMLP to protect the ownership of released LLMs and prevent their abuse. Specifically, TaylorMLP preserves the ownership of LLMs by transforming the weights of LLMs into parameters of Taylor-series. Instead of releasing the original weights, developers can release the Taylor-series parameters with users, thereby ensuring the security of LLMs. Moreover, TaylorMLP can prevent abuse of LLMs by adjusting the generation speed. It can induce low-speed token generation for the protected LLMs by increasing the terms in the Taylor-series. This intentional delay helps LLM developers prevent potential large-scale unauthorized uses of their models. Empirical experiments across five datasets and three LLM architectures demonstrate that TaylorMLP induces over 4x increase in latency, producing the tokens precisely matched with original LLMs. Subsequent defensive experiments further confirm that TaylorMLP effectively prevents users from reconstructing the weight values based on downstream datasets.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Few-Shot Learning: a Generative Transfer Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most existing studies on few-shot learning focus on unimodal settings, where models are trained to generalize to unseen data using a limited amount of labeled examples from a single modality. However, real-world data are inherently multi-modal, and such unimodal approaches limit the practical applications of few-shot learning. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces the Cross-modal Few-Shot Learning (CFSL) task, which aims to recognize instances across multiple modalities while relying on scarce labeled data. This task presents unique challenges compared to classical few-shot learning arising from the distinct visual attributes and structural disparities inherent to each modality. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Generative Transfer Learning (GTL) framework by simulating how humans abstract and generalize concepts. Specifically, the GTL jointly estimates the latent shared concept across modalities and the in-modality disturbance through a generative structure. Establishing the relationship between latent concepts and visual content among abundant unimodal data enables GTL to effectively transfer knowledge from unimodal to novel multimodal data, as humans did. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the GTL achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven multi-modal datasets across RGB-Sketch, RGB-Infrared, and RGB-Depth.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference in Location-Scale Families: Exact Recovery of the Mean and Correlation Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an intractable target density $p$, variational inference (VI) attempts to find the best approximation $q$ from a tractable family $Q$. This is typically done by minimizing the exclusive Kullback-Leibler divergence, $\text{KL}(q||p)$. In practice, $Q$ is not rich enough to contain $p$, and the approximation is misspecified even when it is a unique global minimizer of $\text{KL}(q||p)$. In this paper, we analyze the robustness of VI to these misspecifications when $p$ exhibits certain symmetries and $Q$ is a location-scale family that shares these symmetries. We prove strong guarantees for VI not only under mild regularity conditions but also in the face of severe misspecifications. Namely, we show that (i) VI recovers the mean of $p$ when $p$ exhibits an \textit{even} symmetry, and (ii) it recovers the correlation matrix of $p$ when in addition~$p$ exhibits an \textit{elliptical} symmetry. These guarantees hold for the mean even when $q$ is factorized and $p$ is not, and for the correlation matrix even when~$q$ and~$p$ behave differently in their tails. We analyze various regimes of Bayesian inference where these symmetries are useful idealizations, and we also investigate experimentally how VI behaves in their absence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Testing and validating Autonomous Vehicle (AV) performance in safety-critical and diverse scenarios is crucial before real-world deployment. However, manually creating such scenarios in simulation remains a significant and time-consuming challenge. This work introduces a novel method that generates dynamic temporal scene graphs corresponding to diverse traffic scenarios, on-demand, tailored to user-defined preferences, such as AV actions, sets of dynamic agents, and criticality levels. A temporal Graph Neural Network (GNN) model learns to predict relationships between ego-vehicle, agents, and static structures, guided by real-world spatiotemporal interaction patterns and constrained by an ontology that restricts predictions to semantically valid links. Our model consistently outperforms the baselines in accurately generating links corresponding to the requested scenarios. We render the predicted scenarios in simulation to further demonstrate their effectiveness as testing environments for AV agents.</description>

      <title>LLM-HDR: Bridging LLM-based Perception and Self-Supervision for Unpaired LDR-to-HDR Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The translation of Low Dynamic Range (LDR) to High Dynamic Range (HDR) images is an important computer vision task. There is a significant amount of research utilizing both conventional non-learning methods and modern data-driven approaches, focusing on using both single-exposed and multi-exposed LDR for HDR image reconstruction. However, most current state-of-the-art methods require high-quality paired {LDR,HDR} datasets for model training. In addition, there is limited literature on using unpaired datasets for this task, that is, the model learns a mapping between domains, i.e., {LDR,HDR}. This paper proposes LLM-HDR, a method that integrates the perception of Large Language Models (LLM) into a modified semantic- and cycle-consistent adversarial architecture that utilizes unpaired {LDR,HDR} datasets for training. The method introduces novel artifact- and exposure-aware generators to address visual artifact removal and an encoder and loss to address semantic consistency, another under-explored topic. LLM-HDR is the first to use an LLM for the {LDR,HDR} translation task in a self-supervised setup. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance across several benchmark datasets and reconstructs high-quality HDR images.

      <title>HACSurv: A Hierarchical Copula-Based Approach for Survival Analysis with Dependent Competing Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In survival analysis, subjects often face competing risks; for example, individuals with cancer may also suffer from heart disease or other illnesses, which can jointly influence the prognosis of risks and censoring. Traditional survival analysis methods often treat competing risks as independent and fail to accommodate the dependencies between different conditions. In this paper, we introduce HACSurv, a survival analysis method that learns Hierarchical Archimedean Copulas structures and cause-specific survival functions from data with competing risks. HACSurv employs a flexible dependency structure using hierarchical Archimedean copulas to represent the relationships between competing risks and censoring. By capturing the dependencies between risks and censoring, HACSurv improves the accuracy of survival predictions and offers insights into risk interactions. Experiments on synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method can accurately identify the complex dependency structure and precisely predict survival distributions, whereas the compared methods exhibit significant deviations between their predictions and the true distributions. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets also demonstrate that our method achieves better survival prediction compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Conditional diffusions for neural posterior estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a simulation-based computational approach for Bayesian inference, has shown great success in approximating complex posterior distributions. Existing NPE methods typically rely on normalizing flows, which approximate a distribution by composing many simple, invertible transformations. But flow-based models, while state of the art for NPE, are known to suffer from several limitations, including training instability and sharp trade-offs between representational power and computational cost. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of conditional diffusions coupled with high-capacity summary networks for amortized NPE. Conditional diffusions address many of the challenges faced by flow-based methods. Our results show that, across a highly varied suite of benchmarking problems for NPE architectures, diffusions offer improved stability, superior accuracy, and faster training times, even with simpler, shallower models. Building on prior work on diffusions for NPE, we show that these gains persist across a variety of different summary network architectures.

      <title>Functional Brain Network Identification in Opioid Use Disorder Using Machine Learning Analysis of Resting-State fMRI BOLD Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19147v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the neurobiology of opioid use disorder (OUD) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) may help inform treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes. Recent literature suggests time-frequency characteristics of rs-fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals may offer complementary information to traditional analysis techniques. However, existing studies of OUD analyze BOLD signals using measures computed across all time points. This study, for the first time in the literature, employs data-driven machine learning (ML) for time-frequency analysis of local neural activity within key functional networks to differentiate OUD subjects from healthy controls (HC). We obtain time-frequency features based on rs-fMRI BOLD signals from the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN) for 31 OUD and 45 HC subjects. Then, we perform 5-fold cross-validation classification (OUD vs. HC) experiments to study the discriminative power of functional network features while taking into consideration significant demographic features. The DMN and SN show the most discriminative power, significantly (p &lt; 0.05) outperforming chance baselines with mean F1 scores of 0.7097 and 0.7018, respectively, and mean AUCs of 0.8378 and 0.8755, respectively. Follow-up Boruta ML analysis of selected time-frequency (wavelet) features reveals significant (p &lt; 0.05) detail coefficients for all three functional networks, underscoring the need for ML and time-frequency analysis of rs-fMRI BOLD signals in the study of OUD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scalable kinetic Langevin dynamics algorithm for sampling parameter spaces of big data and AI applications. Our scheme combines a symmetric forward/backward sweep over minibatches with a symmetric discretization of Langevin dynamics. For a particular Langevin splitting method (UBU), we show that the resulting Symmetric Minibatch Splitting-UBU (SMS-UBU) integrator has bias $O(h^2 d^{1/2})$ in dimension $d&gt;0$ with stepsize $h&gt;0$, despite only using one minibatch per iteration, thus providing excellent control of the sampling bias as a function of the stepsize. We apply the algorithm to explore local modes of the posterior distribution of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and evaluate the calibration performance of the posterior predictive probabilities for neural networks with convolutional neural network architectures for classification problems on three different datasets (Fashion-MNIST, Celeb-A and chest X-ray). Our results indicate that BNNs sampled with SMS-UBU can offer significantly better calibration performance compared to standard methods of training and stochastic weight averaging.</description>

      <title>FreeGaussian: Annotation-free Controllable 3D Gaussian Splats with Flow Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing controllable Gaussian splats from monocular video is a challenging task due to its inherently insufficient constraints. Widely adopted approaches supervise complex interactions with additional masks and control signal annotations, limiting their real-world applications. In this paper, we propose an annotation guidance-free method, dubbed FreeGaussian, that mathematically derives dynamic Gaussian motion from optical flow and camera motion using novel dynamic Gaussian constraints. By establishing a connection between 2D flows and 3D Gaussian dynamic control, our method enables self-supervised optimization and continuity of dynamic Gaussian motions from flow priors. Furthermore, we introduce a 3D spherical vector controlling scheme, which represents the state with a 3D Gaussian trajectory, thereby eliminating the need for complex 1D control signal calculations and simplifying controllable Gaussian modeling. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art visual performance and control capability of our method.

      <title>Minimum Empirical Divergence for Sub-Gaussian Linear Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel linear bandit algorithm called LinMED (Linear Minimum Empirical Divergence), which is a linear extension of the MED algorithm that was originally designed for multi-armed bandits. LinMED is a randomized algorithm that admits a closed-form computation of the arm sampling probabilities, unlike the popular randomized algorithm called linear Thompson sampling. Such a feature proves useful for off-policy evaluation where the unbiased evaluation requires accurately computing the sampling probability. We prove that LinMED enjoys a near-optimal regret bound of $d\sqrt{n}$ up to logarithmic factors where $d$ is the dimension and $n$ is the time horizon. We further show that LinMED enjoys a $\frac{d^2}{\Delta}\left(\log^2(n)\right)\log\left(\log(n)\right)$ problem-dependent regret where $\Delta$ is the smallest sub-optimality gap. Our empirical study shows that LinMED has a competitive performance with the state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks viewpoint for solving the Dyson-Schwinger equations of quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are employed to solve the Dyson--Schwinger equations of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in Euclidean space, with a focus on the non-perturbative generation of the fermion's dynamical mass function in the Landau gauge. By inserting the integral equation directly into the loss function, our PINN framework enables a single neural network to learn a continuous and differentiable representation of the mass function over a spectrum of momenta. Also, we benchmark our approach against a traditional numerical algorithm showing the main differences among them. Our novel strategy, which can be extended to other quantum field theories, paves the way for forefront applications of machine learning in high-level theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Smoothing in Saliency Maps: The Stability-Fidelity Trade-Off in Neural Network Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Saliency maps have been widely used to interpret the decisions of neural network classifiers and discover phenomena from their learned functions. However, standard gradient-based maps are frequently observed to be highly sensitive to the randomness of training data and the stochasticity in the training process. In this work, we study the role of Gaussian smoothing in the well-known Smooth-Grad algorithm in the stability of the gradient-based maps to the randomness of training samples. We extend the algorithmic stability framework to gradient-based interpretation maps and prove bounds on the stability error of standard Simple-Grad, Integrated-Gradients, and Smooth-Grad saliency maps. Our theoretical results suggest the role of Gaussian smoothing in boosting the stability of gradient-based maps to the randomness of training settings. On the other hand, we analyze the faithfulness of the Smooth-Grad maps to the original Simple-Grad and show the lower fidelity under a more intense Gaussian smoothing. We support our theoretical results by performing several numerical experiments on standard image datasets. Our empirical results confirm our hypothesis on the fidelity-stability trade-off in the application of Gaussian smoothing to gradient-based interpretation maps.</description>

      <title>MTA: Multimodal Task Alignment for BEV Perception and Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bird's eye view (BEV)-based 3D perception plays a crucial role in autonomous driving applications. The rise of large language models has spurred interest in BEV-based captioning to understand object behavior in the surrounding environment. However, existing approaches treat perception and captioning as separate tasks, focusing on the performance of only one task and overlooking the potential benefits of multimodal alignment. To bridge this gap between modalities, we introduce MTA, a novel multimodal task alignment framework that boosts both BEV perception and captioning. MTA consists of two key components: (1) BEV-Language Alignment (BLA), a contextual learning mechanism that aligns the BEV scene representations with ground-truth language representations, and (2) Detection-Captioning Alignment (DCA), a cross-modal prompting mechanism that aligns detection and captioning outputs. MTA seamlessly integrates into state-of-the-art baselines during training, adding no extra computational complexity at runtime. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and TOD3Cap datasets show that MTA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both tasks, achieving a 10.7% improvement in challenging rare perception scenarios and a 9.2% improvement in captioning. These results underscore the effectiveness of unified alignment in reconciling BEV-based perception and captioning.</description>

      <title>Going Beyond Conventional OOD Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical to ensure the safe deployment of deep learning models in critical applications. Deep learning models can often misidentify OOD samples as in-distribution (ID) samples. This vulnerability worsens in the presence of spurious correlation in the training set. Likewise, in fine-grained classification settings, detection of fine-grained OOD samples becomes inherently challenging due to their high similarity to ID samples. However, current research on OOD detection has largely ignored these challenging scenarios, focusing instead on relatively easier (conventional) cases. In this work, we present a unified Approach to Spurious, fine-grained, and Conventional OOD Detection (ASCOOD). First, we propose synthesizing virtual outliers from ID data by approximating the destruction of invariant features. To this end, we identify invariant features with the pixel attribution method using the model being learned. This approach eliminates the burden of curating external OOD datasets. Then, we simultaneously incentivize ID classification and predictive uncertainty towards virtual outliers leveraging standardized feature representation. Our approach effectively mitigates the impact of spurious correlations and encourages capturing fine-grained attributes. Extensive experiments across seven datasets demonstrate the merit of ASCOOD in spurious, fine-grained, and conventional settings.

      <title>Sensor-fusion based Prognostics Framework for Complex Engineering Systems Exhibiting Multiple Failure Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex engineering systems are often subject to multiple failure modes. Developing a remaining useful life (RUL) prediction model that does not consider the failure mode causing degradation is likely to result in inaccurate predictions. However, distinguishing between causes of failure without manually inspecting the system is nontrivial. This challenge is increased when the causes of historically observed failures are unknown. Sensors, which are useful for monitoring the state-of-health of systems, can also be used for distinguishing between multiple failure modes as the presence of multiple failure modes results in discriminatory behavior of the sensor signals. When systems are equipped with multiple sensors, some sensors may exhibit behavior correlated with degradation, while other sensors do not. Furthermore, which sensors exhibit this behavior may differ for each failure mode. In this paper, we present a simultaneous clustering and sensor selection approach for unlabeled training datasets of systems exhibiting multiple failure modes. The cluster assignments and the selected sensors are then utilized in real-time to first diagnose the active failure mode and then to predict the system RUL. We validate the methodology using a simulated dataset of systems exhibiting two failure modes and on NASA turbofan degradation dataset.</description>

      <title>OminiControl: Minimal and Universal Control for Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15098v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present OminiControl, a novel approach that rethinks how image conditions are integrated into Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures. Current image conditioning methods either introduce substantial parameter overhead or handle only specific control tasks effectively, limiting their practical versatility. OminiControl addresses these limitations through three key innovations: (1) a minimal architectural design that leverages the DiT's own VAE encoder and transformer blocks, requiring just 0.1% additional parameters; (2) a unified sequence processing strategy that combines condition tokens with image tokens for flexible token interactions; and (3) a dynamic position encoding mechanism that adapts to both spatially-aligned and non-aligned control tasks. Our extensive experiments show that this streamlined approach not only matches but surpasses the performance of specialized methods across multiple conditioning tasks. To overcome data limitations in subject-driven generation, we also introduce Subjects200K, a large-scale dataset of identity-consistent image pairs synthesized using DiT models themselves. This work demonstrates that effective image control can be achieved without architectural complexity, opening new possibilities for efficient and versatile image generation systems.</description>

      <title>MambaIRv2: Attentive State Space Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mamba-based image restoration backbones have recently demonstrated significant potential in balancing global reception and computational efficiency. However, the inherent causal modeling limitation of Mamba, where each token depends solely on its predecessors in the scanned sequence, restricts the full utilization of pixels across the image and thus presents new challenges in image restoration. In this work, we propose MambaIRv2, which equips Mamba with the non-causal modeling ability similar to ViTs to reach the attentive state space restoration model. Specifically, the proposed attentive state-space equation allows to attend beyond the scanned sequence and facilitate image unfolding with just one single scan. Moreover, we further introduce a semantic-guided neighboring mechanism to encourage interaction between distant but similar pixels. Extensive experiments show our MambaIRv2 outperforms SRFormer by even 0.35dB PSNR for lightweight SR even with 9.3\% less parameters and suppresses HAT on classic SR by up to 0.29dB.

      <title>ROSE: Revolutionizing Open-Set Dense Segmentation with Patch-Wise Perceptual Large Multimodal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have enabled open-vocabulary and free-text segmentation, yet existing models still require predefined category prompts, limiting free-form category self-generation. Most segmentation LMMs also remain confined to sparse predictions, restricting their applicability in open-set environments. In contrast, we propose ROSE, a Revolutionary Open-set dense SEgmentation LMM, which enables dense mask prediction and open-category generation through patch-wise perception. Our method treats each image patch as an independent region of interest candidate, enabling the model to predict both dense and sparse masks simultaneously. Additionally, a newly designed instruction-response paradigm takes full advantage of the generation and generalization capabilities of LMMs, achieving category prediction independent of closed-set constraints or predefined categories. To further enhance mask detail and category precision, we introduce a conversation-based refinement paradigm, integrating the prediction result from previous step with textual prompt for revision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ROSE achieves competitive performance across various segmentation tasks in a unified framework. Code will be released.</description>

      <title>Integrating Semantic Communication and Human Decision-Making into an End-to-End Sensing-Decision Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As early as 1949, Weaver defined communication in a very broad sense to include all procedures by which one mind or technical system can influence another, thus establishing the idea of semantic communication. With the recent success of machine learning in expert assistance systems where sensed information is wirelessly provided to a human to assist task execution, the need to design effective and efficient communications has become increasingly apparent. In particular, semantic communication aims to convey the meaning behind the sensed information relevant for Human Decision-Making (HDM). Regarding the interplay between semantic communication and HDM, many questions remain, such as how to model the entire end-to-end sensing-decision-making process, how to design semantic communication for the HDM and which information should be provided to the HDM. To address these questions, we propose to integrate semantic communication and HDM into one probabilistic end-to-end sensing-decision framework that bridges communications and psychology. In our interdisciplinary framework, we model the human through a HDM process, allowing us to explore how feature extraction from semantic communication can best support HDM both in theory and in simulations. In this sense, our study reveals the fundamental design trade-off between maximizing the relevant semantic information and matching the cognitive capabilities of the HDM model. Our initial analysis shows how semantic communication can balance the level of detail with human cognitive capabilities while demanding less bandwidth, power, and latency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07205v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a sustainable and essential approach for infrastructure maintenance, enabling the early detection of structural defects. Leveraging computer vision (CV) methods for automated infrastructure monitoring can significantly enhance monitoring efficiency and precision. However, these methods often face challenges in efficiency and accuracy, particularly in complex environments. Recent CNN-based and SAM-based approaches have demonstrated excellent performance in crack segmentation, but their high computational demands limit their applicability on edge devices. This paper introduces CrackESS, a novel system for detecting and segmenting concrete cracks. The approach first utilizes a YOLOv8 model for self-prompting and a LoRA-based fine-tuned SAM model for crack segmentation, followed by refining the segmentation masks through the proposed Crack Mask Refinement Module (CMRM). We conduct experiments on three datasets(Khanhha's dataset, Crack500, CrackCR) and validate CrackESS on a climbing robot system to demonstrate the advantage and effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying the training data samples that most influence a generated image is a critical task in understanding diffusion models (DMs), yet existing influence estimation methods are constrained to small-scale or LoRA-tuned models due to computational limitations. To address this challenge, we propose DMin (Diffusion Model influence), a scalable framework for estimating the influence of each training data sample on a given generated image. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first method capable of influence estimation for DMs with billions of parameters. Leveraging efficient gradient compression, DMin reduces storage requirements from hundreds of TBs to mere MBs or even KBs, and retrieves the top-k most influential training samples in under 1 second, all while maintaining performance. Our empirical results demonstrate DMin is both effective in identifying influential training samples and efficient in terms of computational and storage requirements.</description>

      <title>SCBench: A KV Cache-Centric Analysis of Long-Context Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-context LLMs have enabled numerous downstream applications but also introduced significant challenges related to computational and memory efficiency. To address these challenges, optimizations for long-context inference have been developed, centered around the KV cache. However, existing benchmarks often evaluate in single-request, neglecting the full lifecycle of the KV cache in real-world use. This oversight is particularly critical, as KV cache reuse has become widely adopted in LLMs inference frameworks, such as vLLM and SGLang, as well as by LLM providers, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Anthropic. To address this gap, we introduce SCBench(SharedContextBench), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating long-context methods from a KV cachecentric perspective: 1) KV cache generation, 2) KV cache compression, 3) KV cache retrieval, 4) KV cache loading. Specifically, SCBench uses test examples with shared context, ranging 12 tasks with two shared context modes, covering four categories of long-context capabilities: string retrieval, semantic retrieval, global information, and multi-task. With it, we provide an extensive KV cache-centric analysis of eight categories long-context solutions, including Gated Linear RNNs, Mamba-Attention hybrids, and efficient methods such as sparse attention, KV cache dropping, quantization, retrieval, loading, and prompt compression. The evaluation is conducted on 8 long-context LLMs. Our findings show that sub-O(n) memory methods suffer in multi-turn scenarios, while sparse encoding with O(n) memory and sub-O(n^2) pre-filling computation perform robustly. Dynamic sparsity yields more expressive KV caches than static patterns, and layer-level sparsity in hybrid architectures reduces memory usage with strong performance. Additionally, we identify attention distribution shift issues in long-generation scenarios. https://aka.ms/SCBench.</description>

      <title>Bilevel Learning with Inexact Stochastic Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bilevel learning has gained prominence in machine learning, inverse problems, and imaging applications, including hyperparameter optimization, learning data-adaptive regularizers, and optimizing forward operators. The large-scale nature of these problems has led to the development of inexact and computationally efficient methods. Existing adaptive methods predominantly rely on deterministic formulations, while stochastic approaches often adopt a doubly-stochastic framework with impractical variance assumptions, enforces a fixed number of lower-level iterations, and requires extensive tuning. In this work, we focus on bilevel learning with strongly convex lower-level problems and a nonconvex sum-of-functions in the upper-level. Stochasticity arises from data sampling in the upper-level which leads to inexact stochastic hypergradients. We establish their connection to state-of-the-art stochastic optimization theory for nonconvex objectives. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of inexact stochastic bilevel optimization under mild assumptions. Our empirical results highlight significant speed-ups and improved generalization in imaging tasks such as image denoising and deblurring in comparison with adaptive deterministic bilevel methods.</description>

      <title>AV-Link: Temporally-Aligned Diffusion Features for Cross-Modal Audio-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose AV-Link, a unified framework for Video-to-Audio (A2V) and Audio-to-Video (A2V) generation that leverages the activations of frozen video and audio diffusion models for temporally-aligned cross-modal conditioning. The key to our framework is a Fusion Block that facilitates bidirectional information exchange between video and audio diffusion models through temporally-aligned self attention operations. Unlike prior work that uses dedicated models for A2V and V2A tasks and relies on pretrained feature extractors, AV-Link achieves both tasks in a single self-contained framework, directly leveraging features obtained by the complementary modality (i.e. video features to generate audio, or audio features to generate video). Extensive automatic and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves a substantial improvement in audio-video synchronization, outperforming more expensive baselines such as the MovieGen video-to-audio model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While generative models such as text-to-image, large language models and text-to-video have seen significant progress, the extension to text-to-virtual-reality remains largely unexplored, due to a deficit in training data and the complexity of achieving realistic depth and motion in virtual environments. This paper proposes an approach to coalesce existing generative systems to form a stereoscopic virtual reality video from text.
  Carried out in three main stages, we start with a base text-to-image model that captures context from an input text. We then employ Stable Diffusion on the rudimentary image produced, to generate frames with enhanced realism and overall quality. These frames are processed with depth estimation algorithms to create left-eye and right-eye views, which are stitched side-by-side to create an immersive viewing experience. Such systems would be highly beneficial in virtual reality production, since filming and scene building often require extensive hours of work and post-production effort.
  We utilize image evaluation techniques, specifically Fr\'echet Inception Distance and CLIP Score, to assess the visual quality of frames produced for the video. These quantitative measures establish the proficiency of the proposed method.
  Our work highlights the exciting possibilities of using natural language-driven graphics in fields like virtual reality simulations.</description>

      <title>Amortized Bayesian Mixture Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite mixtures are a broad class of models useful in scenarios where observed data is generated by multiple distinct processes but without explicit information about the responsible process for each data point. Estimating Bayesian mixture models is computationally challenging due to issues such as high-dimensional posterior inference and label switching. Furthermore, traditional methods such as MCMC are applicable only if the likelihoods for each mixture component are analytically tractable.
  Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) is a simulation-based framework for estimating Bayesian models using generative neural networks. This allows the fitting of models without explicit likelihoods, and provides fast inference. ABI is therefore an attractive framework for estimating mixture models. This paper introduces a novel extension of ABI tailored to mixture models. We factorize the posterior into a distribution of the parameters and a distribution of (categorical) mixture indicators, which allows us to use a combination of generative neural networks for parameter inference, and classification networks for mixture membership identification. The proposed framework accommodates both independent and dependent mixture models, enabling filtering and smoothing. We validate and demonstrate our approach through synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Automating High Quality RT Planning at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiotherapy (RT) planning is complex, subjective, and time-intensive. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) promise to improve its precision, efficiency, and consistency, but progress is often limited by the scarcity of large, standardized datasets. To address this, we introduce the Automated Iterative RT Planning (AIRTP) system, a scalable solution for generating high-quality treatment plans. This scalable solution is designed to generate substantial volumes of consistently high-quality treatment plans, overcoming a key obstacle in the advancement of AI-driven RT planning. Our AIRTP pipeline adheres to clinical guidelines and automates essential steps, including organ-at-risk (OAR) contouring, helper structure creation, beam setup, optimization, and plan quality improvement, using AI integrated with RT planning software like Eclipse of Varian. Furthermore, a novel approach for determining optimization parameters to reproduce 3D dose distributions, i.e. a method to convert dose predictions to deliverable treatment plans constrained by machine limitations. A comparative analysis of plan quality reveals that our automated pipeline produces treatment plans of quality comparable to those generated manually, which traditionally require several hours of labor per plan. Committed to public research, the first data release of our AIRTP pipeline includes nine cohorts covering head-and-neck and lung cancer sites to support an AAPM 2025 challenge. This data set features more than 10 times the number of plans compared to the largest existing well-curated public data set to our best knowledge.

      <title>SIC: Similarity-Based Interpretable Image Classification with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of deep learning models in critical domains necessitates a balance between high accuracy and interpretability. We introduce SIC, an inherently interpretable neural network that provides local and global explanations of its decision-making process. Leveraging the concept of case-based reasoning, SIC extracts class-representative support vectors from training images, ensuring they capture relevant features while suppressing irrelevant ones. Classification decisions are made by calculating and aggregating similarity scores between these support vectors and the input's latent feature vector. We employ B-Cos transformations, which align model weights with inputs, to yield coherent pixel-level explanations in addition to global explanations of case-based reasoning. We evaluate SIC on three tasks: fine-grained classification on Stanford Dogs and FunnyBirds, multi-label classification on Pascal VOC, and pathology detection on the RSNA dataset. Results indicate that SIC not only achieves competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art black-box and inherently interpretable models but also offers insightful explanations verified through practical evaluation on the FunnyBirds benchmark. Our theoretical analysis proves that these explanations fulfill established axioms for explanations. Our findings underscore SIC's potential for applications where understanding model decisions is as critical as the decisions themselves.</description>

      <title>Reflection-Window Decoding: Text Generation with Selective Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The autoregressive decoding for text generation in large language models (LLMs), while widely used, is inherently suboptimal due to the lack of a built-in mechanism to perform refinement and/or correction of the generated content. In this paper, we consider optimality in terms of the joint probability over the generated response, when jointly considering all tokens at the same time. We theoretically characterize the potential deviation of the autoregressively generated response from its globally optimal counterpart that is of the same length. Our analysis suggests that we need to be cautious when noticeable uncertainty arises during text generation, which may signal the sub-optimality of the generation history. To address the pitfall of autoregressive decoding for text generation, we propose an approach that incorporates a sliding reflection window and a pausing criterion, such that refinement and generation can be carried out interchangeably as the decoding proceeds. Our selective refinement framework strikes a balance between efficiency and optimality, and our extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Spectral-factorized Positive-definite Curvature Learning for NN Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many training methods, such as Adam(W) and Shampoo, learn a positive-definite curvature matrix and apply an inverse root before preconditioning. Recently, non-diagonal training methods, such as Shampoo, have gained significant attention; however, they remain computationally inefficient and are limited to specific types of curvature information due to the costly matrix root computation via matrix decomposition. To address this, we propose a Riemannian optimization approach that dynamically adapts spectral-factorized positive-definite curvature estimates, enabling the efficient application of arbitrary matrix roots and generic curvature learning. We demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of our approach in positive-definite matrix optimization and covariance adaptation for gradient-free optimization, as well as its efficiency in curvature learning for neural net training.</description>

      <title>ReasonFlux: Hierarchical LLM Reasoning via Scaling Thought Templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present that hierarchical LLM reasoning via scaling thought templates can effectively optimize the reasoning search space and outperform the mathematical reasoning capabilities of powerful LLMs like OpenAI o1-preview and DeepSeek V3. We train our ReasonFlux-32B model with only 8 GPUs and introduces three innovations: (i) a structured and generic thought template library, containing around 500 high-level thought templates capable of generalizing to similar or relevant reasoning problems; (ii) performing hierarchical reinforcement learning on a sequence of thought templates instead of long CoTs, optimizing a base LLM to plan out an optimal template trajectory for gradually handling complex problems; (iii) a brand new inference scaling system that enables hierarchical LLM reasoning by adaptively scaling thought templates at inference time. With a template trajectory containing more explainable reasoning structures than DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini, our ReasonFlux-32B significantly advances math reasoning capabilities to state-of-the-art levels. Notably, on the MATH benchmark, it achieves an accuracy of 91.2% and surpasses o1-preview by 6.7%. On the USA Math Olympiad (AIME) benchmark, ReasonFlux-32B solves an average of 56.7% of problems, surpassing o1-preview and DeepSeek-V3 by 27% and 45%, respectively.

      <description>arXiv:2502.07036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (Gen AI) with large language models (LLMs) are being widely adopted across the industry, academia and government. Cybersecurity is one of the key sectors where LLMs can be and/or are already being used. There are a number of problems that inhibit the adoption of trustworthy Gen AI and LLMs in cybersecurity and such other critical areas. One of the key challenge to the trustworthiness and reliability of LLMs is: how consistent an LLM is in its responses? In this paper, we have analyzed and developed a formal definition of consistency of responses of LLMs. We have formally defined what is consistency of responses and then develop a framework for consistency evaluation. The paper proposes two approaches to validate consistency: self-validation, and validation across multiple LLMs. We have carried out extensive experiments for several LLMs such as GPT4oMini, GPT3.5, Gemini, Cohere, and Llama3, on a security benchmark consisting of several cybersecurity questions: informational and situational. Our experiments corroborate the fact that even though these LLMs are being considered and/or already being used for several cybersecurity tasks today, they are often inconsistent in their responses, and thus are untrustworthy and unreliable for cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>TSP3D: Text-guided Sparse Voxel Pruning for Efficient 3D Visual Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-level convolution architecture for 3D visual grounding. Conventional methods are difficult to meet the requirements of real-time inference due to the two-stage or point-based architecture. Inspired by the success of multi-level fully sparse convolutional architecture in 3D object detection, we aim to build a new 3D visual grounding framework following this technical route. However, as in 3D visual grounding task the 3D scene representation should be deeply interacted with text features, sparse convolution-based architecture is inefficient for this interaction due to the large amount of voxel features. To this end, we propose text-guided pruning (TGP) and completion-based addition (CBA) to deeply fuse 3D scene representation and text features in an efficient way by gradual region pruning and target completion. Specifically, TGP iteratively sparsifies the 3D scene representation and thus efficiently interacts the voxel features with text features by cross-attention. To mitigate the affect of pruning on delicate geometric information, CBA adaptively fixes the over-pruned region by voxel completion with negligible computational overhead. Compared with previous single-stage methods, our method achieves top inference speed and surpasses previous fastest method by 100\% FPS. Our method also achieves state-of-the-art accuracy even compared with two-stage methods, with $+1.13$ lead of Acc@0.5 on ScanRefer, and $+2.6$ and $+3.2$ leads on NR3D and SR3D respectively.

      <title>IMLE Policy: Fast and Sample Efficient Visuomotor Policy Learning via Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in imitation learning, particularly using generative modelling techniques like diffusion, have enabled policies to capture complex multi-modal action distributions. However, these methods often require large datasets and multiple inference steps for action generation, posing challenges in robotics where the cost for data collection is high and computation resources are limited. To address this, we introduce IMLE Policy, a novel behaviour cloning approach based on Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE). IMLE Policy excels in low-data regimes, effectively learning from minimal demonstrations and requiring 38\% less data on average to match the performance of baseline methods in learning complex multi-modal behaviours. Its simple generator-based architecture enables single-step action generation, improving inference speed by 97.3\% compared to Diffusion Policy, while outperforming single-step Flow Matching. We validate our approach across diverse manipulation tasks in simulated and real-world environments, showcasing its ability to capture complex behaviours under data constraints.

      <title>Benchmarking Self-Supervised Methods for Accelerated MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14009v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing MRI from highly undersampled measurements is crucial for accelerating medical imaging, but is challenging due to the ill-posedness of the inverse problem. While supervised deep learning approaches have shown remarkable success, they rely on fully-sampled ground truth data, which is often impractical or impossible to obtain. Recently, numerous self-supervised methods have emerged that do not require ground truth, however, the lack of systematic comparison and standard experimental setups have hindered research. We present the first comprehensive review of loss functions from all feedforward self-supervised methods and the first benchmark on accelerated MRI reconstruction without ground truth, showing that there is a wide range in performance across methods. In addition, we propose Multi-Operator Equivariant Imaging (MO-EI), a novel framework that builds on the imaging model considered in existing methods to outperform all state-of-the-art and approaches supervised performance. Finally, to facilitate reproducible benchmarking, we provide implementations of all methods in the DeepInverse library (https://deepinv.github.io) and easy-to-use demo code at https://andrewwango.github.io/deepinv-selfsup-fastmri.</description>

      <title>FR-Spec: Accelerating Large-Vocabulary Language Models via Frequency-Ranked Speculative Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative sampling has emerged as an important technique for accelerating the auto-regressive generation process of large language models (LLMs) by utilizing a draft-then-verify mechanism to produce multiple tokens per forward pass. While state-of-the-art speculative sampling methods use only a single layer and a language modeling (LM) head as the draft model to achieve impressive layer compression, their efficiency gains are substantially reduced for large-vocabulary LLMs, such as Llama-3-8B with a vocabulary of 128k tokens. To address this, we present FR-Spec, a frequency-ranked speculative sampling framework that optimizes draft candidate selection through vocabulary space compression. By constraining the draft search to a frequency-prioritized token subset, our method reduces LM Head computation overhead by 75% while ensuring the equivalence of the final output distribution. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate an average of 1.12$\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art speculative sampling method EAGLE-2.

      <title>Quantifying Overfitting along the Regularization Path for Two-Part-Code MDL in Supervised Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete characterization of the entire regularization curve of a modified two-part-code Minimum Description Length (MDL) learning rule for binary classification, based on an arbitrary prior or description language. Grunwald and Langford [2004] previously established the lack of asymptotic consistency, from an agnostic PAC (frequentist worst case) perspective, of the MDL rule with a penalty parameter of $\lambda=1$, suggesting that it underegularizes. Driven by interest in understanding how benign or catastrophic under-regularization and overfitting might be, we obtain a precise quantitative description of the worst case limiting error as a function of the regularization parameter $\lambda$ and noise level (or approximation error), significantly tightening the analysis of Grunwald and Langford for $\lambda=1$ and extending it to all other choices of $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>X2CT-CLIP: Enable Multi-Abnormality Detection in Computed Tomography from Chest Radiography via Tri-Modal Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is a key imaging modality for diagnosis, yet its clinical utility is marred by high radiation exposure and long turnaround times, restricting its use for larger-scale screening. Although chest radiography (CXR) is more accessible and safer, existing CXR foundation models focus primarily on detecting diseases that are readily visible on the CXR. Recently, works have explored training disease classification models on simulated CXRs, but they remain limited to recognizing a single disease type from CT. CT foundation models have also emerged with significantly improved detection of pathologies in CT. However, the generalized application of CT-derived labels on CXR has remained illusive. In this study, we propose X2CT-CLIP, a tri-modal knowledge transfer learning framework that bridges the modality gap between CT and CXR while reducing the computational burden of model training. Our approach is the first work to enable multi-abnormality classification in CT, using CXR, by transferring knowledge from 3D CT volumes and associated radiology reports to a CXR encoder via a carefully designed tri-modal alignment mechanism in latent space. Extensive evaluations on three multi-label CT datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cross-modal retrieval, few-shot adaptation, and external validation. These results highlight the potential of CXR, enriched with knowledge derived from CT, as a viable efficient alternative for disease detection in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>IterPref: Focal Preference Learning for Code Generation via Iterative Debugging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preference learning enhances Code LLMs beyond supervised fine-tuning by leveraging relative quality comparisons. Existing methods construct preference pairs from
  candidates based on test case success, treating the higher pass rate sample as positive and the lower as negative. However, this approach does not pinpoint specific errors in the code, which prevents the model from learning more informative error correction patterns, as aligning failing code as a whole lacks the granularity needed to capture meaningful error-resolution relationships. To address these issues, we propose IterPref, a new preference alignment framework that mimics human iterative debugging to refine Code LLMs. IterPref explicitly locates error regions and aligns the corresponding tokens via a tailored DPO algorithm. To generate informative pairs, we introduce the CodeFlow dataset, where samples are iteratively refined until passing tests, with modifications capturing error corrections. Extensive experiments show that a diverse suite of Code LLMs equipped with IterPref achieves significant performance gains in code generation and improves on challenging tasks like BigCodeBench. In-depth analysis reveals that IterPref yields fewer errors. Our code and data will be made publicaly available.</description>

      <title>(How) Do Language Models Track State?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer language models (LMs) exhibit behaviors -- from storytelling to code generation -- that appear to require tracking the unobserved state of an evolving world. How do they do so? We study state tracking in LMs trained or fine-tuned to compose permutations (i.e., to compute the order of a set of objects after a sequence of swaps). Despite the simple algebraic structure of this problem, many other tasks (e.g., simulation of finite automata and evaluation of boolean expressions) can be reduced to permutation composition, making it a natural model for state tracking in general. We show that LMs consistently learn one of two state tracking mechanisms for this task. The first closely resembles the "associative scan" construction used in recent theoretical work by Liu et al. (2023) and Merrill et al. (2024). The second uses an easy-to-compute feature (permutation parity) to partially prune the space of outputs, then refines this with an associative scan. The two mechanisms exhibit markedly different robustness properties, and we show how to steer LMs toward one or the other with intermediate training tasks that encourage or suppress the heuristics. Our results demonstrate that transformer LMs, whether pretrained or fine-tuned, can learn to implement efficient and interpretable state tracking mechanisms, and the emergence of these mechanisms can be predicted and controlled.</description>

      <title>Robust Data Watermarking in Language Models by Injecting Fictitious Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data watermarking in language models injects traceable signals, such as specific token sequences or stylistic patterns, into copyrighted text, allowing copyright holders to track and verify training data ownership. Previous data watermarking techniques primarily focus on effective memorization after pretraining, while overlooking challenges that arise in other stages of the LLM pipeline, such as the risk of watermark filtering during data preprocessing, or potential forgetting through post-training, or verification difficulties due to API-only access. We propose a novel data watermarking approach that injects coherent and plausible yet fictitious knowledge into training data using generated passages describing a fictitious entity and its associated attributes. Our watermarks are designed to be memorized by the LLM through seamlessly integrating in its training data, making them harder to detect lexically during preprocessing. We demonstrate that our watermarks can be effectively memorized by LLMs, and that increasing our watermarks' density, length, and diversity of attributes strengthens their memorization. We further show that our watermarks remain robust throughout LLM development, maintaining their effectiveness after continual pretraining and supervised finetuning. Finally, we show that our data watermarks can be evaluated even under API-only access via question answering.</description>

      <title>Balcony: A Lightweight Approach to Dynamic Inference of Generative Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications is often hindered by strict computational and latency constraints. While dynamic inference offers the flexibility to adjust model behavior based on varying resource budgets, existing methods are frequently limited by hardware inefficiencies or performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce Balcony, a simple yet highly effective framework for depth-based dynamic inference. By freezing the pretrained LLM and inserting additional transformer layers at selected exit points, Balcony maintains the full model's performance while enabling real-time adaptation to different computational budgets. These additional layers are trained using a straightforward self-distillation loss, aligning the sub-model outputs with those of the full model. This approach requires significantly fewer training tokens and tunable parameters, drastically reducing computational costs compared to prior methods. When applied to the LLaMA3-8B model, using only 0.2% of the original pretraining data, Balcony achieves minimal performance degradation while enabling significant speedups. Remarkably, we show that Balcony outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as Flextron and Layerskip as well as other leading compression techniques on multiple models and at various scales, across a variety of benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Toward an Evaluation Science for Generative AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is an increasing imperative to anticipate and understand the performance and safety of generative AI systems in real-world deployment contexts. However, the current evaluation ecosystem is insufficient: Commonly used static benchmarks face validity challenges, and ad hoc case-by-case audits rarely scale. In this piece, we advocate for maturing an evaluation science for generative AI systems. While generative AI creates unique challenges for system safety engineering and measurement science, the field can draw valuable insights from the development of safety evaluation practices in other fields, including transportation, aerospace, and pharmaceutical engineering. In particular, we present three key lessons: Evaluation metrics must be applicable to real-world performance, metrics must be iteratively refined, and evaluation institutions and norms must be established. Applying these insights, we outline a concrete path toward a more rigorous approach for evaluating generative AI systems.</description>

      <title>CBW: Towards Dataset Ownership Verification for Speaker Verification via Clustering-based Backdoor Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing adoption of deep learning in speaker verification, large-scale speech datasets have become valuable intellectual property. To audit and prevent the unauthorized usage of these valuable released datasets, especially in commercial or open-source scenarios, we propose a novel dataset ownership verification method. Our approach introduces a clustering-based backdoor watermark (CBW), enabling dataset owners to determine whether a suspicious third-party model has been trained on a protected dataset under a black-box setting. The CBW method consists of two key stages: dataset watermarking and ownership verification. During watermarking, we implant multiple trigger patterns in the dataset to make similar samples (measured by their feature similarities) close to the same trigger while dissimilar samples are near different triggers. This ensures that any model trained on the watermarked dataset exhibits specific misclassification behaviors when exposed to trigger-embedded inputs. To verify dataset ownership, we design a hypothesis-test-based framework that statistically evaluates whether a suspicious model exhibits the expected backdoor behavior. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, verifying the effectiveness and robustness of our method against potential adaptive attacks. The code for reproducing main experiments is available at https://github.com/Radiant0726/CBW</description>

      <title>GraphGarment: Learning Garment Dynamics for Bimanual Cloth Manipulation Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical manipulation of garments is often crucial when performing fabric-related tasks, such as hanging garments. However, due to the deformable nature of fabrics, these operations remain a significant challenge for robots in household, healthcare, and industrial environments. In this paper, we propose GraphGarment, a novel approach that models garment dynamics based on robot control inputs and applies the learned dynamics model to facilitate garment manipulation tasks such as hanging. Specifically, we use graphs to represent the interactions between the robot end-effector and the garment. GraphGarment uses a graph neural network (GNN) to learn a dynamics model that can predict the next garment state given the current state and input action in simulation. To address the substantial sim-to-real gap, we propose a residual model that compensates for garment state prediction errors, thereby improving real-world performance. The garment dynamics model is then applied to a model-based action sampling strategy, where it is utilized to manipulate the garment to a reference pre-hanging configuration for garment-hanging tasks. We conducted four experiments using six types of garments to validate our approach in both simulation and real-world settings. In simulation experiments, GraphGarment achieves better garment state prediction performance, with a prediction error 0.46 cm lower than the best baseline. Our approach also demonstrates improved performance in the garment-hanging simulation experiment with enhancements of 12%, 24%, and 10%, respectively. Moreover, real-world robot experiments confirm the robustness of sim-to-real transfer, with an error increase of 0.17 cm compared to simulation results.

      <title>Vision-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DeepSeek-R1-Zero has successfully demonstrated the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs purely through Reinforcement Learning (RL). Inspired by this breakthrough, we explore how RL can be utilized to enhance the reasoning capability of MLLMs. However, direct training with RL struggles to activate complex reasoning capabilities such as questioning and reflection in MLLMs, due to the absence of substantial high-quality multimodal reasoning data. To address this issue, we propose the reasoning MLLM, Vision-R1, to improve multimodal reasoning capability. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality multimodal CoT dataset without human annotations by leveraging an existing MLLM and DeepSeek-R1 through modality bridging and data filtering to obtain a 200K multimodal CoT dataset, Vision-R1-cold dataset. It serves as cold-start initialization data for Vision-R1. To mitigate the optimization challenges caused by overthinking after cold start, we propose Progressive Thinking Suppression Training (PTST) strategy and employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with the hard formatting result reward function to gradually refine the model's ability to learn correct and complex reasoning processes on a 10K multimodal math dataset. Comprehensive experiments show our model achieves an average improvement of $\sim$6% across various multimodal math reasoning benchmarks. Vision-R1-7B achieves a 73.5% accuracy on the widely used MathVista benchmark, which is only 0.4% lower than the leading reasoning model, OpenAI O1. The datasets and code will be released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Vision-R1 .</description>

      <title>Interactive Medical Image Analysis with Concept-based Similarity Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to interpret and intervene model decisions is important for the adoption of computer-aided diagnosis methods in clinical workflows. Recent concept-based methods link the model predictions with interpretable concepts and modify their activation scores to interact with the model. However, these concepts are at the image level, which hinders the model from pinpointing the exact patches the concepts are activated. Alternatively, prototype-based methods learn representations from training image patches and compare these with test image patches, using the similarity scores for final class prediction. However, interpreting the underlying concepts of these patches can be challenging and often necessitates post-hoc guesswork. To address this issue, this paper introduces the novel Concept-based Similarity Reasoning network (CSR), which offers (i) patch-level prototype with intrinsic concept interpretation, and (ii) spatial interactivity. First, the proposed CSR provides localized explanation by grounding prototypes of each concept on image regions. Second, our model introduces novel spatial-level interaction, allowing doctors to engage directly with specific image areas, making it an intuitive and transparent tool for medical imaging. CSR improves upon prior state-of-the-art interpretable methods by up to 4.5\% across three biomedical datasets. Our code is released at https://github.com/tadeephuy/InteractCSR.</description>

      <title>Materials Map Integrating Experimental and Computational Data through Graph-Based Machine Learning for Enhanced Materials Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Materials informatics (MI), which emerges from the integration of materials science and data science, is expected to greatly streamline the material discovery and development. The data used for MI are obtained from both computational and experimental studies, while their integration remains challenging. In our previous study, we reported the integration of these datasets by applying a machine learning model that captures trends hidden in the experimental datasets to compositional data stored in the computational database. In this study, we use the obtained data to construct materials maps, which visualize the relation in the structural features of materials, aiming to support study by the experimental researchers. The map is constructed using the MatDeepLearn (MDL) framework, which implements the graph-based representation of material structures, deep learning, and dimensional reduction for the map construction. We evaluate the obtained materials maps through statistical analysis and found that the MDL using message passing neural network (MPNN) enables efficient extraction of features that reflect the structural complexity of materials. Moreover, we found that this advantage does not necessarily translate into improved accuracy in predicting material properties. We attribute this unexpected outcome to the high learning performance inherent in MPNN, which can contribute to the structuring of data points within the materials map.</description>
