      <title>Natural Language Processing for the Legal Domain: A Survey of Tasks, Datasets, Models, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural Language Processing is revolutionizing the way legal professionals and laypersons operate in the legal field. The considerable potential for Natural Language Processing in the legal sector, especially in developing computational tools for various legal processes, has captured the interest of researchers for years. This survey follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses framework, reviewing 148 studies, with a final selection of 127 after manual filtering. It explores foundational concepts related to Natural Language Processing in the legal domain, illustrating the unique aspects and challenges of processing legal texts, such as extensive document length, complex language, and limited open legal datasets. We provide an overview of Natural Language Processing tasks specific to legal text, such as Legal Document Summarization, legal Named Entity Recognition, Legal Question Answering, Legal Text Classification, and Legal Judgment Prediction. In the section on legal Language Models, we analyze both developed Language Models and approaches for adapting general Language Models to the legal domain. Additionally, we identify 15 Open Research Challenges, including bias in Artificial Intelligence applications, the need for more robust and interpretable models, and improving explainability to handle the complexities of legal language and reasoning.</description>

      <title>Decoding Diffusion: A Scalable Framework for Unsupervised Analysis of Latent Space Biases and Representations Using Natural Language Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have made diffusion models powerful tools for creating high-quality images. However, their iterative denoising process makes understanding and interpreting their semantic latent spaces more challenging than other generative models, such as GANs. Recent methods have attempted to address this issue by identifying semantically meaningful directions within the latent space. However, they often need manual interpretation or are limited in the number of vectors that can be trained, restricting their scope and utility. This paper proposes a novel framework for unsupervised exploration of diffusion latent spaces. We directly leverage natural language prompts and image captions to map latent directions. This method allows for the automatic understanding of hidden features and supports a broader range of analysis without the need to train specific vectors. Our method provides a more scalable and interpretable understanding of the semantic knowledge encoded within diffusion models, facilitating comprehensive analysis of latent biases and the nuanced representations these models learn. Experimental results show that our framework can uncover hidden patterns and associations in various domains, offering new insights into the interpretability of diffusion model latent spaces.</description>

      <title>GraphLSS: Integrating Lexical, Structural, and Semantic Features for Long Document Extractive Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks have recently gained attention for long document summarization, modeling the extraction as a node classification task. Although effective, these models often require external tools or additional machine learning models to define graph components, producing highly complex and less intuitive structures. We present GraphLSS, a heterogeneous graph construction for long document extractive summarization, incorporating Lexical, Structural, and Semantic features. It defines two levels of information (words and sentences) and four types of edges (sentence semantic similarity, sentence occurrence order, word in sentence, and word semantic similarity) without any need for auxiliary learning models. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that GraphLSS is competitive with top-performing graph-based methods, outperforming recent non-graph models. We release our code on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Derivation Graphs: A Task for Summarizing Equation Dependencies in STEM Manuscripts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), particularly with the emergence of large language models (LLMs), have significantly enhanced the field of textual analysis. However, while these developments have yielded substantial progress in analyzing textual data, applying analysis to mathematical equations and their relationships within texts has produced mixed results. In this paper, we take the initial steps toward understanding the dependency relationships between mathematical expressions in STEM articles. Our dataset, sourced from a random sampling of the arXiv corpus, contains an analysis of 107 published STEM manuscripts whose inter-equation dependency relationships have been hand-labeled, resulting in a new object we refer to as a derivation graph that summarizes the mathematical content of the manuscript. We exhaustively evaluate analytical and NLP-based models to assess their capability to identify and extract the derivation relationships for each article and compare the results with the ground truth. Our comprehensive testing finds that both analytical and NLP models (including LLMs) achieve $\sim$40-50% F1 scores for extracting derivation graphs from articles, revealing that the recent advances in NLP have not made significant inroads in comprehending mathematical texts compared to simpler analytic models. While current approaches offer a solid foundation for extracting mathematical information, further research is necessary to improve accuracy and depth in this area.</description>

      <title>LLM Robustness Against Misinformation in Biomedical Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach is used to reduce the confabulation of large language models (LLMs) for question answering by retrieving and providing additional context coming from external knowledge sources (e.g., by adding the context to the prompt). However, injecting incorrect information can mislead the LLM to generate an incorrect answer.
  In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of four LLMs against misinformation - Gemma 2, GPT-4o-mini, Llama~3.1, and Mixtral - in answering biomedical questions. We assess the answer accuracy on yes-no and free-form questions in three scenarios: vanilla LLM answers (no context is provided), "perfect" augmented generation (correct context is provided), and prompt-injection attacks (incorrect context is provided). Our results show that Llama 3.1 (70B parameters) achieves the highest accuracy in both vanilla (0.651) and "perfect" RAG (0.802) scenarios. However, the accuracy gap between the models almost disappears with "perfect" RAG, suggesting its potential to mitigate the LLM's size-related effectiveness differences.
  We further evaluate the ability of the LLMs to generate malicious context on one hand and the LLM's robustness against prompt-injection attacks on the other hand, using metrics such as attack success rate (ASR), accuracy under attack, and accuracy drop. As adversaries, we use the same four LLMs (Gemma 2, GPT-4o-mini, Llama 3.1, and Mixtral) to generate incorrect context that is injected in the target model's prompt. Interestingly, Llama is shown to be the most effective adversary, causing accuracy drops of up to 0.48 for vanilla answers and 0.63 for "perfect" RAG across target models. Our analysis reveals that robustness rankings vary depending on the evaluation measure, highlighting the complexity of assessing LLM resilience to adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs): Improved Prompt Injection Attacks Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming a popular tool as they have significantly advanced in their capability to tackle a wide range of language-based tasks. However, LLMs applications are highly vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, which poses a critical problem. These attacks target LLMs applications through using carefully designed input prompts to divert the model from adhering to original instruction, thereby it could execute unintended actions. These manipulations pose serious security threats which potentially results in data leaks, biased outputs, or harmful responses. This project explores the security vulnerabilities in relation to prompt injection attacks. To detect whether a prompt is vulnerable or not, we follows two approaches: 1) a pre-trained LLM, and 2) a fine-tuned LLM. Then, we conduct a thorough analysis and comparison of the classification performance. Firstly, we use pre-trained XLM-RoBERTa model to detect prompt injections using test dataset without any fine-tuning and evaluate it by zero-shot classification. Then, this proposed work will apply supervised fine-tuning to this pre-trained LLM using a task-specific labeled dataset from deepset in huggingface, and this fine-tuned model achieves impressive results with 99.13\% accuracy, 100\% precision, 98.33\% recall and 99.15\% F1-score thorough rigorous experimentation and evaluation. We observe that our approach is highly efficient in detecting prompt injection attacks.</description>

      <title>FinTeamExperts: Role Specialized MOEs For Financial Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Phi3 and Llama-3, are leading a significant leap in AI, as they can generalize knowledge from their training to new tasks without fine-tuning. However, their application in the financial domain remains relatively limited. The financial field is inherently complex, requiring a deep understanding across various perspectives, from macro, micro economic trend to quantitative analysis. Motivated by this complexity, a mixture of expert LLMs tailored to specific financial domains could offer a more comprehensive understanding for intricate financial tasks. In this paper, we present the FinTeamExperts, a role-specialized LLM framework structured as a Mixture of Experts (MOEs) for financial analysis. The framework simulates a collaborative team setting by training each model to specialize in distinct roles: Macro Analysts, Micro analysts, and Quantitative Analysts. This role-specific specialization enhances the model's ability to integrate their domain-specific expertise. We achieve this by training three 8-billion parameter models on different corpus, each dedicated to excelling in specific finance-related roles. We then instruct-tune FinTeamExperts on downstream tasks to align with practical financial tasks. The experimental results show that FinTeamExperts outperform all models of the same size and larger on three out of four datasets. On the fourth dataset, which presents a more complex task, FinTeamExperts still surpass all models of the same size. This highlights the success of our role-based specialization approach and the continued training approach for FinTeamExperts.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Benchmarks in Medical Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing application of large language models (LLMs) in the medical domain, evaluating these models' performance using benchmark datasets has become crucial. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of various benchmark datasets employed in medical LLM tasks. These datasets span multiple modalities including text, image, and multimodal benchmarks, focusing on different aspects of medical knowledge such as electronic health records (EHRs), doctor-patient dialogues, medical question-answering, and medical image captioning. The survey categorizes the datasets by modality, discussing their significance, data structure, and impact on the development of LLMs for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, report generation, and predictive decision support. Key benchmarks include MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, BioASQ, PubMedQA, and CheXpert, which have facilitated advancements in tasks like medical report generation, clinical summarization, and synthetic data generation. The paper summarizes the challenges and opportunities in leveraging these benchmarks for advancing multimodal medical intelligence, emphasizing the need for datasets with a greater degree of language diversity, structured omics data, and innovative approaches to synthesis. This work also provides a foundation for future research in the application of LLMs in medicine, contributing to the evolving field of medical artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>LLMCBench: Benchmarking Large Language Model Compression for Efficient Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their strong intelligence ability, the high demand for computation and storage hinders their practical application. To this end, many model compression techniques are proposed to increase the efficiency of LLMs. However, current researches only validate their methods on limited models, datasets, metrics, etc, and still lack a comprehensive evaluation under more general scenarios. So it is still a question of which model compression approach we should use under a specific case. To mitigate this gap, we present the Large Language Model Compression Benchmark (LLMCBench), a rigorously designed benchmark with an in-depth analysis for LLM compression algorithms. We first analyze the actual model production requirements and carefully design evaluation tracks and metrics. Then, we conduct extensive experiments and comparison using multiple mainstream LLM compression approaches. Finally, we perform an in-depth analysis based on the evaluation and provide useful insight for LLM compression design. We hope our LLMCBench can contribute insightful suggestions for LLM compression algorithm design and serve as a foundation for future research. Our code is available at https://github.com/AboveParadise/LLMCBench.</description>

      <title>Causal Interventions on Causal Paths: Mapping GPT-2's Reasoning From Syntax to Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While interpretability research has shed light on some internal algorithms utilized by transformer-based LLMs, reasoning in natural language, with its deep contextuality and ambiguity, defies easy categorization. As a result, formulating clear and motivating questions for circuit analysis that rely on well-defined in-domain and out-of-domain examples required for causal interventions is challenging. Although significant work has investigated circuits for specific tasks, such as indirect object identification (IOI), deciphering natural language reasoning through circuits remains difficult due to its inherent complexity. In this work, we take initial steps to characterize causal reasoning in LLMs by analyzing clear-cut cause-and-effect sentences like "I opened an umbrella because it started raining," where causal interventions may be possible through carefully crafted scenarios using GPT-2 small. Our findings indicate that causal syntax is localized within the first 2-3 layers, while certain heads in later layers exhibit heightened sensitivity to nonsensical variations of causal sentences. This suggests that models may infer reasoning by (1) detecting syntactic cues and (2) isolating distinct heads in the final layers that focus on semantic relationships.</description>

      <title>Energy-Based Diffusion Language Models for Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in autoregressive language models, alternative generative paradigms beyond left-to-right generation are still being actively explored. Discrete diffusion models, with the capacity for parallel generation, have recently emerged as a promising alternative. Unfortunately, these models still underperform the autoregressive counterparts, with the performance gap increasing when reducing the number of sampling steps. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is a consequence of an imperfect approximation used by diffusion models. In this work, we propose Energy-based Diffusion Language Model (EDLM), an energy-based model operating at the full sequence level for each diffusion step, introduced to improve the underlying approximation used by diffusion models. More specifically, we introduce an EBM in a residual form, and show that its parameters can be obtained by leveraging a pretrained autoregressive model or by finetuning a bidirectional transformer via noise contrastive estimation. We also propose an efficient generation algorithm via parallel important sampling. Comprehensive experiments on language modeling benchmarks show that our model can consistently outperform state-of-the-art diffusion models by a significant margin, and approaches autoregressive models' perplexity. We further show that, without any generation performance drop, our framework offers a 1.3$\times$ sampling speedup over existing diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Can Machines Think Like Humans? A Behavioral Evaluation of LLM-Agents in Dictator Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents increasingly undertake real-world tasks and engage with human society, how well do we understand their behaviors? This study (1) investigates how LLM agents' prosocial behaviors -- a fundamental social norm -- can be induced by different personas and benchmarked against human behaviors; and (2) introduces a behavioral approach to evaluate the performance of LLM agents in complex decision-making scenarios. We explored how different personas and experimental framings affect these AI agents' altruistic behavior in dictator games and compared their behaviors within the same LLM family, across various families, and with human behaviors. Our findings reveal substantial variations and inconsistencies among LLMs and notable differences compared to human behaviors. Merely assigning a human-like identity to LLMs does not produce human-like behaviors. Despite being trained on extensive human-generated data, these AI agents cannot accurately predict human decisions. LLM agents are not able to capture the internal processes of human decision-making, and their alignment with human behavior is highly variable and dependent on specific model architectures and prompt formulations; even worse, such dependence does not follow a clear pattern.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Automatic Credibility Assessment of Textual Credibility Signals in the Era of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current era of social media and generative AI, an ability to automatically assess the credibility of online social media content is of tremendous importance. Credibility assessment is fundamentally based on aggregating credibility signals, which refer to small units of information, such as content factuality, bias, or a presence of persuasion techniques, into an overall credibility score. Credibility signals provide a more granular, more easily explainable and widely utilizable information in contrast to currently predominant fake news detection, which utilizes various (mostly latent) features. A growing body of research on automatic credibility assessment and detection of credibility signals can be characterized as highly fragmented and lacking mutual interconnections. This issue is even more prominent due to a lack of an up-to-date overview of research works on automatic credibility assessment. In this survey, we provide such systematic and comprehensive literature review of 175 research papers while focusing on textual credibility signals and Natural Language Processing (NLP), which undergoes a significant advancement due to Large Language Models (LLMs). While positioning the NLP research into the context of other multidisciplinary research works, we tackle with approaches for credibility assessment as well as with 9 categories of credibility signals (we provide a thorough analysis for 3 of them, namely: 1) factuality, subjectivity and bias, 2) persuasion techniques and logical fallacies, and 3) claims and veracity). Following the description of the existing methods, datasets and tools, we identify future challenges and opportunities, while paying a specific attention to recent rapid development of generative AI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Question Answering (MMQA) is crucial as it enables comprehensive understanding and accurate responses by integrating insights from diverse data representations such as tables, charts, and text. Most existing researches in MMQA only focus on two modalities such as image-text QA, table-text QA and chart-text QA, and there remains a notable scarcity in studies that investigate the joint analysis of text, tables, and charts. In this paper, we present C$\text{T}^2$C-QA, a pioneering Chinese reasoning-based QA dataset that includes an extensive collection of text, tables, and charts, meticulously compiled from 200 selectively sourced webpages. Our dataset simulates real webpages and serves as a great test for the capability of the model to analyze and reason with multimodal data, because the answer to a question could appear in various modalities, or even potentially not exist at all. Additionally, we present AED (\textbf{A}llocating, \textbf{E}xpert and \textbf{D}esicion), a multi-agent system implemented through collaborative deployment, information interaction, and collective decision-making among different agents. Specifically, the Assignment Agent is in charge of selecting and activating expert agents, including those proficient in text, tables, and charts. The Decision Agent bears the responsibility of delivering the final verdict, drawing upon the analytical insights provided by these expert agents. We execute a comprehensive analysis, comparing AED with various state-of-the-art models in MMQA, including GPT-4. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that current methodologies, including GPT-4, are yet to meet the benchmarks set by our dataset.</description>

      <title>UFT: Unifying Fine-Tuning of SFT and RLHF/DPO/UNA through a Generalized Implicit Reward Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By pretraining on trillions of tokens, an LLM gains the capability of text generation. However, to enhance its utility and reduce potential harm, SFT and alignment are applied sequentially to the pretrained model. Due to the differing nature and objective functions of SFT and alignment, catastrophic forgetting has become a significant issue. To address this, we introduce Unified Fine-Tuning (UFT), which integrates SFT and alignment into a single training stage using the same objective and loss functions through an implicit reward function. Our experimental results demonstrate that UFT outperforms SFT on instruction-tuning data alone. Moreover, when combining instruction-tuning data with alignment data, UFT effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting across these two stages and shows a clear advantage over sequentially applying SFT and alignment. This is evident in the significant improvements observed in the \textbf{ifeval} task for instruction-following and the \textbf{truthful-qa} task for factuality. The proposed general fine-tuning framework UFT establishes an effective and efficient pretraining-UFT paradigm for LLM training.</description>

      <title>Estimating Causal Effects of Text Interventions Leveraging LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the effect of textual interventions in social systems, such as reducing anger in social media posts to see its impact on engagement, poses significant challenges. Direct interventions on real-world systems are often infeasible, necessitating reliance on observational data. Traditional causal inference methods, typically designed for binary or discrete treatments, are inadequate for handling the complex, high-dimensional nature of textual data. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel approach, CausalDANN, to estimate causal effects using text transformations facilitated by large language models (LLMs). Unlike existing methods, our approach accommodates arbitrary textual interventions and leverages text-level classifiers with domain adaptation ability to produce robust effect estimates against domain shifts, even when only the control group is observed. This flexibility in handling various text interventions is a key advancement in causal estimation for textual data, offering opportunities to better understand human behaviors and develop effective policies within social systems.</description>

      <title>TransformLLM: Adapting Large Language Models via LLM-Transformed Reading Comprehension Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in highly-specialized domains, however challenges are still present in aspects of accuracy and costs. These limitations restrict the usage of existing models in domain-specific tasks. While fine-tuning pre-trained models have shown promising results, this process can be computationally expensive and require massive datasets of the specialized application in hand. In this work, we bridge that gap. We have developed Phi-2-Legal and Mistral-Legal-7B, which are language models specifically designed for legal applications. These models are based on Phi-2 and Mistral-7B-v0.1, and have gone through continued pre-training with over 500 million tokens of legal texts. Our innovative approach significantly improves capabilities in legal tasks by using Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert raw training data into reading comprehension text. Our legal LLMs have demonstrated superior performance in legal benchmarks, even outperforming models trained on much larger datasets with more resources. This work emphasizes the effectiveness of continued pre-training on domain-specific texts, while using affordable LLMs for data conversion, which gives these models domain expertise while retaining general language understanding capabilities. While this work uses the legal domain as a test case, our method can be scaled and applied to any pre-training dataset, resulting in significant improvements across different tasks. These findings underscore the potential of domain-adaptive pre-training and reading comprehension for the development of highly effective domain-specific language models.</description>

      <title>SpeechQE: Estimating the Quality of Direct Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in automatic quality estimation for machine translation have exclusively focused on written language, leaving the speech modality underexplored. In this work, we formulate the task of quality estimation for speech translation (SpeechQE), construct a benchmark, and evaluate a family of systems based on cascaded and end-to-end architectures. In this process, we introduce a novel end-to-end system leveraging pre-trained text LLM. Results suggest that end-to-end approaches are better suited to estimating the quality of direct speech translation than using quality estimation systems designed for text in cascaded systems. More broadly, we argue that quality estimation of speech translation needs to be studied as a separate problem from that of text, and release our data and models to guide further research in this space.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Act as Symbolic Reasoners?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of Large language models (LLMs) across a broad range of domains has been impressive but have been critiqued as not being able to reason about their process and conclusions derived. This is to explain the conclusions draw, and also for determining a plan or strategy for their approach. This paper explores the current research in investigating symbolic reasoning and LLMs, and whether an LLM can inherently provide some form of reasoning or whether supporting components are necessary, and, if there is evidence for a reasoning capability, is this evident in a specific domain or is this a general capability? In addition, this paper aims to identify the current research gaps and future trends of LLM explainability, presenting a review of the literature, identifying current research into this topic and suggests areas for future work.</description>

      <title>RoBIn: A Transformer-Based Model For Risk Of Bias Inference With Machine Reading Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Scientific publications play a crucial role in uncovering insights, testing novel drugs, and shaping healthcare policies. Accessing the quality of publications requires evaluating their Risk of Bias (RoB), a process typically conducted by human reviewers. In this study, we introduce a new dataset for machine reading comprehension and RoB assessment and present RoBIn (Risk of Bias Inference), an innovative model crafted to automate such evaluation. The model employs a dual-task approach, extracting evidence from a given context and assessing the RoB based on the gathered evidence. Methods: We use data from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) as ground truth to label open-access clinical trial publications from PubMed. This process enabled us to develop training and test datasets specifically for machine reading comprehension and RoB inference. Additionally, we created extractive (RoBInExt) and generative (RoBInGen) Transformer-based approaches to extract relevant evidence and classify the RoB effectively. Results: RoBIn is evaluated across various settings and benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods for RoB inference, including large language models in multiple scenarios. In most cases, the best-performing RoBIn variant surpasses traditional machine learning and LLM-based approaches, achieving an ROC AUC of 0.83. Conclusion: Based on the evidence extracted from clinical trial reports, RoBIn performs a binary classification to decide whether the trial is at a low RoB or a high/unclear RoB. We found that both RoBInGen and RoBInExt are robust and have the best results in many settings.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the problems of Question Answering (QA) and Named Entity Recognition (NER) in five diverse languages. We tested five Large Language Models with various prompting methods, including zero-shot, chain-of-thought reasoning, and translation techniques. Our results show that while some models consistently outperform others, their effectiveness varies significantly across tasks and languages. We saw that advanced prompting techniques generally improved QA performance but had mixed results for NER; and we observed that language difficulty patterns differed between tasks. Our findings highlight the need for task-specific approaches in multilingual NLP and suggest that current models may develop different linguistic competencies for different tasks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Training of Sparse Autoencoders for Large Language Models via Layer Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse AutoEnocders (SAEs) have recently been employed as an unsupervised approach for understanding the inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs). They reconstruct the model's activations with a sparse linear combination of interpretable features. However, training SAEs is computationally intensive, especially as models grow in size and complexity. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training strategy that reduces the number of trained SAEs from one per layer to one for a given group of contiguous layers. Our experimental results on Pythia 160M highlight a speedup of up to 6x without compromising the reconstruction quality and performance on downstream tasks. Therefore, layer clustering presents an efficient approach to train SAEs in modern LLMs.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Context-Aware Criteria in Self-Assessing LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) as evaluators has garnered significant attention due to their potential to rival human-level evaluations in long-form response assessments. However, current LLM evaluators rely heavily on static, human-defined criteria, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse generative tasks and incorporate context-specific knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel Self-Assessing LLM framework that integrates Context-Aware Criteria (SALC) with dynamic knowledge tailored to each evaluation instance. This instance-level knowledge enhances the LLM evaluator's performance by providing relevant and context-aware insights that pinpoint the important criteria specific to the current instance. Additionally, the proposed framework adapts seamlessly to various tasks without relying on predefined human criteria, offering a more flexible evaluation approach. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing baseline evaluation frameworks, yielding improvements on average 4.8% across a wide variety of datasets. Furthermore, by leveraging knowledge distillation techniques, we fine-tuned smaller language models for criteria generation and evaluation, achieving comparable or superior performance to larger models with much lower cost. Our method also exhibits a improvement in LC Win-Rate in AlpacaEval2 leaderboard up to a 12% when employed for preference data generation in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), underscoring its efficacy as a robust and scalable evaluation framework.</description>

      <title>MultiTok: Variable-Length Tokenization for Efficient LLMs Adapted from LZW Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have drastically changed the prospects of AI by introducing technologies for more complex natural language processing. However, current methodologies to train such LLMs require extensive resources including but not limited to large amounts of data, expensive machinery, and lengthy training. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new tokenization method inspired by universal Lempel-Ziv-Welch data compression that compresses repetitive phrases into multi-word tokens. With MultiTok as a new tokenizing tool, we show that language models are able to be trained notably more efficiently while offering a similar accuracy on more succinct and compressed training data. In fact, our results demonstrate that MultiTok achieves a comparable performance to the BERT standard as a tokenizer while also providing close to 2.5x faster training with more than 30% less training data.</description>

      <title>Thank You, Stingray: Multilingual Large Language Models Can Not (Yet) Disambiguate Cross-Lingual Word Sense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) have gained prominence, but concerns arise regarding their reliability beyond English. This study addresses the gap in cross-lingual semantic evaluation by introducing a novel benchmark for cross-lingual sense disambiguation, StingrayBench. In this paper, we demonstrate using false friends -- words that are orthographically similar but have completely different meanings in two languages -- as a possible approach to pinpoint the limitation of cross-lingual sense disambiguation in LLMs. We collect false friends in four language pairs, namely Indonesian-Malay, Indonesian-Tagalog, Chinese-Japanese, and English-German; and challenge LLMs to distinguish the use of them in context. In our analysis of various models, we observe they tend to be biased toward higher-resource languages. We also propose new metrics for quantifying the cross-lingual sense bias and comprehension based on our benchmark. Our work contributes to developing more diverse and inclusive language modeling, promoting fairer access for the wider multilingual community.</description>

      <title>Reducing the Scope of Language Models with Circuit Breakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models are now deployed in a wide variety of user-facing applications, often for specific purposes like answering questions about documentation or acting as coding assistants. As these models are intended for particular purposes, they should not be able to answer irrelevant queries like requests for poetry or questions about physics, or even worse, queries that can only be answered by humans like sensitive company policies. Instead we would like them to only answer queries corresponding to desired behavior and refuse all other requests, which we refer to as scoping. We find that, despite the use of system prompts, two representative language models can be poorly scoped and respond to queries they should not be addressing. We then conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of methods which could be used for scoping the behavior of language models. Among many other results, we show that a recently-proposed method for general alignment, Circuit Breakers (CB), can be adapted to scope language models to very specific tasks like sentiment analysis or summarization or even tasks with finer-grained scoping (e.g. summarizing only news articles). When compared to standard methods like fine-tuning or preference learning, CB is more robust both for out of distribution tasks, and to adversarial prompting techniques. We also show that layering SFT and CB together often results in the best of both worlds: improved performance only on relevant queries, while rejecting irrelevant ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate persona-driven conversations between Players and Non-Player Characters (NPC) in games. Showcasing the application of our methodology, we introduce the Minecraft Persona-driven Dialogue dataset (MCPDial). Starting with a small seed of expert-written conversations, we employ our method to generate hundreds of additional conversations. Each conversation in the dataset includes rich character descriptions of the player and NPC. The conversations are long, allowing for in-depth and extensive interactions between the player and NPC. MCPDial extends beyond basic conversations by incorporating canonical function calls (e.g. "Call find a resource on iron ore") between the utterances. Finally, we conduct a qualitative analysis of the dataset to assess its quality and characteristics.</description>

      <title>Are Paraphrases Generated by Large Language Models Invertible?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models can produce highly fluent paraphrases while retaining much of the original meaning. While this capability has a variety of helpful applications, it may also be abused by bad actors, for example to plagiarize content or to conceal their identity. This motivates us to consider the problem of paraphrase inversion: given a paraphrased document, attempt to recover the original text. To explore the feasibility of this task, we fine-tune paraphrase inversion models, both with and without additional author-specific context to help guide the inversion process. We explore two approaches to author-specific inversion: one using in-context examples of the target author's writing, and another using learned style representations that capture distinctive features of the author's style. We show that, when starting from paraphrased machine-generated text, we can recover significant portions of the document using a learned inversion model. When starting from human-written text, the variety of source writing styles poses a greater challenge for invertability. However, even when the original tokens can't be recovered, we find the inverted text is stylistically similar to the original, which significantly improves the performance of plagiarism detectors and authorship identification systems that rely on stylistic markers.</description>

      <title>$f$-PO: Generalizing Preference Optimization with $f$-divergence Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preference optimization has made significant progress recently, with numerous methods developed to align language models with human preferences. This paper introduces $f$-divergence Preference Optimization ($f$-PO), a novel framework that generalizes and extends existing approaches. $f$-PO minimizes $f$-divergences between the optimized policy and the optimal policy, encompassing a broad family of alignment methods using various divergences. Our approach unifies previous algorithms like DPO and EXO, while offering new variants through different choices of $f$-divergences. We provide theoretical analysis of $f$-PO's properties and conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art language models using benchmark datasets. Results demonstrate $f$-PO's effectiveness across various tasks, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods on popular benchmarks such as AlpacaEval 2, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench. Additionally, we present ablation studies exploring the impact of different $f$-divergences, offering insights into the trade-offs between regularization and performance in offline preference optimization. Our work contributes both practical algorithms and theoretical understanding to the field of language model alignment. Code is available at https://github.com/MinkaiXu/fPO.</description>

      <title>CFSafety: Comprehensive Fine-grained Safety Assessment for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly evolve, they bring significant conveniences to our work and daily lives, but also introduce considerable safety risks. These models can generate texts with social biases or unethical content, and under specific adversarial instructions, may even incite illegal activities. Therefore, rigorous safety assessments of LLMs are crucial. In this work, we introduce a safety assessment benchmark, CFSafety, which integrates 5 classic safety scenarios and 5 types of instruction attacks, totaling 10 categories of safety questions, to form a test set with 25k prompts. This test set was used to evaluate the natural language generation (NLG) capabilities of LLMs, employing a combination of simple moral judgment and a 1-5 safety rating scale for scoring. Using this benchmark, we tested eight popular LLMs, including the GPT series. The results indicate that while GPT-4 demonstrated superior safety performance, the safety effectiveness of LLMs, including this model, still requires improvement. The data and code associated with this study are available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Approach to Harnessing the Power of LLMs in Authorship Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Authorship attribution aims to identify the origin or author of a document. Traditional approaches have heavily relied on manual features and fail to capture long-range correlations, limiting their effectiveness. Recent advancements leverage text embeddings from pre-trained language models, which require significant fine-tuning on labeled data, posing challenges in data dependency and limited interpretability. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their deep reasoning capabilities and ability to maintain long-range textual associations, offer a promising alternative. This study explores the potential of pre-trained LLMs in one-shot authorship attribution, specifically utilizing Bayesian approaches and probability outputs of LLMs. Our methodology calculates the probability that a text entails previous writings of an author, reflecting a more nuanced understanding of authorship. By utilizing only pre-trained models such as Llama-3-70B, our results on the IMDb and blog datasets show an impressive 85\% accuracy in one-shot authorship classification across ten authors. Our findings set new baselines for one-shot authorship analysis using LLMs and expand the application scope of these models in forensic linguistics. This work also includes extensive ablation studies to validate our approach.</description>

      <title>Let's Be Self-generated via Step by Step: A Curriculum Learning Approach to Automated Reasoning with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting approaches have significantly consolidated the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), they still face limitations that require extensive human effort or have performance needs to be improved. Existing endeavors have focused on bridging these gaps; however, these approaches either hinge on external data and cannot completely eliminate manual effort, or they fall short in effectively directing LLMs to generate high-quality exemplary prompts. To address the said pitfalls, we propose a novel prompt approach for automatic reasoning named \textbf{LBS3}, inspired by curriculum learning which better reflects human learning habits. Specifically, LBS3 initially steers LLMs to recall easy-to-hard proxy queries that are pertinent to the target query. Following this, it invokes a progressive strategy that utilizes exemplary prompts stemmed from easy-proxy queries to direct LLMs in solving hard-proxy queries, enabling the high-quality of the proxy solutions. Finally, our extensive experiments in various reasoning-intensive tasks with varying open- and closed-source LLMs show that LBS3 achieves strongly competitive performance compared to the SOTA baselines.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Financial Question Answering with a Multi-Agent Reflection Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in numerous Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, they still struggle with financial question answering (QA), particularly when numerical reasoning is required. Recently, LLM-based multi-agent frameworks have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in multi-step reasoning, which is crucial for financial QA tasks as it involves extracting relevant information from tables and text and then performing numerical reasoning on the extracted data to infer answers. In this study, we propose a multi-agent framework incorporating a critic agent that reflects on the reasoning steps and final answers for each question. Additionally, we enhance our system by adding multiple critic agents, each focusing on a specific aspect of the answer. Our results indicate that this framework significantly improves performance compared to single-agent reasoning, with an average performance increase of 15% for the LLaMA3-8B model and 5% for the LLaMA3-70B model. Furthermore, our framework performs on par with, and in some cases surpasses, larger single-agent LLMs such as LLaMA3.1-405B and GPT-4o-mini, though it falls slightly short compared to Claude-3.5 Sonnet. Overall, our framework presents an effective solution to enhance open-source LLMs for financial QA tasks, offering a cost-effective alternative to larger models like Claude-3.5 Sonnet.</description>

      <title>Learning and Unlearning of Fabricated Knowledge in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What happens when a new piece of knowledge is introduced into the training data and how long does it last while a large language model (LM) continues to train? We investigate this question by injecting facts into LMs from a new probing dataset, "Outlandish", which is designed to permit the testing of a spectrum of different fact types. When studying how robust these memories are, there appears to be a sweet spot in the spectrum of fact novelty between consistency with world knowledge and total randomness, where the injected memory is the most enduring. Specifically we show that facts that conflict with common knowledge are remembered for tens of thousands of training steps, while prompts not conflicting with common knowledge (mundane), as well as scrambled prompts (randomly jumbled) are both forgotten much more rapidly. Further, knowledge-conflicting facts can "prime'' how the language model hallucinates on logically unrelated prompts, showing their propensity for non-target generalization, while both mundane and randomly jumbled facts prime significantly less. Finally, we show that impacts of knowledge-conflicting facts in LMs, though they can be long lasting, can be largely erased by novel application of multi-step sparse updates, even while the training ability of the model is preserved. As such, this very simple procedure has direct implications for mitigating the effects of data poisoning in training.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLMs for Hypothetical Deduction in Logical Inference: A Neuro-Symbolic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable potential across a wide array of reasoning tasks, including logical reasoning. Although massive efforts have been made to empower the logical reasoning ability of LLMs via external logical symbolic solvers, crucial challenges of the poor generalization ability to questions with different features and inevitable question information loss of symbolic solver-driven approaches remain unresolved. To mitigate these issues, we introduce LINA, a LLM-driven neuro-symbolic approach for faithful logical reasoning. By enabling an LLM to autonomously perform the transition from propositional logic extraction to sophisticated logical reasoning, LINA not only bolsters the resilience of the reasoning process but also eliminates the dependency on external solvers. Additionally, through its adoption of a hypothetical-deductive reasoning paradigm, LINA effectively circumvents the expansive search space challenge that plagues traditional forward reasoning methods. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LINA substantially outperforms both established propositional logic frameworks and conventional prompting techniques across a spectrum of five logical reasoning tasks. Specifically, LINA achieves an improvement of 24.34% over LINC on the FOLIO dataset, while also surpassing prompting strategies like CoT and CoT-SC by up to 24.02%.

      <title>Enhancing Adversarial Attacks through Chain of Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various domains but remain susceptible to safety concerns. Prior research indicates that gradient-based adversarial attacks are particularly effective against aligned LLMs and the chain of thought (CoT) prompting can elicit desired answers through step-by-step reasoning. This paper proposes enhancing the robustness of adversarial attacks on aligned LLMs by integrating CoT prompts with the greedy coordinate gradient (GCG) technique. Using CoT triggers instead of affirmative targets stimulates the reasoning abilities of backend LLMs, thereby improving the transferability and universality of adversarial attacks. We conducted an ablation study comparing our CoT-GCG approach with Amazon Web Services auto-cot. Results revealed our approach outperformed both the baseline GCG attack and CoT prompting. Additionally, we used Llama Guard to evaluate potentially harmful interactions, providing a more objective risk assessment of entire conversations compared to matching outputs to rejection phrases.

      <title>SimSiam Naming Game: A Unified Approach for Representation Learning and Emergent Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent communication, driven by generative models, enables agents to develop a shared language for describing their individual views of the same objects through interactions. Meanwhile, self-supervised learning (SSL), particularly SimSiam, uses discriminative representation learning to make representations of augmented views of the same data point closer in the representation space. Building on the prior work of VI-SimSiam, which incorporates a generative and Bayesian perspective into the SimSiam framework via variational inference (VI) interpretation, we propose SimSiam+VAE, a unified approach for both representation learning and emergent communication. SimSiam+VAE integrates a variational autoencoder (VAE) into the predictor of the SimSiam network to enhance representation learning and capture uncertainty. Experimental results show that SimSiam+VAE outperforms both SimSiam and VI-SimSiam. We further extend this model into a communication framework called the SimSiam Naming Game (SSNG), which applies the generative and Bayesian approach based on VI to develop internal representations and emergent language, while utilizing the discriminative process of SimSiam to facilitate mutual understanding between agents. In experiments with established models, despite the dynamic alternation of agent roles during interactions, SSNG demonstrates comparable performance to the referential game and slightly outperforms the Metropolis-Hastings naming game.</description>

      <title>Self-Preference Bias in LLM-as-a-Judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated evaluation leveraging large language models (LLMs), commonly referred to as LLM evaluators or LLM-as-a-judge, has been widely used in measuring the performance of dialogue systems. However, the self-preference bias in LLMs has posed significant risks, including promoting specific styles or policies intrinsic to the LLMs. Despite the importance of this issue, there is a lack of established methods to measure the self-preference bias quantitatively, and its underlying causes are poorly understood. In this paper, we introduce a novel quantitative metric to measure the self-preference bias. Our experimental results demonstrate that GPT-4 exhibits a significant degree of self-preference bias. To explore the causes, we hypothesize that LLMs may favor outputs that are more familiar to them, as indicated by lower perplexity. We analyze the relationship between LLM evaluations and the perplexities of outputs. Our findings reveal that LLMs assign significantly higher evaluations to outputs with lower perplexity than human evaluators, regardless of whether the outputs were self-generated. This suggests that the essence of the bias lies in perplexity and that the self-preference bias exists because LLMs prefer texts more familiar to them.</description>

      <title>Multi-aspect Depression Severity Assessment via Inductive Dialogue System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of chatbots and the growing demand for automatic depression detection, identifying depression in patient conversations has gained more attention. However, prior methods often assess depression in a binary way or only a single score without diverse feedback and lack focus on enhancing dialogue responses. In this paper, we present a novel task of multi-aspect depression severity assessment via an inductive dialogue system (MaDSA), evaluating a patient's depression level on multiple criteria by incorporating an assessment-aided response generation. Further, we propose a foundational system for MaDSA, which induces psychological dialogue responses with an auxiliary emotion classification task within a hierarchical severity assessment structure. We synthesize the conversational dataset annotated with eight aspects of depression severity alongside emotion labels, proven robust via human evaluations. Experimental results show potential for our preliminary work on MaDSA.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming and Speaker-Attributed ASR for Real Distant-Microphone Meeting Transcription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distant-microphone meeting transcription is a challenging task. State-of-the-art end-to-end speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (SA-ASR) architectures lack a multichannel noise and reverberation reduction front-end, which limits their performance. In this paper, we introduce a joint beamforming and SA-ASR approach for real meeting transcription. We first describe a data alignment and augmentation method to pretrain a neural beamformer on real meeting data. We then compare fixed, hybrid, and fully neural beamformers as front-ends to the SA-ASR model. Finally, we jointly optimize the fully neural beamformer and the SA-ASR model. Experiments on the real AMI corpus show that,while state-of-the-art multi-frame cross-channel attention based channel fusion fails to improve ASR performance, fine-tuning SA-ASR on the fixed beamformer's output and jointly fine-tuning SA-ASR with the neural beamformer reduce the word error rate by 8% and 9% relative, respectively.</description>

      <title>Improving In-Context Learning with Small Language Model Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across various tasks, but their performance on domain-specific tasks remains limited. While methods like retrieval augmented generation and fine-tuning can help to address this, they require significant resources. In-context learning (ICL) is a cheap and efficient alternative but cannot match the accuracies of advanced methods. We present Ensemble SuperICL, a novel approach that enhances ICL by leveraging the expertise of multiple fine-tuned small language models (SLMs). Ensemble SuperICL achieves state of the art (SoTA) results on several natural language understanding benchmarks. Additionally, we test it on a medical-domain labelling task and showcase its practicality by using off-the-shelf SLMs fine-tuned on a general language task, achieving superior accuracy in large-scale data labelling compared to all baselines. Finally, we conduct an ablation study and sensitivity analyses to elucidate the underlying mechanism of Ensemble SuperICL. Our research contributes to the growing demand for efficient domain specialisation methods in LLMs, offering a cheap and effective method for practitioners.</description>

      <title>SceneGenAgent: Precise Industrial Scene Generation with Coding Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modeling of industrial scenes is essential for simulations in industrial manufacturing. While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in generating general 3D scenes from textual descriptions, generating industrial scenes with LLMs poses a unique challenge due to their demand for precise measurements and positioning, requiring complex planning over spatial arrangement. To address this challenge, we introduce SceneGenAgent, an LLM-based agent for generating industrial scenes through C# code. SceneGenAgent ensures precise layout planning through a structured and calculable format, layout verification, and iterative refinement to meet the quantitative requirements of industrial scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate that LLMs powered by SceneGenAgent exceed their original performance, reaching up to 81.0% success rate in real-world industrial scene generation tasks and effectively meeting most scene generation requirements. To further enhance accessibility, we construct SceneInstruct, a dataset designed for fine-tuning open-source LLMs to integrate into SceneGenAgent. Experiments show that fine-tuning open-source LLMs on SceneInstruct yields significant performance improvements, with Llama3.1-70B approaching the capabilities of GPT-4o. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/THUDM/SceneGenAgent .</description>

      <title>Beyond Text: Optimizing RAG with Multimodal Inputs for Industrial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in answering questions, but they lack domain-specific knowledge and are prone to hallucinations. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is one approach to address these challenges, while multimodal models are emerging as promising AI assistants for processing both text and images. In this paper we describe a series of experiments aimed at determining how to best integrate multimodal models into RAG systems for the industrial domain. The purpose of the experiments is to determine whether including images alongside text from documents within the industrial domain increases RAG performance and to find the optimal configuration for such a multimodal RAG system. Our experiments include two approaches for image processing and retrieval, as well as two LLMs (GPT4-Vision and LLaVA) for answer synthesis. These image processing strategies involve the use of multimodal embeddings and the generation of textual summaries from images. We evaluate our experiments with an LLM-as-a-Judge approach. Our results reveal that multimodal RAG can outperform single-modality RAG settings, although image retrieval poses a greater challenge than text retrieval. Additionally, leveraging textual summaries from images presents a more promising approach compared to the use of multimodal embeddings, providing more opportunities for future advancements.</description>

      <title>SG-Bench: Evaluating LLM Safety Generalization Across Diverse Tasks and Prompt Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of large language model (LLM) applications is essential for developing trustworthy artificial intelligence. Current LLM safety benchmarks have two limitations. First, they focus solely on either discriminative or generative evaluation paradigms while ignoring their interconnection. Second, they rely on standardized inputs, overlooking the effects of widespread prompting techniques, such as system prompts, few-shot demonstrations, and chain-of-thought prompting. To overcome these issues, we developed SG-Bench, a novel benchmark to assess the generalization of LLM safety across various tasks and prompt types. This benchmark integrates both generative and discriminative evaluation tasks and includes extended data to examine the impact of prompt engineering and jailbreak on LLM safety. Our assessment of 3 advanced proprietary LLMs and 10 open-source LLMs with the benchmark reveals that most LLMs perform worse on discriminative tasks than generative ones, and are highly susceptible to prompts, indicating poor generalization in safety alignment. We also explain these findings quantitatively and qualitatively to provide insights for future research.</description>

      <title>Not All Languages are Equal: Insights into Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RALMs (Retrieval-Augmented Language Models) broaden their knowledge scope by incorporating external textual resources. However, the multilingual nature of global knowledge necessitates RALMs to handle diverse languages, a topic that has received limited research focus. In this work, we propose \textit{Futurepedia}, a carefully crafted benchmark containing parallel texts across eight representative languages. We evaluate six multilingual RALMs using our benchmark to explore the challenges of multilingual RALMs. Experimental results reveal linguistic inequalities: 1) high-resource languages stand out in Monolingual Knowledge Extraction; 2) Indo-European languages lead RALMs to provide answers directly from documents, alleviating the challenge of expressing answers across languages; 3) English benefits from RALMs' selection bias and speaks louder in multilingual knowledge selection. Based on these findings, we offer advice for improving multilingual Retrieval Augmented Generation. For monolingual knowledge extraction, careful attention must be paid to cascading errors from translating low-resource languages into high-resource ones. In cross-lingual knowledge transfer, encouraging RALMs to provide answers within documents in different languages can improve transfer performance. For multilingual knowledge selection, incorporating more non-English documents and repositioning English documents can help mitigate RALMs' selection bias. Through comprehensive experiments, we underscore the complexities inherent in multilingual RALMs and offer valuable insights for future research.</description>

      <title>Are VLMs Really Blind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Language Models excel in handling a wide range of complex tasks, including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Visual Question Answering (VQA), and advanced geometric reasoning. However, these models fail to perform well on low-level basic visual tasks which are especially easy for humans. Our goal in this work was to determine if these models are truly "blind" to geometric reasoning or if there are ways to enhance their capabilities in this area. Our work presents a novel automatic pipeline designed to extract key information from images in response to specific questions. Instead of just relying on direct VQA, we use question-derived keywords to create a caption that highlights important details in the image related to the question. This caption is then used by a language model to provide a precise answer to the question without requiring external fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Sing it, Narrate it: Quality Musical Lyrics Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Translating lyrics for musicals presents unique challenges due to the need to ensure high translation quality while adhering to singability requirements such as length and rhyme. Existing song translation approaches often prioritize these singability constraints at the expense of translation quality, which is crucial for musicals. This paper aims to enhance translation quality while maintaining key singability features. Our method consists of three main components. First, we create a dataset to train reward models for the automatic evaluation of translation quality. Second, to enhance both singability and translation quality, we implement a two-stage training process with filtering techniques. Finally, we introduce an inference-time optimization framework for translating entire songs. Extensive experiments, including both automatic and human evaluations, demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods and validate the effectiveness of each component in our approach.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Ignorance from Error in LLM Hallucinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to hallucinations-outputs that are ungrounded, factually incorrect, or inconsistent with prior generations. We focus on close-book Question Answering (CBQA), where previous work has not fully addressed the distinction between two possible kinds of hallucinations, namely, whether the model (1) does not hold the correct answer in its parameters or (2) answers incorrectly despite having the required knowledge. We argue that distinguishing these cases is crucial for detecting and mitigating hallucinations. Specifically, case (2) may be mitigated by intervening in the model's internal computation, as the knowledge resides within the model's parameters. In contrast, in case (1) there is no parametric knowledge to leverage for mitigation, so it should be addressed by resorting to an external knowledge source or abstaining. To help distinguish between the two cases, we introduce Wrong Answer despite having Correct Knowledge (WACK), an approach for constructing model-specific datasets for the second hallucination type. Our probing experiments indicate that the two kinds of hallucinations are represented differently in the model's inner states. Next, we show that datasets constructed using WACK exhibit variations across models, demonstrating that even when models share knowledge of certain facts, they still vary in the specific examples that lead to hallucinations. Finally, we show that training a probe on our WACK datasets leads to better hallucination detection of case (2) hallucinations than using the common generic one-size-fits-all datasets.

      <title>Choosy Babies Need One Coach: Inducing Mode-Seeking Behavior in BabyLlama with Reverse KL Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents our submission to the Strict-Small Track of the 2nd BabyLM Challenge. We use a teacher-student distillation setup with the BabyLLaMa model (Timiryasov and Tastet, 2023) as a backbone. To make the student's learning process more focused, we replace the objective function with a reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, known to cause mode-seeking (rather than mode-averaging) behaviour in computational learners. We further experiment with having a single teacher (instead of an ensemble of two teachers) and implement additional optimization strategies to improve the distillation process. Our experiments show that under reverse KL divergence, a single-teacher model often outperforms or matches multiple-teacher models across most tasks. Additionally, incorporating advanced optimization techniques further enhances model performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach. These findings support our idea that "choosy babies need one coach".</description>

      <title>Joint Extraction and Classification of Danish Competences for Job Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The matching of competences, such as skills, occupations or knowledges, is a key desiderata for candidates to be fit for jobs. Automatic extraction of competences from CVs and Jobs can greatly promote recruiters' productivity in locating relevant candidates for job vacancies. This work presents the first model that jointly extracts and classifies competence from Danish job postings. Different from existing works on skill extraction and skill classification, our model is trained on a large volume of annotated Danish corpora and is capable of extracting a wide range of Danish competences, including skills, occupations and knowledges of different categories. More importantly, as a single BERT-like architecture for joint extraction and classification, our model is lightweight and efficient at inference. On a real-scenario job matching dataset, our model beats the state-of-the-art models in the overall performance of Danish competence extraction and classification, and saves over 50% time at inference.</description>

      <title>Protecting Privacy in Multimodal Large Language Models with MLLMU-Bench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models such as Large Language Models (LLM) and Multimodal Large Language models (MLLMs) trained on massive web corpora can memorize and disclose individuals' confidential and private data, raising legal and ethical concerns. While many previous works have addressed this issue in LLM via machine unlearning, it remains largely unexplored for MLLMs. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Multimodal Large Language Model Unlearning Benchmark (MLLMU-Bench), a novel benchmark aimed at advancing the understanding of multimodal machine unlearning. MLLMU-Bench consists of 500 fictitious profiles and 153 profiles for public celebrities, each profile feature over 14 customized question-answer pairs, evaluated from both multimodal (image+text) and unimodal (text) perspectives. The benchmark is divided into four sets to assess unlearning algorithms in terms of efficacy, generalizability, and model utility. Finally, we provide baseline results using existing generative model unlearning algorithms. Surprisingly, our experiments show that unimodal unlearning algorithms excel in generation and cloze tasks, while multimodal unlearning approaches perform better in classification tasks with multimodal inputs.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Inference Acceleration Strategies on Bias of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Last few years have seen unprecedented advances in capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). These advancements promise to deeply benefit a vast array of application domains. However, due to their immense size, performing inference with LLMs is both costly and slow. Consequently, a plethora of recent work has proposed strategies to enhance inference efficiency, e.g., quantization, pruning, and caching. These acceleration strategies reduce the inference cost and latency, often by several factors, while maintaining much of the predictive performance measured via common benchmarks. In this work, we explore another critical aspect of LLM performance: demographic bias in model generations due to inference acceleration optimizations. Using a wide range of metrics, we probe bias in model outputs from a number of angles. Analysis of outputs before and after inference acceleration shows significant change in bias. Worryingly, these bias effects are complex and unpredictable. A combination of an acceleration strategy and bias type may show little bias change in one model but may lead to a large effect in another. Our results highlight a need for in-depth and case-by-case evaluation of model bias after it has been modified to accelerate inference.</description>

      <title>AmpleGCG-Plus: A Strong Generative Model of Adversarial Suffixes to Jailbreak LLMs with Higher Success Rates in Fewer Attempts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned, they remain vulnerable to jailbreaking through either carefully crafted prompts in natural language or, interestingly, gibberish adversarial suffixes. However, gibberish tokens have received relatively less attention despite their success in attacking aligned LLMs. Recent work, AmpleGCG~\citep{liao2024amplegcg}, demonstrates that a generative model can quickly produce numerous customizable gibberish adversarial suffixes for any harmful query, exposing a range of alignment gaps in out-of-distribution (OOD) language spaces. To bring more attention to this area, we introduce AmpleGCG-Plus, an enhanced version that achieves better performance in fewer attempts. Through a series of exploratory experiments, we identify several training strategies to improve the learning of gibberish suffixes. Our results, verified under a strict evaluation setting, show that it outperforms AmpleGCG on both open-weight and closed-source models, achieving increases in attack success rate (ASR) of up to 17\% in the white-box setting against Llama-2-7B-chat, and more than tripling ASR in the black-box setting against GPT-4. Notably, AmpleGCG-Plus jailbreaks the newer GPT-4o series of models at similar rates to GPT-4, and, uncovers vulnerabilities against the recently proposed circuit breakers defense. We publicly release AmpleGCG-Plus along with our collected training datasets.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking LLM Guardrails in Handling Multilingual Toxicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the ubiquity of Large Language Models (LLMs), guardrails have become crucial to detect and defend against toxic content. However, with the increasing pervasiveness of LLMs in multilingual scenarios, their effectiveness in handling multilingual toxic inputs remains unclear. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive multilingual test suite, spanning seven datasets and over ten languages, to benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art guardrails. We also investigates the resilience of guardrails against recent jailbreaking techniques, and assess the impact of in-context safety policies and language resource availability on guardrails' performance. Our findings show that existing guardrails are still ineffective at handling multilingual toxicity and lack robustness against jailbreaking prompts. This work aims to identify the limitations of guardrails and to build a more reliable and trustworthy LLMs in multilingual scenarios.</description>

      <title>Very Attentive Tacotron: Robust and Unbounded Length Generalization in Autoregressive Transformer-Based Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) Transformer-based sequence models are known to have difficulty generalizing to sequences longer than those seen during training. When applied to text-to-speech (TTS), these models tend to drop or repeat words or produce erratic output, especially for longer utterances. In this paper, we introduce enhancements aimed at AR Transformer-based encoder-decoder TTS systems that address these robustness and length generalization issues. Our approach uses an alignment mechanism to provide cross-attention operations with relative location information. The associated alignment position is learned as a latent property of the model via backprop and requires no external alignment information during training. While the approach is tailored to the monotonic nature of TTS input-output alignment, it is still able to benefit from the flexible modeling power of interleaved multi-head self- and cross-attention operations. A system incorporating these improvements, which we call Very Attentive Tacotron, matches the naturalness and expressiveness of a baseline T5-based TTS system, while eliminating problems with repeated or dropped words and enabling generalization to any practical utterance length.</description>

      <title>Natural Language Processing for Analyzing Electronic Health Records and Clinical Notes in Cancer Research: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: This review aims to analyze the application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques in cancer research using electronic health records (EHRs) and clinical notes. This review addresses gaps in the existing literature by providing a broader perspective than previous studies focused on specific cancer types or applications. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the Scopus database, identifying 94 relevant studies published between 2019 and 2024. Data extraction included study characteristics, cancer types, NLP methodologies, dataset information, performance metrics, challenges, and future directions. Studies were categorized based on cancer types and NLP applications. Results: The results showed a growing trend in NLP applications for cancer research, with breast, lung, and colorectal cancers being the most studied. Information extraction and text classification emerged as predominant NLP tasks. A shift from rule-based to advanced machine learning techniques, particularly transformer-based models, was observed. The Dataset sizes used in existing studies varied widely. Key challenges included the limited generalizability of proposed solutions and the need for improved integration into clinical workflows. Conclusion: NLP techniques show significant potential in analyzing EHRs and clinical notes for cancer research. However, future work should focus on improving model generalizability, enhancing robustness in handling complex clinical language, and expanding applications to understudied cancer types. Integration of NLP tools into clinical practice and addressing ethical considerations remain crucial for utilizing the full potential of NLP in enhancing cancer diagnosis, treatment, and patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Class-Aware Contrastive Optimization for Imbalanced Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unique characteristics of text data make classification tasks a complex problem. Advances in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning and autoencoder architectures addressed several challenges. However, they still struggle with imbalanced text classification tasks, a common scenario in real-world applications, demonstrating a tendency to produce embeddings with unfavorable properties, such as class overlap. In this paper, we show that leveraging class-aware contrastive optimization combined with denoising autoencoders can successfully tackle imbalanced text classification tasks, achieving better performance than the current state-of-the-art. Concretely, our proposal combines reconstruction loss with contrastive class separation in the embedding space, allowing a better balance between the truthfulness of the generated embeddings and the model's ability to separate different classes. Compared with an extensive set of traditional and state-of-the-art competing methods, our proposal demonstrates a notable increase in performance across a wide variety of text datasets.</description>

      <title>ProMQA: Question Answering Dataset for Multimodal Procedural Activity Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal systems have great potential to assist humans in procedural activities, where people follow instructions to achieve their goals. Despite diverse application scenarios, systems are typically evaluated on traditional classification tasks, e.g., action recognition or temporal action segmentation. In this paper, we present a novel evaluation dataset, ProMQA, to measure system advancements in application-oriented scenarios. ProMQA consists of 401 multimodal procedural QA pairs on user recording of procedural activities coupled with their corresponding instruction. For QA annotation, we take a cost-effective human-LLM collaborative approach, where the existing annotation is augmented with LLM-generated QA pairs that are later verified by humans. We then provide the benchmark results to set the baseline performance on ProMQA. Our experiment reveals a significant gap between human performance and that of current systems, including competitive proprietary multimodal models. We hope our dataset sheds light on new aspects of models' multimodal understanding capabilities.</description>

      <title>DISCERN: Decoding Systematic Errors in Natural Language for Text Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their high predictive accuracies, current machine learning systems often exhibit systematic biases stemming from annotation artifacts or insufficient support for certain classes in the dataset. Recent work proposes automatic methods for identifying and explaining systematic biases using keywords. We introduce DISCERN, a framework for interpreting systematic biases in text classifiers using language explanations. DISCERN iteratively generates precise natural language descriptions of systematic errors by employing an interactive loop between two large language models. Finally, we use the descriptions to improve classifiers by augmenting classifier training sets with synthetically generated instances or annotated examples via active learning. On three text-classification datasets, we demonstrate that language explanations from our framework induce consistent performance improvements that go beyond what is achievable with exemplars of systematic bias. Finally, in human evaluations, we show that users can interpret systematic biases more effectively (by over 25% relative) and efficiently when described through language explanations as opposed to cluster exemplars.</description>

      <title>FactBench: A Dynamic Benchmark for In-the-Wild Language Model Factuality Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) are widely used by an increasing number of users, underscoring the challenge of maintaining factuality across a broad range of topics. We first present VERIFY (Verification and Evidence RetrIeval for FactualitY evaluation), a pipeline to evaluate LMs' factuality in real-world user interactions. VERIFY considers the verifiability of LM-generated content and categorizes content units as supported, unsupported, or undecidable based on the retrieved evidence from the Web. Importantly, factuality judgment by VERIFY correlates better with human evaluations than existing methods. Using VERIFY, we identify "hallucination prompts" across diverse topics, i.e., those eliciting the highest rates of incorrect and inconclusive LM responses. These prompts form FactBench, a dataset of 1K prompts across 150 fine-grained topics. Our dataset captures emerging factuality challenges in real-world LM interactions and can be regularly updated with new prompts. We benchmark widely-used LMs from GPT, Gemini, and Llama3.1 family on FactBench, yielding the following key findings: (i) Proprietary models exhibit better factuality, with performance declining from Easy to Hard hallucination prompts. (ii) Llama3.1-405B-Instruct shows comparable or lower factual accuracy than Llama3.1-70B-Instruct across all evaluation methods due to its higher subjectivity that leads to more content labeled as undecidable. (iii) Gemini1.5-Pro shows a significantly higher refusal rate, with over-refusal in 25% of cases. Our code and data are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/launch/factbench.</description>

      <title>From melodic note sequences to pitches using word2vec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying the word2vec technique, commonly used in language modeling, to melodies, where notes are treated as words in sentences, enables the capture of pitch information. This study examines two datasets: 20 children's songs and an excerpt from a Bach sonata. The semantic space for defining the embeddings is of very small dimension, specifically 2. Notes are predicted based on the 2, 3 or 4 preceding notes that establish the context. A multivariate analysis of the results shows that the semantic vectors representing the notes have a multiple correlation coefficient of approximately 0.80 with their pitches.</description>

      <title>Flow-DPO: Improving LLM Mathematical Reasoning through Online Multi-Agent Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a crucial capability for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet generating detailed and accurate reasoning traces remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel approach to produce high-quality reasoning traces for LLM fine-tuning using online learning \textbf{Flows}. Our method employs an incremental output production Flow, where component LLMs collaboratively construct solutions through iterative communication. We train the Flow using online Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) learning with rollouts, generating DPO pairs for each training example and updating models in real-time. We directly compare the quality of reasoning traces generated by our method with those produced through direct model inference, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in improving LLM performance in mathematical reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Natural Language Inference Improves Compositionality in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compositional reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remains challenging as these models often struggle to relate objects, attributes, and spatial relationships. Recent methods aim to address these limitations by relying on the semantics of the textual description, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to break them down into subsets of questions and answers. However, these methods primarily operate on the surface level, failing to incorporate deeper lexical understanding while introducing incorrect assumptions generated by the LLM. In response to these issues, we present Caption Expansion with Contradictions and Entailments (CECE), a principled approach that leverages Natural Language Inference (NLI) to generate entailments and contradictions from a given premise. CECE produces lexically diverse sentences while maintaining their core meaning. Through extensive experiments, we show that CECE enhances interpretability and reduces overreliance on biased or superficial features. By balancing CECE along the original premise, we achieve significant improvements over previous methods without requiring additional fine-tuning, producing state-of-the-art results on benchmarks that score agreement with human judgments for image-text alignment, and achieving an increase in performance on Winoground of +19.2% (group score) and +12.9% on EqBen (group score) over the best prior work (finetuned with targeted data).</description>

      <title>Understanding Synthetic Context Extension via Retrieval Heads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-context LLMs are increasingly in demand for applications such as retrieval-augmented generation. To defray the cost of pretraining LLMs over long contexts, recent work takes an approach of synthetic context extension: fine-tuning LLMs with synthetically generated long-context data in a post-training stage. However, it remains unclear how and why this synthetic context extension imparts abilities for downstream long-context tasks. In this paper, we investigate fine-tuning on synthetic data for three long-context tasks that require retrieval and reasoning. We vary the realism of "needle" concepts to be retrieved and diversity of the surrounding "haystack" context, from using LLMs to construct synthetic documents to using templated relations and creating symbolic datasets. We find that models trained on synthetic data fall short of the real data, but surprisingly, the mismatch can be interpreted and even predicted in terms of a special set of attention heads that are responsible for retrieval over long context: retrieval heads (Wu et al., 2024). The retrieval heads learned on synthetic data are mostly subsets of the retrieval heads learned on real data, and there is a strong correlation between the recall of heads learned and the downstream performance of a model. Furthermore, with attention knockout and activation patching, we mechanistically show that retrieval heads are necessary and explain model performance, although they are not totally sufficient. Our results shed light on how to interpret synthetic data fine-tuning performance and how to approach creating better data for learning real-world capabilities over long contexts.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{PatentAgent}$: Intelligent Agent for Automated Pharmaceutical Patent Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pharmaceutical patents play a vital role in biochemical industries, especially in drug discovery, providing researchers with unique early access to data, experimental results, and research insights. With the advancement of machine learning, patent analysis has evolved from manual labor to tasks assisted by automatic tools. However, there still lacks an unified agent that assists every aspect of patent analysis, from patent reading to core chemical identification. Leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand requests and follow instructions, we introduce the $\textbf{first}$ intelligent agent in this domain, $\texttt{PatentAgent}$, poised to advance and potentially revolutionize the landscape of pharmaceutical research. $\texttt{PatentAgent}$ comprises three key end-to-end modules -- $\textit{PA-QA}$, $\textit{PA-Img2Mol}$, and $\textit{PA-CoreId}$ -- that respectively perform (1) patent question-answering, (2) image-to-molecular-structure conversion, and (3) core chemical structure identification, addressing the essential needs of scientists and practitioners in pharmaceutical patent analysis. Each module of $\texttt{PatentAgent}$ demonstrates significant effectiveness with the updated algorithm and the synergistic design of $\texttt{PatentAgent}$ framework. $\textit{PA-Img2Mol}$ outperforms existing methods across CLEF, JPO, UOB, and USPTO patent benchmarks with an accuracy gain between 2.46% and 8.37% while $\textit{PA-CoreId}$ realizes accuracy improvement ranging from 7.15% to 7.62% on PatentNetML benchmark. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Material discovery is a critical research area with profound implications for various industries. In this work, we introduce MatExpert, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and contrastive learning to accelerate the discovery and design of new solid-state materials. Inspired by the workflow of human materials design experts, our approach integrates three key stages: retrieval, transition, and generation. First, in the retrieval stage, MatExpert identifies an existing material that closely matches the desired criteria. Second, in the transition stage, MatExpert outlines the necessary modifications to transform this material formulation to meet specific requirements outlined by the initial user query. Third, in the generation state, MatExpert performs detailed computations and structural generation to create new materials based on the provided information. Our experimental results demonstrate that MatExpert outperforms state-of-the-art methods in material generation tasks, achieving superior performance across various metrics including validity, distribution, and stability. As such, MatExpert represents a meaningful advancement in computational material discovery using langauge-based generative models.</description>

      <title>User-Aware Multilingual Abusive Content Detection in Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite growing efforts to halt distasteful content on social media, multilingualism has added a new dimension to this problem. The scarcity of resources makes the challenge even greater when it comes to low-resource languages. This work focuses on providing a novel method for abusive content detection in multiple low-resource Indic languages. Our observation indicates that a post's tendency to attract abusive comments, as well as features such as user history and social context, significantly aid in the detection of abusive content. The proposed method first learns social and text context features in two separate modules. The integrated representation from these modules is learned and used for the final prediction. To evaluate the performance of our method against different classical and state-of-the-art methods, we have performed extensive experiments on SCIDN and MACI datasets consisting of 1.5M and 665K multilingual comments, respectively. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods with an average increase of 4.08% and 9.52% in F1-scores on SCIDN and MACI datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Building, Reusing, and Generalizing Abstract Representations from Concrete Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans excel at learning abstract patterns across different sequences, filtering out irrelevant details, and transferring these generalized concepts to new sequences. In contrast, many sequence learning models lack the ability to abstract, which leads to memory inefficiency and poor transfer. We introduce a non-parametric hierarchical variable learning model (HVM) that learns chunks from sequences and abstracts contextually similar chunks as variables. HVM efficiently organizes memory while uncovering abstractions, leading to compact sequence representations. When learning on language datasets such as babyLM, HVM learns a more efficient dictionary than standard compression algorithms such as Lempel-Ziv. In a sequence recall task requiring the acquisition and transfer of variables embedded in sequences, we demonstrate HVM's sequence likelihood correlates with human recall times. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) struggle to transfer abstract variables as effectively as humans. From HVM's adjustable layer of abstraction, we demonstrate that the model realizes a precise trade-off between compression and generalization. Our work offers a cognitive model that captures the learning and transfer of abstract representations in human cognition and differentiates itself from the behavior of large language models.</description>

      <title>Mind Your Step (by Step): Chain-of-Thought can Reduce Performance on Tasks where Thinking Makes Humans Worse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has become a widely used strategy for working with large language and multimodal models. While CoT has been shown to improve performance across many tasks, determining the settings in which it is effective remains an ongoing effort. In particular, it is still an open question in what settings CoT systematically reduces model performance. In this paper, we seek to identify the characteristics of tasks where CoT reduces performance by drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, looking at cases where (i) verbal thinking or deliberation hurts performance in humans, and (ii) the constraints governing human performance generalize to language models. Three such cases are implicit statistical learning, visual recognition, and classifying with patterns containing exceptions. In extensive experiments across all three settings, we find that a diverse collection of state-of-the-art models exhibit significant drop-offs in performance (e.g., up to 36.3% absolute accuracy for OpenAI o1-preview compared to GPT-4o) when using inference-time reasoning compared to zero-shot counterparts. We also identify three tasks that satisfy condition (i) but not (ii), and find that while verbal thinking reduces human performance in these tasks, CoT retains or increases model performance. Overall, our results show that while there is not an exact parallel between the cognitive processes of models and those of humans, considering cases where thinking has negative consequences for human performance can help us identify settings where it negatively impacts models. By connecting the literature on human deliberation with evaluations of CoT, we offer a new tool that can be used in understanding the impact of prompt choices and inference-time reasoning.</description>

      <title>ShadowKV: KV Cache in Shadows for High-Throughput Long-Context LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the widespread deployment of long-context large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing demand for efficient support of high-throughput inference. However, as the key-value (KV) cache expands with the sequence length, the increasing memory footprint and the need to access it for each token generation both result in low throughput when serving long-context LLMs. While various dynamic sparse attention methods have been proposed to speed up inference while maintaining generation quality, they either fail to sufficiently reduce GPU memory consumption or introduce significant decoding latency by offloading the KV cache to the CPU. We present ShadowKV, a high-throughput long-context LLM inference system that stores the low-rank key cache and offloads the value cache to reduce the memory footprint for larger batch sizes and longer sequences. To minimize decoding latency, ShadowKV employs an accurate KV selection strategy that reconstructs minimal sparse KV pairs on-the-fly. By evaluating ShadowKV on a broad range of benchmarks, including RULER, LongBench, and Needle In A Haystack, and models like Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3-8B-1M, GLM-4-9B-1M, Yi-9B-200K, Phi-3-Mini-128K, and Qwen2-7B-128K, we demonstrate that it can support up to 6$\times$ larger batch sizes and boost throughput by up to 3.04$\times$ on an A100 GPU without sacrificing accuracy, even surpassing the performance achievable with infinite batch size under the assumption of infinite GPU memory. The code is available at https://github.com/bytedance/ShadowKV.</description>

      <title>AiSciVision: A Framework for Specializing Large Multimodal Models in Scientific Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trust and interpretability are crucial for the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in scientific research, but current models often operate as black boxes offering limited transparency and justifications for their outputs. We introduce AiSciVision, a framework that specializes Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) into interactive research partners and classification models for image classification tasks in niche scientific domains. Our framework uses two key components: (1) Visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (VisRAG) and (2) domain-specific tools utilized in an agentic workflow. To classify a target image, AiSciVision first retrieves the most similar positive and negative labeled images as context for the LMM. Then the LMM agent actively selects and applies tools to manipulate and inspect the target image over multiple rounds, refining its analysis before making a final prediction. These VisRAG and tooling components are designed to mirror the processes of domain experts, as humans often compare new data to similar examples and use specialized tools to manipulate and inspect images before arriving at a conclusion. Each inference produces both a prediction and a natural language transcript detailing the reasoning and tool usage that led to the prediction. We evaluate AiSciVision on three real-world scientific image classification datasets: detecting the presence of aquaculture ponds, diseased eelgrass, and solar panels. Across these datasets, our method outperforms fully supervised models in low and full-labeled data settings. AiSciVision is actively deployed in real-world use, specifically for aquaculture research, through a dedicated web application that displays and allows the expert users to converse with the transcripts. This work represents a crucial step toward AI systems that are both interpretable and effective, advancing their use in scientific research and scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>FATH: Authentication-based Test-time Defense against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed as the backbone with additional tools and text information for real-world applications. However, integrating external information into LLM-integrated applications raises significant security concerns. Among these, prompt injection attacks are particularly threatening, where malicious instructions injected in the external text information can exploit LLMs to generate answers as the attackers desire. While both training-time and test-time defense methods have been developed to mitigate such attacks, the unaffordable training costs associated with training-time methods and the limited effectiveness of existing test-time methods make them impractical. This paper introduces a novel test-time defense strategy, named Formatting AuThentication with Hash-based tags (FATH). Unlike existing approaches that prevent LLMs from answering additional instructions in external text, our method implements an authentication system, requiring LLMs to answer all received instructions with a security policy and selectively filter out responses to user instructions as the final output. To achieve this, we utilize hash-based authentication tags to label each response, facilitating accurate identification of responses according to the user's instructions and improving the robustness against adaptive attacks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our defense method can effectively defend against indirect prompt injection attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance under Llama3 and GPT3.5 models across various attack methods.

      <title>LLM-Forest for Health Tabular Data Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Missing data imputation is a critical challenge in tabular datasets, especially in healthcare, where data completeness is vital for accurate analysis. Large language models (LLMs), trained on vast corpora, have shown strong potential in data generation, making them a promising tool for tabular data imputation. However, challenges persist in designing effective prompts for a finetuning-free process and in mitigating the risk of LLM hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, LLM-Forest, which introduces a "forest" of few-shot learning LLM "trees" with confidence-based weighted voting. This framework is established on a new concept of bipartite information graphs to identify high-quality relevant neighboring entries with both feature and value granularity. Extensive experiments on four real-world healthcare datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LLM-Forest.</description>

      <title>Not All LLM-Generated Data Are Equal: Rethinking Data Weighting in Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data augmentation via large language models (LLMs) allows researchers to leverage additional training data, thus enhancing the performance of downstream tasks, especially when real-world data is scarce. However, the generated data can deviate from the real-world data, and this misalignment can bring deficient outcomes while applying the trained model to applications. Therefore, we proposed efficient weighted-loss approaches to align synthetic data with real-world distribution by emphasizing high-quality and diversified data generated by LLMs with using merely a little real-world data. We empirically assessed the effectiveness of our method on multiple text classification tasks, and the results showed leveraging our approaches on a BERT-level model robustly outperformed standard cross-entropy and other data weighting approaches, providing potential solutions to effectively leveraging synthetic data from any suitable data generator for model training.</description>

      <title>L3Ms -- Lagrange Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and alignment of large language models (LLMs) are key steps in providing a good user experience. However, the concept of an appropriate alignment is inherently application-dependent, and current methods often rely on heuristic choices to drive the optimization. In this work, we formulate SFT and alignment as a constrained optimization problem, where the LLM is trained on a task while being required to meet application-specific requirements, without resorting to heuristics. To solve this, we propose Lagrange Large Language Models (L3Ms), which employ logarithmic barriers to enforce the constraints. This approach allows for the customization of L3Ms across diverse applications while avoiding heuristic-driven processes. We demonstrate experimentally the versatility and efficacy of L3Ms in achieving tailored alignments for various applications.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel method for evaluating the performance of a content search system that measures the semantic match between a query and the results returned by the search system. We introduce a metric called "on-topic rate" to measure the percentage of results that are relevant to the query. To achieve this, we design a pipeline that defines a golden query set, retrieves the top K results for each query, and sends calls to GPT 3.5 with formulated prompts. Our semantic evaluation pipeline helps identify common failure patterns and goals against the metric for relevance improvements.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Replace Data Scientists in Clinical Research?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data science plays a critical role in clinical research, but it requires professionals with expertise in coding and medical data analysis. Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in supporting medical tasks and performing well in general coding tests. However, these tests do not assess LLMs' ability to handle data science tasks in medicine, nor do they explore their practical utility in clinical research. To address this, we developed a dataset consisting of 293 real-world data science coding tasks, based on 39 published clinical studies, covering 128 tasks in Python and 165 tasks in R. This dataset simulates realistic clinical research scenarios using patient data. Our findings reveal that cutting-edge LLMs struggle to generate perfect solutions, frequently failing to follow input instructions, understand target data, and adhere to standard analysis practices. Consequently, LLMs are not yet ready to fully automate data science tasks. We benchmarked advanced adaptation methods and found two to be particularly effective: chain-of-thought prompting, which provides a step-by-step plan for data analysis, which led to a 60% improvement in code accuracy; and self-reflection, enabling LLMs to iteratively refine their code, yielding a 38% accuracy improvement. Building on these insights, we developed a platform that integrates LLMs into the data science workflow for medical professionals. In a user study with five medical doctors, we found that while LLMs cannot fully automate coding tasks, they significantly streamline the programming process. We found that 80% of their submitted code solutions were incorporated from LLM-generated code, with up to 96% reuse in some cases. Our analysis highlights the potential of LLMs, when integrated into expert workflows, to enhance data science efficiency in clinical research.</description>

      <title>Can Language Models Replace Programmers? REPOCOD Says 'Not Yet'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in code generation with more than 90 pass@1 in solving Python coding problems in HumanEval and MBPP. Such high accuracy leads to the question: can LLMs replace human programmers? Existing manual crafted, simple, or single-line code generation benchmarks cannot answer this question due to their gap with real-world software development. To answer this question, we propose REPOCOD, a code generation benchmark with 980 problems collected from 11 popular real-world projects, with more than 58% of them requiring file-level or repository-level context information. In addition, REPOCOD has the longest average canonical solution length (331.6 tokens) and the highest average cyclomatic complexity (9.00) compared to existing benchmarks. In our evaluations on ten LLMs, none of the models can achieve more than 30 pass@1 on REPOCOD, disclosing the necessity of building stronger LLMs that can help developers in real-world software development.</description>

      <title>Sequential choice in ordered bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experience goods such as sporting and artistic events, songs, videos, news stories, podcasts, and television series, are often packaged and consumed in bundles. Many such bundles are ordered in the sense that the individual items are consumed sequentially, one at a time. We examine if an individual's decision to consume the next item in an ordered bundle can be predicted based on his/her consumption pattern for the preceding items. We evaluate several predictive models, including two custom Transformers using decoder-only and encoder-decoder architectures, fine-tuned GPT-3, a custom LSTM model, a reinforcement learning model, two Markov models, and a zero-order model. Using data from Spotify, we find that the custom Transformer with a decoder-only architecture provides the most accurate predictions, both for individual choices and aggregate demand. This model captures a general form of state dependence. Analysis of Transformer attention weights suggests that the consumption of the next item in a bundle is based on approximately equal weighting of all preceding choices. Our results indicate that the Transformer can assist in queuing the next item that an individual is likely to consume from an ordered bundle, predicting the demand for individual items, and personalizing promotions to increase demand.</description>

      <title>MARCO: Multi-Agent Real-time Chat Orchestration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model advancements have enabled the development of multi-agent frameworks to tackle complex, real-world problems such as to automate tasks that require interactions with diverse tools, reasoning, and human collaboration. We present MARCO, a Multi-Agent Real-time Chat Orchestration framework for automating tasks using LLMs. MARCO addresses key challenges in utilizing LLMs for complex, multi-step task execution. It incorporates robust guardrails to steer LLM behavior, validate outputs, and recover from errors that stem from inconsistent output formatting, function and parameter hallucination, and lack of domain knowledge. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate MARCO's superior performance with 94.48% and 92.74% accuracy on task execution for Digital Restaurant Service Platform conversations and Retail conversations datasets respectively along with 44.91% improved latency and 33.71% cost reduction. We also report effects of guardrails in performance gain along with comparisons of various LLM models, both open-source and proprietary. The modular and generic design of MARCO allows it to be adapted for automating tasks across domains and to execute complex usecases through multi-turn interactions.</description>

      <title>Gnothi Seauton: Empowering Faithful Self-Interpretability in Black-Box Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The debate between self-interpretable models and post-hoc explanations for black-box models is central to Explainable AI (XAI). Self-interpretable models, such as concept-based networks, offer insights by connecting decisions to human-understandable concepts but often struggle with performance and scalability. Conversely, post-hoc methods like Shapley values, while theoretically robust, are computationally expensive and resource-intensive. To bridge the gap between these two lines of research, we propose a novel method that combines their strengths, providing theoretically guaranteed self-interpretability for black-box models without compromising prediction accuracy. Specifically, we introduce a parameter-efficient pipeline, *AutoGnothi*, which integrates a small side network into the black-box model, allowing it to generate Shapley value explanations without changing the original network parameters. This side-tuning approach significantly reduces memory, training, and inference costs, outperforming traditional parameter-efficient methods, where full fine-tuning serves as the optimal baseline. *AutoGnothi* enables the black-box model to predict and explain its predictions with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments show that *AutoGnothi* offers accurate explanations for both vision and language tasks, delivering superior computational efficiency with comparable interpretability.</description>

      <title>Evaluating K-Fold Cross Validation for Transformer Based Symbolic Regression Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression remains an NP-Hard problem, with extensive research focusing on AI models for this task. Transformer models have shown promise in Symbolic Regression, but performance suffers with smaller datasets. We propose applying k-fold cross-validation to a transformer-based symbolic regression model trained on a significantly reduced dataset (15,000 data points, down from 500,000). This technique partitions the training data into multiple subsets (folds), iteratively training on some while validating on others. Our aim is to provide an estimate of model generalization and mitigate overfitting issues associated with smaller datasets. Results show that this process improves the model's output consistency and generalization by a relative improvement in validation loss of 53.31%. Potentially enabling more efficient and accessible symbolic regression in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>A Longitudinal Analysis of Racial and Gender Bias in New York Times and Fox News Images and Articles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The manner in which different racial and gender groups are portrayed in news coverage plays a large role in shaping public opinion. As such, understanding how such groups are portrayed in news media is of notable societal value, and has thus been a significant endeavour in both the computer and social sciences. Yet, the literature still lacks a longitudinal study examining both the frequency of appearance of different racial and gender groups in online news articles, as well as the context in which such groups are discussed. To fill this gap, we propose two machine learning classifiers to detect the race and age of a given subject. Next, we compile a dataset of 123,337 images and 441,321 online news articles from New York Times (NYT) and Fox News (Fox), and examine representation through two computational approaches. Firstly, we examine the frequency and prominence of appearance of racial and gender groups in images embedded in news articles, revealing that racial and gender minorities are largely under-represented, and when they do appear, they are featured less prominently compared to majority groups. Furthermore, we find that NYT largely features more images of racial minority groups compared to Fox. Secondly, we examine both the frequency and context with which racial minority groups are presented in article text. This reveals the narrow scope in which certain racial groups are covered and the frequency with which different groups are presented as victims and/or perpetrators in a given conflict. Taken together, our analysis contributes to the literature by providing two novel open-source classifiers to detect race and age from images, and shedding light on the racial and gender biases in news articles from venues on opposite ends of the American political spectrum.</description>

      <title>An Actor-Critic Approach to Boosting Text-to-SQL Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-To-SQL (T2S) conversion based on large language models (LLMs) has found a wide range of applications, by leveraging the capabilities of LLMs in interpreting the query intent expressed in natural language. Existing research focuses on suitable representations for data schema and/or questions, task-specific instructions and representative examples, and complicated inference pipelines. All these methods are empirical and task specific, without a theoretical bound on performance. In this paper, we propose a simple, general, and performance guaranteed T2S enhancement approach called Actor-Critic (AC). Specifically, we design two roles using the same LLM: an Actor to produce SQL queries and a Critic to evaluate the produced SQL. If the Critic believes the produced SQL is wrong, it notifies the Actor to reproduce the SQL and perform evaluation again. By this simple iterative process, expected performance can be derived in theory. We conducted extensive experiments on the Spider and related datasets with eleven LLMs, and demonstrated that the Actor-Critic method consistently improves the performance of T2S, thus serving as a general enhancement approach for T2S conversion.</description>

      <title>Unlearning as multi-task optimization: A normalized gradient difference approach with an adaptive learning rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning has been used to remove unwanted knowledge acquired by large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we examine machine unlearning from an optimization perspective, framing it as a regularized multi-task optimization problem, where one task optimizes a forgetting objective and another optimizes the model performance. In particular, we introduce a normalized gradient difference (NGDiff) algorithm, enabling us to have better control over the trade-off between the objectives, while integrating a new, automatic learning rate scheduler. We provide a theoretical analysis and empirically demonstrate the superior performance of NGDiff among state-of-the-art unlearning methods on the TOFU and MUSE datasets while exhibiting stable training.</description>

      <title>RankUp: Boosting Semi-Supervised Regression with an Auxiliary Ranking Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) semi-supervised learning techniques, such as FixMatch and it's variants, have demonstrated impressive performance in classification tasks. However, these methods are not directly applicable to regression tasks. In this paper, we present RankUp, a simple yet effective approach that adapts existing semi-supervised classification techniques to enhance the performance of regression tasks. RankUp achieves this by converting the original regression task into a ranking problem and training it concurrently with the original regression objective. This auxiliary ranking classifier outputs a classification result, thus enabling integration with existing semi-supervised classification methods. Moreover, we introduce regression distribution alignment (RDA), a complementary technique that further enhances RankUp's performance by refining pseudo-labels through distribution alignment. Despite its simplicity, RankUp, with or without RDA, achieves SOTA results in across a range of regression benchmarks, including computer vision, audio, and natural language processing tasks.

      <title>ADAM: An Embodied Causal Agent in Open-World Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In open-world environments like Minecraft, existing agents face challenges in continuously learning structured knowledge, particularly causality. These challenges stem from the opacity inherent in black-box models and an excessive reliance on prior knowledge during training, which impair their interpretability and generalization capability. To this end, we introduce ADAM, An emboDied causal Agent in Minecraft, that can autonomously navigate the open world, perceive multimodal contexts, learn causal world knowledge, and tackle complex tasks through lifelong learning. ADAM is empowered by four key components: 1) an interaction module, enabling the agent to execute actions while documenting the interaction processes; 2) a causal model module, tasked with constructing an ever-growing causal graph from scratch, which enhances interpretability and diminishes reliance on prior knowledge; 3) a controller module, comprising a planner, an actor, and a memory pool, which uses the learned causal graph to accomplish tasks; 4) a perception module, powered by multimodal large language models, which enables ADAM to perceive like a human player. Extensive experiments show that ADAM constructs an almost perfect causal graph from scratch, enabling efficient task decomposition and execution with strong interpretability. Notably, in our modified Minecraft games where no prior knowledge is available, ADAM maintains its performance and shows remarkable robustness and generalization capability. ADAM pioneers a novel paradigm that integrates causal methods and embodied agents in a synergistic manner. Our project page is at https://opencausalab.github.io/ADAM.</description>

      <title>Cora: Accelerating Stateful Network Applications with SmartNICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing performance requirements on networked applications, there is a new trend of offloading stateful network applications to SmartNICs to improve performance and reduce the total cost of ownership. However, offloading stateful network applications is non-trivial due to state operation complexity, state resource consumption, and the complicated relationship between traffic and state. Naively partitioning the program by state or traffic can result in a suboptimal partition plan with higher CPU usage or even packet drops. In this paper, we propose Cora, a compiler and runtime that offloads stateful network applications to SmartNIC-accelerated hosts. Cora compiler introduces an accurate performance model for each SmartNIC and employs an efficient compiling algorithm to search the offloading plan. Cora runtime can monitor traffic dynamics and adapt to minimize CPU usage. Cora is built atop Netronome Agilio and BlueField 2 SmartNICs. Our evaluation shows that for the same throughput target, Cora can propose partition plans saving up to 94.0% CPU cores, 1.9 times more than baseline solutions. Under the same resource constraint, Cora can accelerate network functions by 44.9%-82.3%. Cora runtime can adapt to traffic changes and keep CPU usage low.</description>

      <title>Fourier Head: Helping Large Language Models Learn Complex Probability Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the quality of large language models has improved, there has been increased interest in using them to model non-linguistic tokens. For example, the Decision Transformer recasts agentic decision making as a sequence modeling problem, using a decoder-only LLM to model the distribution over the discrete action space for an Atari agent. However, when adapting LLMs to non-linguistic domains, it remains unclear if softmax over discrete bins captures the continuous structure of the tokens and the potentially complex distributions needed for high quality token generation. We introduce a neural network layer, constructed using Fourier series, which we can easily substitute for any linear layer if we want the outputs to have a more continuous structure. We perform extensive analysis on synthetic datasets, as well as on large-scale decision making and time series forecasting tasks. We also provide theoretical evidence that this layer can better learn signal from data while ignoring high-frequency noise. All of our results support the effectiveness of our proposed Fourier head in scenarios where the underlying data distribution has a natural continuous structure. For example, the Fourier head improves a Decision Transformer agent's returns by 46% on the Atari Seaquest game, and increases a state-of-the-art times series foundation model's forecasting performance by 3.5% across 20 benchmarks unseen during training.</description>

      <title>SVIP: Towards Verifiable Inference of Open-source Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, leading to widespread adoption across various domains. However, their increasing model sizes render local deployment impractical for individual users, pushing many to rely on computing service providers for inference through a blackbox API. This reliance introduces a new risk: a computing provider may stealthily substitute the requested LLM with a smaller, less capable model without consent from users, thereby delivering inferior outputs while benefiting from cost savings. In this paper, we formalize the problem of verifiable inference for LLMs. Existing verifiable computing solutions based on cryptographic or game-theoretic techniques are either computationally uneconomical or rest on strong assumptions. We introduce SVIP, a secret-based verifiable LLM inference protocol that leverages intermediate outputs from LLM as unique model identifiers. By training a proxy task on these outputs and requiring the computing provider to return both the generated text and the processed intermediate outputs, users can reliably verify whether the computing provider is acting honestly. In addition, the integration of a secret mechanism further enhances the security of our protocol. We thoroughly analyze our protocol under multiple strong and adaptive adversarial scenarios. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SVIP is accurate, generalizable, computationally efficient, and resistant to various attacks. Notably, SVIP achieves false negative rates below 5% and false positive rates below 3%, while requiring less than 0.01 seconds per query for verification.</description>

      <title>Task Vectors are Cross-Modal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the internal representations of vision-and-language models (VLMs) and how they encode task representations. We consider tasks specified through examples or instructions, using either text or image inputs. Surprisingly, we find that conceptually similar tasks are mapped to similar task vector representations, regardless of how they are specified. Our findings suggest that to output answers, tokens in VLMs undergo three distinct phases: input, task, and answer, a process which is consistent across different modalities and specifications. The task vectors we identify in VLMs are general enough to be derived in one modality (e.g., text) and transferred to another (e.g., image). Additionally, we find that ensembling exemplar and instruction based task vectors produce better task representations. Taken together, these insights shed light on the underlying mechanisms of VLMs, particularly their ability to represent tasks in a shared manner across different modalities and task specifications.

      <description>arXiv:2310.10583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Both standalone language models (LMs) as well as LMs within downstream-task systems have been shown to generate statements which are factually untrue. This problem is especially severe for low-resource languages, where training data is scarce and of worse quality than for high-resource languages. In this opinion piece, we argue that LMs in their current state will never be fully trustworthy in critical settings and suggest a possible novel strategy to handle this issue: by building LMs such that can cite their sources - i.e., point a user to the parts of their training data that back up their outputs. We first discuss which current NLP tasks would or would not benefit from such models. We then highlight the expected benefits such models would bring, e.g., quick verifiability of statements. We end by outlining the individual tasks that would need to be solved on the way to developing LMs with the ability to cite. We hope to start a discussion about the field's current approach to building LMs, especially for low-resource languages, and the role of the training data in explaining model generations.</description>

      <title>End-to-end Joint Punctuated and Normalized ASR with a Limited Amount of Punctuated Training Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Joint punctuated and normalized automatic speech recognition (ASR), that outputs transcripts with and without punctuation and casing, remains challenging due to the lack of paired speech and punctuated text data in most ASR corpora. We propose two approaches to train an end-to-end joint punctuated and normalized ASR system using limited punctuated data. The first approach uses a language model to convert normalized training transcripts into punctuated transcripts. This achieves a better performance on out-of-domain test data, with up to 17% relative Punctuation-Case-aware Word Error Rate (PC-WER) reduction. The second approach uses a single decoder conditioned on the type of output. This yields a 42% relative PC-WER reduction compared to Whisper-base and a 4% relative (normalized) WER reduction compared to the normalized output of a punctuated-only model. Additionally, our proposed modeldemonstrates the feasibility of a joint ASR system using as little as 5% punctuated training data with a moderate (2.42% absolute) PC-WER increase.</description>

      <title>ASVD: Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition for Compressing Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05821v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new post-training compression paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate their wider adoption. We delve into LLM weight low-rank decomposition, and find that the challenges of this task stem from the distribution variance in the LLM activations and the sensitivity difference among various kinds of layers. To address these issues, we propose a training-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition (ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by transforming the weight matrix based on the activation distribution. This transformation allows the outliers in the activation matrix to be absorbed into the transformed weight matrix, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy. Additionally, we propose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize layer-specific decomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different LLM layers. In this way, ASVD can compress a network by 10%-30%. Based on the success of the low-rank decomposition of projection matrices in the self-attention module, we further introduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By reducing the channel dimension of KV activations, memory requirements for KV cache can be largely reduced. ASVD can further achieve 50% KV cache reductions without performance drop in a training-free manner. Code is anonymously available in supplementary materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-quality, large-scale corpora are the cornerstone of building foundation models. In this work, we introduce MathPile, a diverse and high-quality math-centric corpus comprising about 9.5 billion tokens. Throughout its creation, we adhered to the principle of "less is more", firmly believing in the supremacy of data quality over quantity, even in the pre-training phase. Our meticulous data collection and processing efforts included a complex suite of preprocessing, prefiltering, language identification, cleaning, filtering, and deduplication, ensuring the high quality of our corpus. Furthermore, we performed data contamination detection on downstream benchmark test sets to eliminate duplicates and conducted continual pre-training experiments, booting the performance on common mathematical reasoning benchmarks. We aim for our MathPile to boost language models' mathematical reasoning abilities and open-source its different versions and processing scripts to advance the field.</description>

      <title>Proximal Causal Inference With Text Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent text-based causal methods attempt to mitigate confounding bias by estimating proxies of confounding variables that are partially or imperfectly measured from unstructured text data. These approaches, however, assume analysts have supervised labels of the confounders given text for a subset of instances, a constraint that is sometimes infeasible due to data privacy or annotation costs. In this work, we address settings in which an important confounding variable is completely unobserved. We propose a new causal inference method that uses two instances of pre-treatment text data, infers two proxies using two zero-shot models on the separate instances, and applies these proxies in the proximal g-formula. We prove, under certain assumptions about the instances of text and accuracy of the zero-shot predictions, that our method of inferring text-based proxies satisfies identification conditions of the proximal g-formula while other seemingly reasonable proposals do not. To address untestable assumptions associated with our method and the proximal g-formula, we further propose an odds ratio falsification heuristic that flags when to proceed with downstream effect estimation using the inferred proxies. We evaluate our method in synthetic and semi-synthetic settings -- the latter with real-world clinical notes from MIMIC-III and open large language models for zero-shot prediction -- and find that our method produces estimates with low bias. We believe that this text-based design of proxies allows for the use of proximal causal inference in a wider range of scenarios, particularly those for which obtaining suitable proxies from structured data is difficult.</description>

      <title>Desiderata for the Context Use of Question Answering Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prior work has uncovered a set of common problems in state-of-the-art context-based question answering (QA) systems: a lack of attention to the context when the latter conflicts with a model's parametric knowledge, little robustness to noise, and a lack of consistency with their answers. However, most prior work focus on one or two of those problems in isolation, which makes it difficult to see trends across them. We aim to close this gap, by first outlining a set of -- previously discussed as well as novel -- desiderata for QA models. We then survey relevant analysis and methods papers to provide an overview of the state of the field. The second part of our work presents experiments where we evaluate 15 QA systems on 5 datasets according to all desiderata at once. We find many novel trends, including (1) systems that are less susceptible to noise are not necessarily more consistent with their answers when given irrelevant context; (2) most systems that are more susceptible to noise are more likely to correctly answer according to a context that conflicts with their parametric knowledge; and (3) the combination of conflicting knowledge and noise can reduce system performance by up to 96%. As such, our desiderata help increase our understanding of how these models work and reveal potential avenues for improvements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To improve language models' proficiency in mathematical reasoning via continual pretraining, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages base language models for autonomous data selection. Departing from conventional supervised fine-tuning or trained classifiers with human-annotated data, our approach Autonomous Data Selection (AutoDS) utilizes meta-prompted language models as zero-shot verifiers to evaluate and select high-quality mathematical content autonomously. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we continuously pretrained a 7B-parameter language model on our curated dataset, achieving substantial improvements in downstream performance on the MATH, GSM8K, and BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) tasks with a token amount reduced by orders of magnitude compared to previous continual pretraining works. Our method showcases a 2 times increase in pretraining token efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the potential of our approach in enhancing models' mathematical reasoning capabilities. The AutoMathText dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/math-ai/AutoMathText. The code is available at https://github.com/yifanzhang-pro/AutoMathText.</description>

      <title>CultureLLM: Incorporating Cultural Differences into Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are reported to be partial to certain cultures owing to the training data dominance from the English corpora. Since multilingual cultural data are often expensive to collect, existing efforts handle this by prompt engineering or culture-specific pre-training. However, they might overlook the knowledge deficiency of low-resource culture and require extensive computing resources. In this paper, we propose CultureLLM, a cost-effective solution to incorporate cultural differences into LLMs. CultureLLM adopts World Value Survey (WVS) as seed data and generates semantically equivalent training data via the proposed semantic data augmentation. Using only 50 seed samples from WVS with augmented data, we fine-tune culture-specific LLMs and one unified model (CultureLLM-One) for 9 cultures covering rich and low-resource languages. Extensive experiments on 60 culture-related datasets demonstrate that CultureLLM significantly outperforms various counterparts such as GPT-3.5 (by 8.1%) and Gemini Pro (by 9.5%) with comparable performance to GPT-4 or even better. Our human study shows that the generated samples are semantically equivalent to the original samples, providing an effective solution for LLMs augmentation.

      <title>KARL: Knowledge-Aware Retrieval and Representations aid Retention and Learning in Students</title>

Abstract: Flashcard schedulers rely on 1) student models to predict the flashcards a student knows; and 2) teaching policies to pick which cards to show next via these predictions. Prior student models, however, just use study data like the student's past responses, ignoring the text on cards. We propose content-aware scheduling, the first schedulers exploiting flashcard content. To give the first evidence that such schedulers enhance student learning, we build KARL, a simple but effective content-aware student model employing deep knowledge tracing (DKT), retrieval, and BERT to predict student recall. We train KARL by collecting a new dataset of 123,143 study logs on diverse trivia questions. KARL bests existing student models in AUC and calibration error. To ensure our improved predictions lead to better student learning, we create a novel delta-based teaching policy to deploy KARL online. Based on 32 study paths from 27 users, KARL improves learning efficiency over SOTA, showing KARL's strength and encouraging researchers to look beyond historical study data to fully capture student abilities.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Multi-Reward Weighting for Multi-Style Controllable Generation</title>

Abstract: Textual style expresses a diverse set of information, including interpersonal dynamics (e.g., formality) and the author's emotions or attitudes (e.g., disgust). An open question is how language models can be explicitly controlled so that they weave together target styles when generating text: for example, to produce text that is both negative and non-toxic. One approach to such controlled generation is multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL), but how best to combine multiple objectives in a reward function is an open question. In this paper, we investigate various formulations of multi-style rewards, including calibrated outputs from discriminators and dynamic weighting by discriminator gradient magnitudes. We find that our proposed dynamic weighting outperforms static weighting approaches with respect to style control while maintaining linguistic quality, and we explore its effectiveness in 2- and 3-style control.</description>

      <title>Generative Retrieval with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When completing knowledge-intensive tasks, humans sometimes need not just an answer but also a corresponding reference passage for auxiliary reading. Previous methods required obtaining pre-segmented article chunks through additional retrieval models. This paper explores leveraging the parameterized knowledge stored during the pre-training phase of large language models (LLMs) to independently recall reference passage from any starting position. We propose a two-stage framework that simulates the scenario of humans recalling easily forgotten references. Initially, the LLM is prompted to recall document title identifiers to obtain a coarse-grained document set. Then, based on the acquired coarse-grained document set, it recalls fine-grained passage. In the two-stage recall process, we use constrained decoding to ensure that content outside of the stored documents is not generated. To increase speed, we only recall a short prefix in the second stage, then locate its position to retrieve a complete passage. Experiments on KILT knowledge-sensitive tasks have verified that LLMs can independently recall reference passage location in various task forms, and the obtained reference significantly assist downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>DACO: Towards Application-Driven and Comprehensive Data Analysis via Code Generation</title>

Abstract: Data analysis is a crucial analytical process to generate in-depth studies and conclusive insights to comprehensively answer a given user query for tabular data. In this work, we aim to propose new resources and benchmarks to inspire future research on this crucial yet challenging and under-explored task. However, collecting data analysis annotations curated by experts can be prohibitively expensive. We propose to automatically generate high-quality answer annotations leveraging the code-generation capabilities of LLMs with a multi-turn prompting technique. We construct the DACO dataset, containing (1) 440 databases (of tabular data) collected from real-world scenarios, (2) ~2k query-answer pairs that can serve as weak supervision for model training, and (3) a concentrated but high-quality test set with human refined annotations that serves as our main evaluation benchmark. We train a 6B supervised fine-tuning (SFT) model on DACO dataset, and find that the SFT model learns reasonable data analysis capabilities. To further align the models with human preference, we use reinforcement learning to encourage generating analysis perceived by human as helpful, and design a set of dense rewards to propagate the sparse human preference reward to intermediate code generation steps. Our DACO-RL algorithm is evaluated by human annotators to produce more helpful answers than SFT model in 57.72% cases, validating the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

      <title>DIVERSE: A Dataset of YouTube Video Comment Stances with a Data Programming Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Public opinion of military organizations significantly influences their ability to recruit talented individuals. As recruitment efforts increasingly extend into digital spaces like social media, it becomes essential to assess the stance of social media users toward online military content. However, there is a notable lack of data for analyzing opinions on military recruiting efforts online, compounded by challenges in stance labeling, which is crucial for understanding public perceptions. Despite the importance of stance analysis for successful online military recruitment, creating human-annotated, in-domain stance labels is resource-intensive. In this paper, we address both the challenges of stance labeling and the scarcity of data on public opinions of online military recruitment by introducing and releasing the DIVERSE dataset: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10493803. This dataset comprises all comments from the U.S. Army's official YouTube Channel videos. We employed a state-of-the-art weak supervision approach, leveraging large language models to label the stance of each comment toward its respective video and the U.S. Army. Our findings indicate that the U.S. Army's videos began attracting a significant number of comments post-2021, with the stance distribution generally balanced among supportive, oppositional, and neutral comments, with a slight skew towards oppositional versus supportive comments.</description>

      <title>VLKEB: A Large Vision-Language Model Knowledge Editing Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, knowledge editing on large language models (LLMs) has received considerable attention. Compared to this, editing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) faces extra challenges from diverse data modalities and complicated model components, and data for LVLMs editing are limited. The existing LVLM editing benchmark, which comprises three metrics (Reliability, Locality, and Generality), falls short in the quality of synthesized evaluation images and cannot assess whether models apply edited knowledge in relevant content. Therefore, we employ more reliable data collection methods to construct a new Large $\textbf{V}$ision-$\textbf{L}$anguage Model $\textbf{K}$nowledge $\textbf{E}$diting $\textbf{B}$enchmark, $\textbf{VLKEB}$, and extend the Portability metric for more comprehensive evaluation. Leveraging a multi-modal knowledge graph, our image data are bound with knowledge entities. This can be further used to extract entity-related knowledge, which constitutes the base of editing data. We conduct experiments of different editing methods on five LVLMs, and thoroughly analyze how do they impact the models. The results reveal strengths and deficiencies of these methods and hopefully provide insights for future research. The codes and dataset are available at: https://github.com/VLKEB/VLKEB.</description>

      <title>VB-LoRA: Extreme Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning with Vector Banks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the adoption of large language models increases and the need for per-user or per-task model customization grows, the parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and its variants, incur substantial storage and transmission costs. To further reduce stored parameters, we introduce a "divide-and-share" paradigm that breaks the barriers of low-rank decomposition across matrix dimensions, modules, and layers by sharing parameters globally via a vector bank. As an instantiation of the paradigm to LoRA, our proposed VB-LoRA composites all the low-rank matrices of LoRA from a shared vector bank with a differentiable top-k admixture module. VB-LoRA achieves extreme parameter efficiency while maintaining comparable or better performance compared to state-of-the-art PEFT methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of VB-LoRA on natural language understanding, natural language generation, instruction tuning, and mathematical reasoning tasks. When fine-tuning the Llama2-13B model, VB-LoRA only uses 0.4% of LoRA's stored parameters, yet achieves superior results. Our source code is available at https://github.com/leo-yangli/VB-LoRA. This method has been merged into the Hugging Face PEFT package.</description>

      <title>Weak-to-Strong Search: Align Large Language Models via Searching over Small Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models are usually fine-tuned to align with human preferences. However, fine-tuning a large language model can be challenging. In this work, we introduce $\textit{weak-to-strong search}$, framing the alignment of a large language model as a test-time greedy search to maximize the log-probability difference between small tuned and untuned models while sampling from the frozen large model. This method serves both as (1) a compute-efficient model up-scaling strategy that avoids directly tuning the large model and as (2) an instance of weak-to-strong generalization that enhances a strong model with weak test-time guidance. Empirically, we demonstrate the flexibility of weak-to-strong search across different tasks. In controlled-sentiment generation and summarization, we use tuned and untuned $\texttt{gpt2}$s to improve the alignment of large models without additional training. Crucially, in a more difficult instruction-following benchmark, AlpacaEval 2.0, we show that reusing off-the-shelf small models (e.g., $\texttt{zephyr-7b-beta}$ and its untuned version) can improve the length-controlled win rates of both white-box and black-box large models against $\texttt{gpt-4-turbo}$ (e.g., $34.4\% \rightarrow 37.9\%$ for $\texttt{Llama-3-70B-Instruct}$ and $16.0\% \rightarrow 20.1\%$ for $\texttt{gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct}$), despite the small models' low win rates $\approx 10.0\%$.</description>

      <title>A Full-duplex Speech Dialogue Scheme Based On Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generative dialogue system capable of operating in a full-duplex manner, allowing for seamless interaction. It is based on a large language model (LLM) carefully aligned to be aware of a perception module, a motor function module, and the concept of a simple finite state machine (called neural FSM) with two states. The perception and motor function modules operate in tandem, allowing the system to speak and listen to the user simultaneously. The LLM generates textual tokens for inquiry responses and makes autonomous decisions to start responding to, wait for, or interrupt the user by emitting control tokens to the neural FSM. All these tasks of the LLM are carried out as next token prediction on a serialized view of the dialogue in real-time. In automatic quality evaluations simulating real-life interaction, the proposed system reduces the average conversation response latency by more than threefold compared with LLM-based half-duplex dialogue systems while responding within less than 500 milliseconds in more than 50% of evaluated interactions. Running an LLM with only 8 billion parameters, our system exhibits an 8% higher interruption precision rate than the best available commercial LLM for voice-based dialogue.</description>

      <title>Towards a theory of how the structure of language is acquired by deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00048v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How much data is required to learn the structure of a language via next-token prediction? We study this question for synthetic datasets generated via a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) -- a tree-like generative model that captures many of the hierarchical structures found in natural languages. We determine token-token correlations analytically in our model and show that they can be used to build a representation of the grammar's hidden variables, the longer the range the deeper the variable. In addition, a finite training set limits the resolution of correlations to an effective range, whose size grows with that of the training set. As a result, a Language Model trained with increasingly many examples can build a deeper representation of the grammar's structure, thus reaching good performance despite the high dimensionality of the problem. We conjecture that the relationship between training set size and effective range of correlations holds beyond our synthetic datasets. In particular, our conjecture predicts how the scaling law for the test loss behaviour with training set size depends on the length of the context window, which we confirm empirically in Shakespeare's plays and Wikipedia articles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains and are moving towards more specialized areas. Recent advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4 and Gemini have achieved significant advancements in biomedicine, which have also raised privacy and security challenges. The construction of specialized generalists hinges largely on high-quality datasets, enhanced by techniques like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback, and direct preference optimization. However, these leading technologies (e.g., preference learning) are still significantly limited in the open source community due to the scarcity of specialized data. In this paper, we present the UltraMedical collections, which consist of high-quality manual and synthetic datasets in the biomedicine domain, featuring preference annotations across multiple advanced LLMs. By utilizing these datasets, we fine-tune a suite of specialized medical models based on Llama-3 series, demonstrating breathtaking capabilities across various medical benchmarks. Moreover, we develop powerful reward models skilled in biomedical and general reward benchmark, enhancing further online preference learning within the biomedical LLM community.

      <title>On the Worst Prompt Performance of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is acutely sensitive to the phrasing of prompts, which raises significant concerns about their reliability in real-world scenarios. Existing studies often divide prompts into task-level instructions and case-level inputs and primarily focus on evaluating and improving robustness against variations in tasks-level instructions. However, this setup fails to fully address the diversity of real-world user queries and assumes the existence of task-specific datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce RobustAlpacaEval, a new benchmark that consists of semantically equivalent case-level queries and emphasizes the importance of using the worst prompt performance to gauge the lower bound of model performance. Extensive experiments on RobustAlpacaEval with ChatGPT and six open-source LLMs from the Llama, Mistral, and Gemma families uncover substantial variability in model performance; for instance, a difference of 45.48% between the worst and best performance for the Llama-2-70B-chat model, with its worst performance dipping as low as 9.38%. We further illustrate the difficulty in identifying the worst prompt from both model-agnostic and model-dependent perspectives, emphasizing the absence of a shortcut to characterize the worst prompt. We also attempt to enhance the worst prompt performance using existing prompt engineering and prompt consistency methods, but find that their impact is limited. These findings underscore the need to create more resilient LLMs that can maintain high performance across diverse prompts. Data and code are available at https://github.com/cbwbuaa/On-the-Worst-Prompt- Performance-of-LLMs.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Effective $L_2$ Norm-Based Strategy for KV Cache Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11430v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is often hindered by the extensive memory requirements of the Key-Value (KV) cache, especially as context lengths increase. Existing approaches to reduce the KV cache size involve either fine-tuning the model to learn a compression strategy or leveraging attention scores to reduce the sequence length. We analyse the attention distributions in decoder-only Transformers-based models and observe that attention allocation patterns stay consistent across most layers. Surprisingly, we find a clear correlation between the $L_2$ and the attention scores over cached KV pairs, where a low $L_2$ of a key embedding usually leads to a high attention score during decoding. This finding indicates that the influence of a KV pair is potentially determined by the key embedding itself before being queried. Based on this observation, we compress the KV cache based on the $L_2$ of key embeddings. Our experimental results show that this simple strategy can reduce the KV cache size by 50% on language modelling and needle-in-a-haystack tasks and 90% on passkey retrieval tasks without losing accuracy. Moreover, without relying on the attention scores, this approach remains compatible with FlashAttention, enabling broader applicability.</description>

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the safe deployment of neural networks. Existing CLIP-based approaches perform OOD detection by devising novel scoring functions or sophisticated fine-tuning methods. In this work, we propose SeTAR, a novel, training-free OOD detection method that leverages selective low-rank approximation of weight matrices in vision-language and vision-only models. SeTAR enhances OOD detection via post-hoc modification of the model's weight matrices using a simple greedy search algorithm. Based on SeTAR, we further propose SeTAR+FT, a fine-tuning extension optimizing model performance for OOD detection tasks. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet1K and Pascal-VOC benchmarks show SeTAR's superior performance, reducing the relatively false positive rate by up to 18.95% and 36.80% compared to zero-shot and fine-tuning baselines. Ablation studies further validate SeTAR's effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability across different model backbones. Our work offers a scalable, efficient solution for OOD detection, setting a new state-of-the-art in this area.</description>

      <title>Estimating Knowledge in Large Language Models Without Generating a Single Token</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To evaluate knowledge in large language models (LLMs), current methods query the model and then evaluate its generated responses. In this work, we ask whether evaluation can be done before the model has generated any text. Concretely, is it possible to estimate how knowledgeable a model is about a certain entity, only from its internal computation? We study this question with two tasks: given a subject entity, the goal is to predict (a) the ability of the model to answer common questions about the entity, and (b) the factuality of open-ended responses generated by the model about the entity. Experiments with a variety of LLMs show that KEEN, a simple probe trained over internal subject representations, succeeds at both tasks - correlating with both the QA accuracy of the model per-subject and FActScore, a recent factuality metric in open-ended generation. Moreover, KEEN naturally aligns with the model's hedging behavior and faithfully reflects changes in the model's knowledge after fine-tuning. Lastly, we show a more interpretable yet equally performant variant of KEEN, which highlights a small set of tokens indicative of clusters and gaps in the model's knowledge. Being simple and lightweight, KEEN can be leveraged to guide decisions such as when it is appropriate to apply further training or augment queries with retrieval.</description>

      <title>Understanding the RoPE Extensions of Long-Context LLMs: An Attention Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enabling LLMs to handle lengthy context is currently a research hotspot. Most LLMs are built upon rotary position embedding (RoPE), a popular position encoding method. Therefore, a prominent path is to extrapolate the RoPE trained on comparably short texts to far longer texts. A heavy bunch of efforts have been dedicated to boosting the extrapolation via extending the formulations of the RoPE, however, few of them have attempted to showcase their inner workings comprehensively. In this paper, we are driven to offer a straightforward yet in-depth understanding of RoPE extensions from an attention perspective and on two benchmarking tasks. A broad array of experiments reveals several valuable findings: 1) Maintaining attention patterns to those at the pretrained length improves extrapolation; 2) Large attention uncertainty leads to retrieval errors; 3) Using longer continual pretraining lengths for RoPE extensions could reduce attention uncertainty and significantly enhance extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Connecting the Dots: LLMs can Infer and Verbalize Latent Structure from Disparate Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One way to address safety risks from large language models (LLMs) is to censor dangerous knowledge from their training data. While this removes the explicit information, implicit information can remain scattered across various training documents. Could an LLM infer the censored knowledge by piecing together these implicit hints? As a step towards answering this question, we study inductive out-of-context reasoning (OOCR), a type of generalization in which LLMs infer latent information from evidence distributed across training documents and apply it to downstream tasks without in-context learning. Using a suite of five tasks, we demonstrate that frontier LLMs can perform inductive OOCR. In one experiment we finetune an LLM on a corpus consisting only of distances between an unknown city and other known cities. Remarkably, without in-context examples or Chain of Thought, the LLM can verbalize that the unknown city is Paris and use this fact to answer downstream questions. Further experiments show that LLMs trained only on individual coin flip outcomes can verbalize whether the coin is biased, and those trained only on pairs (x, f (x)) can articulate a definition of f and compute inverses. While OOCR succeeds in a range of cases, we also show that it is unreliable, particularly for smaller LLMs learning complex structures. Overall, the ability of LLMs to "connect the dots" without explicit in-context learning poses a potential obstacle to monitoring and controlling the knowledge acquired by LLMs.</description>

      <title>OATH-Frames: Characterizing Online Attitudes Towards Homelessness with LLM Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Warning: Contents of this paper may be upsetting. Public attitudes towards key societal issues, expressed on online media, are of immense value in policy and reform efforts, yet challenging to understand at scale. We study one such social issue: homelessness in the U.S., by leveraging the remarkable capabilities of large language models to assist social work experts in analyzing millions of posts from Twitter. We introduce a framing typology: Online Attitudes Towards Homelessness (OATH) Frames: nine hierarchical frames capturing critiques, responses and perceptions. We release annotations with varying degrees of assistance from language models, with immense benefits in scaling: 6.5x speedup in annotation time while only incurring a 3 point F1 reduction in performance with respect to the domain experts. Our experiments demonstrate the value of modeling OATH-Frames over existing sentiment and toxicity classifiers. Our large-scale analysis with predicted OATH-Frames on 2.4M posts on homelessness reveal key trends in attitudes across states, time periods and vulnerable populations, enabling new insights on the issue. Our work provides a general framework to understand nuanced public attitudes at scale, on issues beyond homelessness.</description>

      <title>Ladder: A Model-Agnostic Framework Boosting LLM-based Machine Translation to the Next Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have achieved remarkable advancements in machine translation (MT) by leveraging extensive web content. On the other hand, translation-specific LLMs are built by pre-training on domain-specific monolingual corpora and fine-tuning with human-annotated translation data. Despite the superior performance, these methods either demand an unprecedented scale of computing and data or substantial human editing and annotation efforts. In this paper, we develop MT-Ladder, a novel model-agnostic and cost-effective tool to refine the performance of general LLMs for MT. MT-Ladder is trained on pseudo-refinement triplets which can be easily obtained from existing LLMs without additional human cost. During training, we propose a hierarchical fine-tuning strategy with an easy-to-hard schema, improving MT-Ladder's refining performance progressively. The trained MT-Ladder can be seamlessly integrated with any general-purpose LLMs to boost their translation performance. By utilizing Gemma-2B/7B as the backbone, MT-Ladder-2B can elevate raw translations to the level of top-tier open-source models (e.g., refining BigTranslate-13B with +6.91 BLEU and +3.52 COMET for XX-En), and MT-Ladder-7B can further enhance model performance to be on par with the state-of-the-art GPT-4. Extensive ablation and analysis corroborate the effectiveness of MT-Ladder in diverse settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/fzp0424/MT-Ladder</description>

      <title>RuleR: Improving LLM Controllability by Rule-based Data Recycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable advancement of Large language models (LLMs), they still lack delicate controllability under sophisticated constraints, which is critical to enhancing their response quality and the user experience. While conditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can potentially improve LLM controllability, curating new SFT data to fulfill the constraints usually relies on human experts or proprietary LLMs, which is time-consuming and expensive. To bridge this gap, we propose Rule-based Data Recycling (RuleR), a human/LLM-free data augmentation method incorporating multiple constraints into the original SFT data. Instead of creating new responses from scratch, RuleR integrates linguistic or formatting rules into the original instructions and modifies the responses to fulfill the rule-defined constraints. Training on the "recycled" data consolidates LLMs capability to generate constrained outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate RuleR's effectiveness in improving LLM controllability while maintaining general instruction-following performance. RuleR's code is released on https://github.com/tianyi-lab/RuleR.</description>

      <title>It Is Not About What You Say, It Is About How You Say It: A Surprisingly Simple Approach for Improving Reading Comprehension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural language processing has seen rapid progress over the past decade. Due to the speed of developments, some practices get established without proper evaluation. Considering one such case and focusing on reading comprehension, we ask our first research question: 1) How does the order of inputs -- i.e., question and context -- affect model performance? Additionally, given recent advancements in input emphasis, we ask a second research question: 2) Does emphasizing either the question, the context, or both enhance performance? Experimenting with 9 large language models across 3 datasets, we find that presenting the context before the question improves model performance, with an accuracy increase of up to $31\%$. Furthermore, emphasizing the context yields superior results compared to question emphasis, and in general, emphasizing parts of the input is particularly effective for addressing questions that models lack the parametric knowledge to answer. Experimenting with both prompt-based and attention-based emphasis methods, we additionally find that the best method is surprisingly simple: it only requires concatenating a few tokens to the input and results in an accuracy improvement of up to $36\%$, allowing smaller models to outperform their significantly larger counterparts.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Clinical Evidence Synthesis with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthesizing clinical evidence largely relies on systematic reviews of clinical trials and retrospective analyses from medical literature. However, the rapid expansion of publications presents challenges in efficiently identifying, summarizing, and updating clinical evidence. Here, we introduce TrialMind, a generative artificial intelligence (AI) pipeline for facilitating human-AI collaboration in three crucial tasks for evidence synthesis: study search, screening, and data extraction. To assess its performance, we chose published systematic reviews to build the benchmark dataset, named TrialReviewBench, which contains 100 systematic reviews and the associated 2,220 clinical studies. Our results show that TrialMind excels across all three tasks. In study search, it generates diverse and comprehensive search queries to achieve high recall rates (Ours 0.711-0.834 v.s. Human baseline 0.138-0.232). For study screening, TrialMind surpasses traditional embedding-based methods by 30% to 160%. In data extraction, it outperforms a GPT-4 baseline by 29.6% to 61.5%. We further conducted user studies to confirm its practical utility. Compared to manual efforts, human-AI collaboration using TrialMind yielded a 71.4% recall lift and 44.2% time savings in study screening and a 23.5% accuracy lift and 63.4% time savings in data extraction. Additionally, when comparing synthesized clinical evidence presented in forest plots, medical experts favored TrialMind's outputs over GPT-4's outputs in 62.5% to 100% of cases. These findings show the promise of LLM-based approaches like TrialMind to accelerate clinical evidence synthesis via streamlining study search, screening, and data extraction from medical literature, with exceptional performance improvement when working with human experts.</description>

      <title>Compare without Despair: Reliable Preference Evaluation with Generation Separability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human evaluation of generated language through pairwise preference judgments is pervasive. However, under common scenarios, such as when generations from a model pair are very similar, or when stochastic decoding results in large variations in generations, it results in inconsistent preference ratings. We address these challenges by introducing a meta-evaluation measure, separability, which estimates how suitable a test instance is for pairwise preference evaluation. For a candidate test instance, separability samples multiple generations from a pair of models, and measures how distinguishable the two sets of generations are. Our experiments show that instances with high separability values yield more consistent preference ratings from both human- and auto-raters. Further, the distribution of separability allows insights into which test benchmarks are more valuable for comparing models. Finally, we incorporate separability into ELO ratings, accounting for how suitable each test instance might be for reliably ranking LLMs. Overall, separability has implications for consistent, efficient and robust preference evaluation of LLMs with both human- and auto-raters.</description>

      <title>Pelican: Correcting Hallucination in Vision-LLMs via Claim Decomposition and Program of Thought Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) struggle with hallucinations in visual instruction following task(s), limiting their trustworthiness and real-world applicability. We propose Pelican -- a novel framework designed to detect and mitigate hallucinations through claim verification. Pelican first decomposes the visual claim into a chain of sub-claims based on first-order predicates. These sub-claims consist of (predicate, question) pairs and can be conceptualized as nodes of a computational graph. We then use Program-of-Thought prompting to generate Python code for answering these questions through flexible composition of external tools. Pelican improves over prior work by introducing (1) intermediate variables for precise grounding of object instances, and (2) shared computation for answering the sub-question to enable adaptive corrections and inconsistency identification. We finally use reasoning abilities of LLMs to verify the correctness of the claim by considering the consistency and confidence of the (question, answer) pairs from each sub-claim. Our experiments reveal a drop in hallucination rate by ~ 8% - 32% across various baseline LVLMs and a 27% drop compared to approaches proposed for hallucination mitigation on MMHal-Bench. Results on two other benchmarks further corroborate our results.</description>

      <title>Context Embeddings for Efficient Answer Generation in RAG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) allows overcoming the limited knowledge of LLMs by extending the input with external information. As a consequence, the contextual inputs to the model become much longer which slows down decoding time directly translating to the time a user has to wait for an answer. We address this challenge by presenting COCOM, an effective context compression method, reducing long contexts to only a handful of Context Embeddings speeding up the generation time by a large margin. Our method allows for different compression rates trading off decoding time for answer quality. Compared to earlier methods, COCOM allows for handling multiple contexts more effectively, significantly reducing decoding time for long inputs. Our method demonstrates a speed-up of up to 5.69 $\times$ while achieving higher performance compared to existing efficient context compression methods.</description>

      <title>MambaForGCN: Enhancing Long-Range Dependency with State Space Model and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) evaluates sentiments toward specific aspects of entities within the text. However, attention mechanisms and neural network models struggle with syntactic constraints. The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms also limits their adoption for capturing long-range dependencies between aspect and opinion words in ABSA. This complexity can lead to the misinterpretation of irrelevant contextual words, restricting their effectiveness to short-range dependencies. To address the above problem, we present a novel approach to enhance long-range dependencies between aspect and opinion words in ABSA (MambaForGCN). This approach incorporates syntax-based Graph Convolutional Network (SynGCN) and MambaFormer (Mamba-Transformer) modules to encode input with dependency relations and semantic information. The Multihead Attention (MHA) and Selective State Space model (Mamba) blocks in the MambaFormer module serve as channels to enhance the model with short and long-range dependencies between aspect and opinion words. We also introduce the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) gated fusion, an adaptive feature representation system that integrates SynGCN and MambaFormer and captures non-linear, complex dependencies. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate MambaForGCN's effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline models.</description>

      <title>Towards a Unified View of Preference Learning for Large Language Models: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02795v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkably powerful capabilities. One of the crucial factors to achieve success is aligning the LLM's output with human preferences. This alignment process often requires only a small amount of data to efficiently enhance the LLM's performance. While effective, research in this area spans multiple domains, and the methods involved are relatively complex to understand. The relationships between different methods have been under-explored, limiting the development of the preference alignment. In light of this, we break down the existing popular alignment strategies into different components and provide a unified framework to study the current alignment strategies, thereby establishing connections among them. In this survey, we decompose all the strategies in preference learning into four components: model, data, feedback, and algorithm. This unified view offers an in-depth understanding of existing alignment algorithms and also opens up possibilities to synergize the strengths of different strategies. Furthermore, we present detailed working examples of prevalent existing algorithms to facilitate a comprehensive understanding for the readers. Finally, based on our unified perspective, we explore the challenges and future research directions for aligning large language models with human preferences.</description>

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation across the whole range of LLM applications.</description>

Abstract: Linguistically inclusive LLMs -- which maintain good performance regardless of the language with which they are prompted -- are necessary for the diffusion of AI benefits around the world. Multilingual jailbreaks that rely on language translation to evade safety measures undermine the safe and inclusive deployment of AI systems. We provide policy recommendations to enhance the multilingual capabilities of AI while mitigating the risks of multilingual jailbreaks. We examine how a language's level of resourcing relates to how vulnerable LLMs are to multilingual jailbreaks in that language. We do this by testing five advanced AI models across 24 official languages of the EU. Building on prior research, we propose policy actions that align with the EU legal landscape and institutional framework to address multilingual jailbreaks, while promoting linguistic inclusivity. These include mandatory assessments of multilingual capabilities and vulnerabilities, public opinion research, and state support for multilingual AI development. The measures aim to improve AI safety and functionality through EU policy initiatives, guiding the implementation of the EU AI Act and informing regulatory efforts of the European AI Office.</description>

      <title>Balancing Cost and Effectiveness of Synthetic Data Generation Strategies for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are applied to more use cases, creating high quality, task-specific datasets for fine-tuning becomes a bottleneck for model improvement. Using high quality human data has been the most common approach to unlock model performance, but is prohibitively expensive in many scenarios. Several alternative methods have also emerged, such as generating synthetic or hybrid data, but the effectiveness of these approaches remain unclear, especially in resource-constrained scenarios and tasks that are not easily verified. To investigate this, we group various synthetic data generation strategies into three representative categories -- Answer Augmentation, Question Rephrase and New Question -- and study the performance of student LLMs trained under various constraints, namely seed instruction set size and query budget. We demonstrate that these strategies are not equally effective across settings. Notably, the optimal data generation strategy depends strongly on the ratio between the available teacher query budget and the size of the seed instruction set. When this ratio is low, generating new answers to existing questions proves most effective, but as this ratio increases, generating new questions becomes optimal. Across all tasks, we find that choice of augmentation method and other design choices matter substantially more in low to mid data regimes than in high data regimes. We provide a practical framework for selecting the appropriate augmentation method across settings, taking into account additional factors such as the scalability of each method, the importance of verifying synthetic data, and the use of different LLMs for synthetic data generation.</description>

      <title>PAD: Personalized Alignment at Decoding-Time</title>

Abstract: Aligning with personalized preferences, which vary significantly across cultural, educational, and political differences, poses a significant challenge due to the computational costs and data demands of traditional alignment methods. In response, this paper presents Personalized Alignment at Decoding-time (PAD), a novel framework designed to align LLM outputs with diverse personalized preferences during the inference phase, eliminating the need for additional training. By introducing a unique personalized reward modeling strategy, this framework decouples the text generation process from personalized preferences, facilitating the generation of generalizable token-level personalized rewards. The PAD algorithm leverages these rewards to guide the decoding process, dynamically tailoring the base model's predictions to personalized preferences. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PAD not only outperforms existing training-based alignment methods in terms of aligning with diverse preferences but also shows significant generalizability to preferences unseen during training and scalability across different base models. This work advances the capability of LLMs to meet user needs in real-time applications, presenting a substantial step forward in personalized LLM alignment.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Question Answering: Enhancing Language Model Proficiency for Addressing Knowledge Conflicts with Source Citations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resolving knowledge conflicts is a crucial challenge in Question Answering (QA) tasks, as the internet contains numerous conflicting facts and opinions. While some research has made progress in tackling ambiguous settings where multiple valid answers exist, these approaches often neglect to provide source citations, leaving users to evaluate the factuality of each answer. On the other hand, existing work on citation generation has focused on unambiguous settings with single answers, failing to address the complexity of real-world scenarios. Despite the importance of both aspects, no prior research has combined them, leaving a significant gap in the development of QA systems. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing the novel task of QA with source citation in ambiguous settings, where multiple valid answers exist. To facilitate research in this area, we create a comprehensive framework consisting of: (1) five novel datasets, obtained by augmenting three existing reading comprehension datasets with citation meta-data across various ambiguous settings, such as distractors and paraphrasing; (2) the first ambiguous multi-hop QA dataset featuring real-world, naturally occurring contexts; (3) two new metrics to evaluate models' performances; and (4) several strong baselines using rule-based, prompting, and finetuning approaches over five large language models. We hope that this new task, datasets, metrics, and baselines will inspire the community to push the boundaries of QA research and develop more trustworthy and interpretable systems.</description>

      <title>Simplicity Prevails: Rethinking Negative Preference Optimization for LLM Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of large language model (LLM) unlearning, aiming to remove unwanted data influences and associated model capabilities (e.g., copyrighted data or harmful content generation) while preserving essential model utilities, without the need for retraining from scratch. Despite the growing need for LLM unlearning, a principled optimization framework remains lacking. To this end, we revisit the state-of-the-art approach, negative preference optimization (NPO), and identify the issue of reference model bias, which could undermine NPO's effectiveness, particularly when unlearning forget data of varying difficulty. Given that, we propose a simple yet effective unlearning optimization framework, called SimNPO, showing that 'simplicity' in removing the reliance on a reference model (through the lens of simple preference optimization) benefits unlearning. We also provide deeper insights into SimNPO's advantages, supported by analysis using mixtures of Markov chains. Furthermore, we present extensive experiments validating SimNPO's superiority over existing unlearning baselines in benchmarks like TOFU and MUSE, and robustness against relearning attacks. Codes are available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/Unlearn-Simple.</description>

      <title>NoVo: Norm Voting off Hallucinations with Attention Heads in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) remain a major obstacle, particularly in high-stakes applications where factual accuracy is critical. While representation editing and reading methods have made strides in reducing hallucinations, their heavy reliance on specialised tools and training on in-domain samples, makes them difficult to scale and prone to overfitting. This limits their accuracy gains and generalizability to diverse datasets. This paper presents a lightweight method, Norm Voting (NoVo), which harnesses the untapped potential of attention head norms to dramatically enhance factual accuracy in zero-shot multiple-choice questions (MCQs). NoVo begins by automatically selecting truth-correlated head norms with an efficient, inference-only algorithm using only 30 random samples, allowing NoVo to effortlessly scale to diverse datasets. Afterwards, selected head norms are employed in a simple voting algorithm, which yields significant gains in prediction accuracy. On TruthfulQA MC1, NoVo surpasses the current state-of-the-art and all previous methods by an astounding margin -- at least 19 accuracy points. NoVo demonstrates exceptional generalization to 20 diverse datasets, with significant gains in over 90\% of them, far exceeding all current representation editing and reading methods. NoVo also reveals promising gains to finetuning strategies and building textual adversarial defence. NoVo's effectiveness with head norms opens new frontiers in LLM interpretability, robustness and reliability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reward models (RMs) have driven the state-of-the-art performance of LLMs today by enabling the integration of human feedback into the language modeling process. However, RMs are primarily trained and evaluated in English, and their capabilities in multilingual settings remain largely understudied. In this work, we conduct a systematic evaluation of several reward models in multilingual settings. We first construct the first-of-its-kind multilingual RM evaluation benchmark, M-RewardBench, consisting of 2.87k preference instances for 23 typologically diverse languages, that tests the chat, safety, reasoning, and translation capabilities of RMs. We then rigorously evaluate a wide range of reward models on M-RewardBench, offering fresh insights into their performance across diverse languages. We identify a significant gap in RMs' performances between English and non-English languages and show that RM preferences can change substantially from one language to another. We also present several findings on how different multilingual aspects impact RM performance. Specifically, we show that the performance of RMs is improved with improved translation quality. Similarly, we demonstrate that the models exhibit better performance for high-resource languages. We release M-RewardBench dataset and the codebase in this study to facilitate a better understanding of RM evaluation in multilingual settings.</description>

      <title>Do Robot Snakes Dream like Electric Sheep? Investigating the Effects of Architectural Inductive Biases on Hallucination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growth in prominence of large language models (LLMs) in everyday life can be largely attributed to their generative abilities, yet some of this is also owed to the risks and costs associated with their use. On one front is their tendency to \textit{hallucinate} false or misleading information, limiting their reliability. On another is the increasing focus on the computational limitations associated with traditional self-attention based LLMs, which has brought about new alternatives, in particular recurrent models, meant to overcome them. Yet it remains uncommon to consider these two concerns simultaneously. Do changes in architecture exacerbate/alleviate existing concerns about hallucinations? Do they affect how and where they occur? Through an extensive evaluation, we study how these architecture-based inductive biases affect the propensity to hallucinate. While hallucination remains a general phenomenon not limited to specific architectures, the situations in which they occur and the ease with which specific types of hallucinations can be induced can significantly differ based on the model architecture. These findings highlight the need for better understanding both these problems in conjunction with each other, as well as consider how to design more universal techniques for handling hallucinations.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Preferences: Learning to Route Instances for Human vs. AI Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning from human feedback has enabled the alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences. However, directly collecting human preferences can be expensive, time-consuming, and can have high variance. An appealing alternative is to distill preferences from LMs as a source of synthetic annotations as they are more consistent, cheaper, and scale better than human annotation; however, they are also prone to biases and errors. In this work, we introduce a routing framework that combines inputs from humans and LMs to achieve better annotation quality, while reducing the total cost of human annotation. The crux of our approach is to identify preference instances that will benefit from human annotations. We formulate this as an optimization problem: given a preference dataset and an evaluation metric, we train a performance prediction model to predict a reward model's performance on an arbitrary combination of human and LM annotations and employ a routing strategy that selects a combination that maximizes predicted performance. We train the performance prediction model on MultiPref, a new preference dataset with 10K instances paired with human and LM labels. We show that the selected hybrid mixture of LM and direct human preferences using our routing framework achieves better reward model performance compared to using either one exclusively. We simulate selective human preference collection on three other datasets and show that our method generalizes well to all three. We analyze features from the routing model to identify characteristics of instances that can benefit from human feedback, e.g., prompts with a moderate safety concern or moderate intent complexity. We release the dataset, annotation platform, and source code used in this study to foster more efficient and accurate preference collection in the future.</description>

      <title>Not All Heads Matter: A Head-Level KV Cache Compression Method with Integrated Retrieval and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Key-Value (KV) caching is a common technique to enhance the computational efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs), but its memory overhead grows rapidly with input length. Prior work has shown that not all tokens are equally important for text generation, proposing layer-level KV cache compression to selectively retain key information. Recognizing the distinct roles of attention heads in generation, we propose HeadKV, a head-level KV cache compression method, and HeadKV-R2, which leverages a novel contextual reasoning ability estimation for compression. Our approach operates at the level of individual heads, estimating their importance for contextual QA tasks that require both retrieval and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks (LongBench, LooGLE), model architectures (e.g., Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct), and long-context abilities tests demonstrate that our head-level KV cache compression significantly outperforms strong baselines, particularly in low-resource settings (KV size = 64 &amp; 128). Notably, our method retains just 1.5% of the KV cache while achieving 97% of the performance of the full KV cache on the contextual question answering benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using large language models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate responses due to the retrieval of irrelevant or loosely related information. Existing methods, which operate at the document level, fail to effectively filter out such content. We propose LLM-driven chunk filtering, ChunkRAG, a framework that enhances RAG systems by evaluating and filtering retrieved information at the chunk level. Our approach employs semantic chunking to divide documents into coherent sections and utilizes LLM-based relevance scoring to assess each chunk's alignment with the user's query. By filtering out less pertinent chunks before the generation phase, we significantly reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing RAG models, achieving higher accuracy on tasks requiring precise information retrieval. This advancement enhances the reliability of RAG systems, making them particularly beneficial for applications like fact-checking and multi-hop reasoning.</description>

      <title>Counting Ability of Large Language Models and Impact of Tokenization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers, the backbone of modern large language models (LLMs), face inherent architectural limitations that impede their reasoning capabilities. Unlike recurrent networks, Transformers lack recurrent connections, confining them to constant-depth computation. This restriction places them in the complexity class TC$^0$, making them theoretically incapable of solving tasks that demand increasingly deep reasoning as input length grows. Counting, a fundamental component of many reasoning tasks, also requires reasoning depth to grow linearly to be performed inductively. While previous studies have established the upper limits of counting ability in Transformer-based expert models (i.e., models specifically trained for counting tasks), these findings do not directly extend to general-purpose LLMs due to differences in reasoning mechanisms. Recent work has highlighted how Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning can help alleviate some of the architectural limitations of Transformers in counting tasks. However, little attention has been paid to the role of tokenization in these models. Unlike expert models that often use character-level tokenization, LLMs typically rely on byte-level (BPE) tokenizers, which fundamentally alters the way reasoning is processed. Our work investigates the impact of tokenization on the counting abilities of LLMs, uncovering substantial performance variations based on input tokenization differences. We provide both theoretical and experimental analyses, offering insights into how tokenization choices can undermine models' theoretical computability, thereby inspiring the design of new tokenization methods to enhance reasoning in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Instruction-Tuned LLMs Succeed in Document-Level MT Without Fine-Tuning -- But BLEU Turns a Blind Eye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have excelled in various NLP tasks, including machine translation (MT), yet most studies focus on sentence-level translation. This work investigates the inherent capability of instruction-tuned LLMs for document-level translation (docMT). Unlike prior approaches that require specialized techniques, we evaluate LLMs by directly prompting them to translate entire documents in a single pass. Our results show that this method improves translation quality compared to translating sentences separately, even without document-level fine-tuning. However, this advantage is not reflected in BLEU scores, which often favor sentence-based translations. We propose using the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm for evaluation, where GPT-4 is used to assess document coherence, accuracy, and fluency in a more nuanced way than n-gram-based metrics. Overall, our work demonstrates that instruction-tuned LLMs can effectively leverage document context for translation. However, we caution against using BLEU scores for evaluating docMT, as they often provide misleading outcomes, failing to capture the quality of document-level translation.

Abstract: As the parameter size of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to expand, there is an urgent need to address the scarcity of high-quality data. In response, existing research has attempted to make a breakthrough by incorporating Federated Learning (FL) into LLMs. Conversely, considering the outstanding performance of LLMs in task generalization, researchers have also tried applying LLMs within FL to tackle challenges in relevant domains. The complementarity between LLMs and FL has already ignited widespread research interest. In this paper, we aim to deeply explore the integration of LLMs and FL. We propose a research framework, dividing the fusion of LLMs and FL into three parts: the combination of LLM sub-technologies with FL, the integration of FL sub-technologies with LLMs, and the overall merger of LLMs and FL. We first provide a comprehensive review of the current state of research in the domain of LLMs combined with FL, including their typical applications, integration advantages, challenges faced, and future directions for resolution. Subsequently, we discuss the practical applications of the combination of LLMs and FL in critical scenarios such as healthcare, finance, and education, and provide new perspectives and insights into future research directions for LLMs and FL.</description>

      <title>Vaccine: Perturbation-aware Alignment for Large Language Models against Harmful Fine-tuning Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01109v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The new paradigm of finetuning-as-a-service introduces a new attack surface for Large Language Models (LLMs): a few harmful data uploaded by users can easily trick the finetuning to produce an alignment-broken model. We conduct an empirical analysis and uncover a \textit{harmful embedding drift} phenomenon, showing a probable cause of the alignment-broken effect. Inspired by our findings, we propose Vaccine, a perturbation-aware alignment technique to mitigate the security risk of users finetuning. The core idea of Vaccine is to produce invariant hidden embeddings by progressively adding crafted perturbation to them in the alignment phase. This enables the embeddings to withstand harmful perturbation from un-sanitized user data in the finetuning phase. Our results on open source mainstream LLMs (e.g., Llama2, Opt, Vicuna) demonstrate that Vaccine can boost the robustness of alignment against harmful prompts induced embedding drift while reserving reasoning ability towards benign prompts. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/git-disl/Vaccine}.</description>

      <title>Watch Out for Your Agents! Investigating Backdoor Threats to LLM-Based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven by the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have been developed to handle various real-world applications, including finance, healthcare, and shopping, etc. It is crucial to ensure the reliability and security of LLM-based agents during applications. However, the safety issues of LLM-based agents are currently under-explored. In this work, we take the first step to investigate one of the typical safety threats, backdoor attack, to LLM-based agents. We first formulate a general framework of agent backdoor attacks, then we present a thorough analysis of different forms of agent backdoor attacks. Specifically, compared with traditional backdoor attacks on LLMs that are only able to manipulate the user inputs and model outputs, agent backdoor attacks exhibit more diverse and covert forms: (1) From the perspective of the final attacking outcomes, the agent backdoor attacker can not only choose to manipulate the final output distribution, but also introduce the malicious behavior in an intermediate reasoning step only, while keeping the final output correct. (2) Furthermore, the former category can be divided into two subcategories based on trigger locations, in which the backdoor trigger can either be hidden in the user query or appear in an intermediate observation returned by the external environment. We implement the above variations of agent backdoor attacks on two typical agent tasks including web shopping and tool utilization. Extensive experiments show that LLM-based agents suffer severely from backdoor attacks and such backdoor vulnerability cannot be easily mitigated by current textual backdoor defense algorithms. This indicates an urgent need for further research on the development of targeted defenses against backdoor attacks on LLM-based agents. Warning: This paper may contain biased content.</description>

      <title>Value Preferences Estimation and Disambiguation in Hybrid Participatory Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding citizens' values in participatory systems is crucial for citizen-centric policy-making. We envision a hybrid participatory system where participants make choices and provide motivations for those choices, and AI agents estimate their value preferences by interacting with them. We focus on situations where a conflict is detected between participants' choices and motivations, and propose methods for estimating value preferences while addressing detected inconsistencies by interacting with the participants. We operationalize the philosophical stance that ``valuing is deliberatively consequential." That is, if a participant's choice is based on a deliberation of value preferences, the value preferences can be observed in the motivation the participant provides for the choice. Thus, we propose and compare value preferences estimation methods that prioritize the values estimated from motivations over the values estimated from choices alone. Then, we introduce a disambiguation strategy that combines Natural Language Processing and Active Learning to address the detected inconsistencies between choices and motivations. We evaluate the proposed methods on a dataset of a large-scale survey on energy transition. The results show that explicitly addressing inconsistencies between choices and motivations improves the estimation of an individual's value preferences. The disambiguation strategy does not show substantial improvements when compared to similar baselines -- however, we discuss how the novelty of the approach can open new research avenues and propose improvements to address the current limitations.</description>

      <title>Forging the Forger: An Attempt to Improve Authorship Verification via Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Authorship Verification (AV) is a text classification task concerned with inferring whether a candidate text has been written by one specific author or by someone else. It has been shown that many AV systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where a malicious author actively tries to fool the classifier by either concealing their writing style, or by imitating the style of another author. In this paper, we investigate the potential benefits of augmenting the classifier training set with (negative) synthetic examples. These synthetic examples are generated to imitate the style of the author of interest. We analyze the improvements in classifier prediction that this augmentation brings to bear in the task of AV in an adversarial setting. In particular, we experiment with three different generator architectures (one based on Recurrent Neural Networks, another based on small-scale transformers, and another based on the popular GPT model) and with two training strategies (one inspired by standard Language Models, and another inspired by Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks). We evaluate our hypothesis on five datasets (three of which have been specifically collected to represent an adversarial setting) and using two learning algorithms for the AV classifier (Support Vector Machines and Convolutional Neural Networks). This experimentation has yielded negative results, revealing that, although our methodology proves effective in many adversarial settings, its benefits are too sporadic for a pragmatical application.</description>

      <title>Can large language models explore in-context?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15371v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the extent to which contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) can engage in exploration, a core capability in reinforcement learning and decision making. We focus on native performance of existing LLMs, without training interventions. We deploy LLMs as agents in simple multi-armed bandit environments, specifying the environment description and interaction history entirely in-context, i.e., within the LLM prompt. We experiment with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama2, using a variety of prompt designs, and find that the models do not robustly engage in exploration without substantial interventions: i) Across all of our experiments, only one configuration resulted in satisfactory exploratory behavior: GPT-4 with chain-of-thought reasoning and an externally summarized interaction history, presented as sufficient statistics; ii) All other configurations did not result in robust exploratory behavior, including those with chain-of-thought reasoning but unsummarized history. Although these findings can be interpreted positively, they suggest that external summarization -- which may not be possible in more complex settings -- is important for obtaining desirable behavior from LLM agents. We conclude that non-trivial algorithmic interventions, such as fine-tuning or dataset curation, may be required to empower LLM-based decision making agents in complex settings.</description>

      <title>No "Zero-Shot" Without Exponential Data: Pretraining Concept Frequency Determines Multimodal Model Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Web-crawled pretraining datasets underlie the impressive "zero-shot" evaluation performance of multimodal models, such as CLIP for classification/retrieval and Stable-Diffusion for image generation. However, it is unclear how meaningful the notion of "zero-shot" generalization is for such multimodal models, as it is not known to what extent their pretraining datasets encompass the downstream concepts targeted for during "zero-shot" evaluation. In this work, we ask: How is the performance of multimodal models on downstream concepts influenced by the frequency of these concepts in their pretraining datasets? We comprehensively investigate this question across 34 models and five standard pretraining datasets (CC-3M, CC-12M, YFCC-15M, LAION-400M, LAION-Aesthetics), generating over 300GB of data artifacts. We consistently find that, far from exhibiting "zero-shot" generalization, multimodal models require exponentially more data to achieve linear improvements in downstream "zero-shot" performance, following a sample inefficient log-linear scaling trend. This trend persists even when controlling for sample-level similarity between pretraining and downstream datasets, and testing on purely synthetic data distributions. Furthermore, upon benchmarking models on long-tailed data sampled based on our analysis, we demonstrate that multimodal models across the board perform poorly. We contribute this long-tail test set as the "Let it Wag!" benchmark to further research in this direction. Taken together, our study reveals an exponential need for training data which implies that the key to "zero-shot" generalization capabilities under large-scale training paradigms remains to be found.</description>

      <title>CodeCloak: A Method for Evaluating and Mitigating Code Leakage by LLM Code Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM-based code assistants are becoming increasingly popular among developers. These tools help developers improve their coding efficiency and reduce errors by providing real-time suggestions based on the developer's codebase. While beneficial, the use of these tools can inadvertently expose the developer's proprietary code to the code assistant service provider during the development process. In this work, we propose a method to mitigate the risk of code leakage when using LLM-based code assistants. CodeCloak is a novel deep reinforcement learning agent that manipulates the prompts before sending them to the code assistant service. CodeCloak aims to achieve the following two contradictory goals: (i) minimizing code leakage, while (ii) preserving relevant and useful suggestions for the developer. Our evaluation, employing StarCoder and Code Llama, LLM-based code assistants models, demonstrates CodeCloak's effectiveness on a diverse set of code repositories of varying sizes, as well as its transferability across different models. We also designed a method for reconstructing the developer's original codebase from code segments sent to the code assistant service (i.e., prompts) during the development process, to thoroughly analyze code leakage risks and evaluate the effectiveness of CodeCloak under practical development scenarios.</description>

      <title>ImageInWords: Unlocking Hyper-Detailed Image Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the longstanding adage "an image is worth a thousand words," generating accurate hyper-detailed image descriptions remains unsolved. Trained on short web-scraped image text, vision-language models often generate incomplete descriptions with visual inconsistencies. We address this via a novel data-centric approach with ImageInWords (IIW), a carefully designed human-in-the-loop framework for curating hyper-detailed image descriptions. Human evaluations on IIW data show major gains compared to recent datasets (+66%) and GPT4V (+48%) across comprehensiveness, specificity, hallucinations, and more. We also show that fine-tuning with IIW data improves these metrics by +31% against models trained with prior work, even with only 9k samples. Lastly, we evaluate IIW models with text-to-image generation and vision-language reasoning tasks. Our generated descriptions result in the highest fidelity images, and boost compositional reasoning by up to 6% on ARO, SVO-Probes, and Winoground datasets. We release the IIW Eval benchmark with human judgement labels, object and image-level annotations from our framework, and existing image caption datasets enriched via IIW-model.</description>

      <title>Improving Gloss-free Sign Language Translation by Reducing Representation Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gloss-free sign language translation (SLT) aims to develop well-performing SLT systems with no requirement for the costly gloss annotations, but currently still lags behind gloss-based approaches significantly. In this paper, we identify a representation density problem that could be a bottleneck in restricting the performance of gloss-free SLT. Specifically, the representation density problem describes that the visual representations of semantically distinct sign gestures tend to be closely packed together in feature space, which makes gloss-free methods struggle with distinguishing different sign gestures and suffer from a sharp performance drop. To address the representation density problem, we introduce a simple but effective contrastive learning strategy, namely SignCL, which encourages gloss-free models to learn more discriminative feature representation in a self-supervised manner. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed SignCL can significantly reduce the representation density and improve performance across various translation frameworks. Specifically, SignCL achieves a significant improvement in BLEU score for the Sign Language Transformer and GFSLT-VLP on the CSL-Daily dataset by 39% and 46%, respectively, without any increase of model parameters. Compared to Sign2GPT, a state-of-the-art method based on large-scale pre-trained vision and language models, SignCL achieves better performance with only 35% of its parameters. Implementation and Checkpoints are available at https://github.com/JinhuiYE/SignCL.</description>

      <title>CulturePark: Boosting Cross-cultural Understanding in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cultural bias is pervasive in many large language models (LLMs), largely due to the deficiency of data representative of different cultures. Typically, cultural datasets and benchmarks are constructed either by extracting subsets of existing datasets or by aggregating from platforms such as Wikipedia and social media. However, these approaches are highly dependent on real-world data and human annotations, making them costly and difficult to scale. Inspired by cognitive theories on social communication, this paper introduces CulturePark, an LLM-powered multi-agent communication framework for cultural data collection. CulturePark simulates cross-cultural human communication with LLM-based agents playing roles in different cultures. It generates high-quality cross-cultural dialogues encapsulating human beliefs, norms, and customs. Using CulturePark, we generated 41,000 cultural samples to fine-tune eight culture-specific LLMs. We evaluated these models across three downstream tasks: content moderation, cultural alignment, and cultural education. Results show that for content moderation, our GPT-3.5-based models either match or outperform GPT-4 on datasets. Regarding cultural alignment, our models surpass GPT-4 on Hofstede's VSM 13 framework. Furthermore, for cultural education of human participants, our models demonstrate superior outcomes in both learning efficacy and user experience compared to GPT-4. CulturePark proves an important step in addressing cultural bias and advancing the democratization of AI, highlighting the critical role of culturally inclusive data in model training.

      <title>Prompt Optimization with EASE? Efficient Ordering-aware Automated Selection of Exemplars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in real-world applications. The capability of in-context learning (ICL) allows us to adapt an LLM to downstream tasks by including input-label exemplars in the prompt without model fine-tuning. However, the quality of these exemplars in the prompt greatly impacts performance, highlighting the need for an effective automated exemplar selection method. Recent studies have explored retrieval-based approaches to select exemplars tailored to individual test queries, which can be undesirable due to extra test-time computation and an increased risk of data exposure. Moreover, existing methods fail to adequately account for the impact of exemplar ordering on the performance. On the other hand, the impact of the instruction, another essential component in the prompt given to the LLM, is often overlooked in existing exemplar selection methods. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named EASE, which leverages the hidden embedding from a pre-trained language model to represent ordered sets of exemplars and uses a neural bandit algorithm to optimize the sets of exemplars while accounting for exemplar ordering. Our EASE can efficiently find an ordered set of exemplars that performs well for all test queries from a given task, thereby eliminating test-time computation. Importantly, EASE can be readily extended to jointly optimize both the exemplars and the instruction. Through extensive empirical evaluations (including novel tasks), we demonstrate the superiority of EASE over existing methods, and reveal practical insights about the impact of exemplar selection on ICL, which may be of independent interest. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhaoxuanWu/EASE-Prompt-Optimization.</description>

      <title>Bileve: Securing Text Provenance in Large Language Models Against Spoofing with Bi-level Signature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01946v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text watermarks for large language models (LLMs) have been commonly used to identify the origins of machine-generated content, which is promising for assessing liability when combating deepfake or harmful content. While existing watermarking techniques typically prioritize robustness against removal attacks, unfortunately, they are vulnerable to spoofing attacks: malicious actors can subtly alter the meanings of LLM-generated responses or even forge harmful content, potentially misattributing blame to the LLM developer. To overcome this, we introduce a bi-level signature scheme, Bileve, which embeds fine-grained signature bits for integrity checks (mitigating spoofing attacks) as well as a coarse-grained signal to trace text sources when the signature is invalid (enhancing detectability) via a novel rank-based sampling strategy. Compared to conventional watermark detectors that only output binary results, Bileve can differentiate 5 scenarios during detection, reliably tracing text provenance and regulating LLMs. The experiments conducted on OPT-1.3B and LLaMA-7B demonstrate the effectiveness of Bileve in defeating spoofing attacks with enhanced detectability.

      <title>Deep Bayesian Active Learning for Preference Modeling in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging human preferences for steering the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated notable success in recent years. Nonetheless, data selection and labeling are still a bottleneck for these systems, particularly at large scale. Hence, selecting the most informative points for acquiring human feedback may considerably reduce the cost of preference labeling and unleash the further development of LLMs. Bayesian Active Learning provides a principled framework for addressing this challenge and has demonstrated remarkable success in diverse settings. However, previous attempts to employ it for Preference Modeling did not meet such expectations. In this work, we identify that naive epistemic uncertainty estimation leads to the acquisition of redundant samples. We address this by proposing the Bayesian Active Learner for Preference Modeling (BAL-PM), a novel stochastic acquisition policy that not only targets points of high epistemic uncertainty according to the preference model but also seeks to maximize the entropy of the acquired prompt distribution in the feature space spanned by the employed LLM. Notably, our experiments demonstrate that BAL-PM requires 33% to 68% fewer preference labels in two popular human preference datasets and exceeds previous stochastic Bayesian acquisition policies.</description>

      <title>Jump Starting Bandits with LLM-Generated Prior Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present substantial evidence demonstrating the benefits of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit framework. Contextual bandits have been widely used in recommendation systems to generate personalized suggestions based on user-specific contexts. We show that LLMs, pre-trained on extensive corpora rich in human knowledge and preferences, can simulate human behaviours well enough to jump-start contextual multi-armed bandits to reduce online learning regret. We propose an initialization algorithm for contextual bandits by prompting LLMs to produce a pre-training dataset of approximate human preferences for the bandit. This significantly reduces online learning regret and data-gathering costs for training such models. Our approach is validated empirically through two sets of experiments with different bandit setups: one which utilizes LLMs to serve as an oracle and a real-world experiment utilizing data from a conjoint survey experiment.</description>

      <title>Agentless: Demystifying LLM-based Software Engineering Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the automation of software development tasks, including code synthesis, program repair, and test generation. More recently, researchers and industry practitioners have developed various autonomous LLM agents to perform end-to-end software development tasks. These agents are equipped with the ability to use tools, run commands, observe feedback from the environment, and plan for future actions. However, the complexity of these agent-based approaches, together with the limited abilities of current LLMs, raises the following question: Do we really have to employ complex autonomous software agents? To attempt to answer this question, we build Agentless -- an agentless approach to automatically solve software development problems. Compared to the verbose and complex setup of agent-based approaches, Agentless employs a simplistic three-phase process of localization, repair, and patch validation, without letting the LLM decide future actions or operate with complex tools. Our results on the popular SWE-bench Lite benchmark show that surprisingly the simplistic Agentless is able to achieve both the highest performance (32.00%, 96 correct fixes) and low cost ($0.70) compared with all existing open-source software agents! Furthermore, we manually classified the problems in SWE-bench Lite and found problems with exact ground truth patch or insufficient/misleading issue descriptions. As such, we construct SWE-bench Lite-S by excluding such problematic issues to perform more rigorous evaluation and comparison. Our work highlights the current overlooked potential of a simple, interpretable technique in autonomous software development. We hope Agentless will help reset the baseline, starting point, and horizon for autonomous software agents, and inspire future work along this crucial direction.</description>

      <title>INDICT: Code Generation with Internal Dialogues of Critiques for Both Security and Helpfulness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code are typically trained to align with natural language instructions to closely follow their intentions and requirements. However, in many practical scenarios, it becomes increasingly challenging for these models to navigate the intricate boundary between helpfulness and safety, especially against highly complex yet potentially malicious instructions. In this work, we introduce INDICT: a new framework that empowers LLMs with Internal Dialogues of Critiques for both safety and helpfulness guidance. The internal dialogue is a dual cooperative system between a safety-driven critic and a helpfulness-driven critic. Each critic provides analysis against the given task and corresponding generated response, equipped with external knowledge queried through relevant code snippets and tools like web search and code interpreter. We engage the dual critic system in both code generation stage as well as code execution stage, providing preemptive and post-hoc guidance respectively to LLMs. We evaluated INDICT on 8 diverse tasks across 8 programming languages from 5 benchmarks, using LLMs from 7B to 70B parameters. We observed that our approach can provide an advanced level of critiques of both safety and helpfulness analysis, significantly improving the quality of output codes ($+10\%$ absolute improvements in all models).</description>

      <title>Waterfall: Framework for Robust and Scalable Text Watermarking and Provenance for LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protecting intellectual property (IP) of text such as articles and code is increasingly important, especially as sophisticated attacks become possible, such as paraphrasing by large language models (LLMs) or even unauthorized training of LLMs on copyrighted text to infringe such IP. However, existing text watermarking methods are not robust enough against such attacks nor scalable to millions of users for practical implementation. In this paper, we propose Waterfall, the first training-free framework for robust and scalable text watermarking applicable across multiple text types (e.g., articles, code) and languages supportable by LLMs, for general text and LLM data provenance. Waterfall comprises several key innovations, such as being the first to use LLM as paraphrasers for watermarking along with a novel combination of techniques that are surprisingly effective in achieving robust verifiability and scalability. We empirically demonstrate that Waterfall achieves significantly better scalability, robust verifiability, and computational efficiency compared to SOTA article-text watermarking methods, and showed how it could be directly applied to the watermarking of code. We also demonstrated that Waterfall can be used for LLM data provenance, where the watermarks of LLM training data can be detected in LLM output, allowing for detection of unauthorized use of data for LLM training and potentially enabling model-centric watermarking of open-sourced LLMs which has been a limitation of existing LLM watermarking works. Our code is available at https://github.com/aoi3142/Waterfall.</description>

      <title>GLBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Graph with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07457v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the way we interact with graphs, leading to a new paradigm called GraphLLM. Despite the rapid development of GraphLLM methods in recent years, the progress and understanding of this field remain unclear due to the lack of a benchmark with consistent experimental protocols. To bridge this gap, we introduce GLBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GraphLLM methods in both supervised and zero-shot scenarios. GLBench provides a fair and thorough evaluation of different categories of GraphLLM methods, along with traditional baselines such as graph neural networks. Through extensive experiments on a collection of real-world datasets with consistent data processing and splitting strategies, we have uncovered several key findings. Firstly, GraphLLM methods outperform traditional baselines in supervised settings, with LLM-as-enhancers showing the most robust performance. However, using LLMs as predictors is less effective and often leads to uncontrollable output issues. We also notice that no clear scaling laws exist for current GraphLLM methods. In addition, both structures and semantics are crucial for effective zero-shot transfer, and our proposed simple baseline can even outperform several models tailored for zero-shot scenarios. The data and code of the benchmark can be found at https://github.com/NineAbyss/GLBench.</description>

      <title>EMOVA: Empowering Language Models to See, Hear and Speak with Vivid Emotions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GPT-4o, an omni-modal model that enables vocal conversations with diverse emotions and tones, marks a milestone for omni-modal foundation models. However, empowering Large Language Models to perceive and generate images, texts, and speeches end-to-end with publicly available data remains challenging in the open-source community. Existing vision-language models rely on external tools for the speech processing, while speech-language models still suffer from limited or even without vision-understanding abilities. To address this gap, we propose EMOVA (EMotionally Omni-present Voice Assistant), to enable Large Language Models with end-to-end speech capabilities while maintaining the leading vision-language performance. With a semantic-acoustic disentangled speech tokenizer, we notice surprisingly that omni-modal alignment can further enhance vision-language and speech abilities compared with the corresponding bi-modal aligned counterparts. Moreover, a lightweight style module is proposed for flexible speech style controls (e.g., emotions and pitches). For the first time, EMOVA achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the vision-language and speech benchmarks, and meanwhile, supporting omni-modal spoken dialogue with vivid emotions.</description>

      <title>Sparse Attention Decomposition Applied to Circuit Tracing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many papers have shown that attention heads work in conjunction with each other to perform complex tasks. It's frequently assumed that communication between attention heads is via the addition of specific features to token residuals. In this work we seek to isolate and identify the features used to effect communication and coordination among attention heads in GPT-2 small. Our key leverage on the problem is to show that these features are very often sparsely coded in the singular vectors of attention head matrices. We characterize the dimensionality and occurrence of these signals across the attention heads in GPT-2 small when used for the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. The sparse encoding of signals, as provided by attention head singular vectors, allows for efficient separation of signals from the residual background and straightforward identification of communication paths between attention heads. We explore the effectiveness of this approach by tracing portions of the circuits used in the IOI task. Our traces reveal considerable detail not present in previous studies, shedding light on the nature of redundant paths present in GPT-2. And our traces go beyond previous work by identifying features used to communicate between attention heads when performing IOI.</description>

      <title>AIME: AI System Optimization via Multiple LLM Evaluators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-based AI system optimization typically involves a feedback loop scheme where a single LLM generates an evaluation in natural language of the current output to improve the next iteration's output. However, in this work, we empirically demonstrate that for a practical and complex task (code generation) with multiple criteria to evaluate, utilizing only one LLM evaluator tends to let errors in generated code go undetected, thus leading to incorrect evaluations and ultimately suboptimal test case performance. Motivated by this failure case, we assume there exists an optimal evaluation policy that samples an evaluation between response and ground truth. We then theoretically prove that a linear combination of multiple evaluators can approximate this optimal policy. From this insight, we propose AI system optimization via Multiple LLM Evaluators (AIME). AIME is an evaluation protocol that utilizes multiple LLMs that each independently generate an evaluation on separate criteria and then combine them via concatenation. We provide an extensive empirical study showing AIME outperforming baseline methods in code generation tasks, with up to $62\%$ higher error detection rate and up to $16\%$ higher success rate than a single LLM evaluation protocol on LeetCodeHard and HumanEval datasets. We also show that the selection of the number of evaluators and which criteria to utilize is non-trivial as it can impact pact success rate by up to $12\%$.</description>

      <title>Variational Language Concepts for Interpreting Foundation Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation Language Models (FLMs) such as BERT and its variants have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing. To date, the interpretability of FLMs has primarily relied on the attention weights in their self-attention layers. However, these attention weights only provide word-level interpretations, failing to capture higher-level structures, and are therefore lacking in readability and intuitiveness. To address this challenge, we first provide a formal definition of conceptual interpretation and then propose a variational Bayesian framework, dubbed VAriational Language Concept (VALC), to go beyond word-level interpretations and provide concept-level interpretations. Our theoretical analysis shows that our VALC finds the optimal language concepts to interpret FLM predictions. Empirical results on several real-world datasets show that our method can successfully provide conceptual interpretation for FLMs.</description>

      <title>Understanding Warmup-Stable-Decay Learning Rates: A River Valley Loss Landscape Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training language models currently requires pre-determining a fixed compute budget because the typical cosine learning rate schedule depends on the total number of steps. In contrast, the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) schedule uses a constant learning rate to produce a main branch of iterates that can in principle continue indefinitely without a pre-specified compute budget. Then, given any compute budget, one can branch out from the main branch at a proper at any time with a rapidly decaying learning rate to produce a strong model. Empirically, WSD generates a non-traditional loss curve: the loss remains elevated during the stable phase but sharply declines during the decay phase. Towards explaining this phenomenon, we conjecture that pretraining loss exhibits a river valley landscape, which resembles a deep valley with a river at its bottom. Under this assumption, we show that during the stable phase, the iterate undergoes large oscillations due to the high learning rate, yet it progresses swiftly along the river. During the decay phase, the rapidly dropping learning rate minimizes the iterate's oscillations, moving it closer to the river and revealing true optimization progress. Therefore, the sustained high learning rate phase and fast decaying phase are responsible for progress in the river and the mountain directions respectively, and are both critical. Our analysis predicts phenomenons consistent with empirical observations and shows that this landscape can emerge from pretraining on a simple bi-gram dataset. Inspired by the theory, we introduce WSD-S, a variant of WSD that reuses previous checkpoints' decay phases and keeps only one main branch, where we resume from a decayed checkpoint. WSD-S empirically outperforms WSD and Cyclic-Cosine in obtaining multiple language model checkpoints across various compute budgets in a single run for parameters scaling from 0.1B to 1.2B.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the question of how to successively add new knowledge to an LLM whilst retaining previously-added knowledge. We consider two settings, semi-cooperative and fully-cooperative. Overall, LoRA performs better in most cases than full-fine tuning of all parameters when both new knowledge acquisition and retention of old, including recent, knowledge are taken into account. In the semi-cooperative setting, where datasets are not available after training, MOE mixing, model merging, and LoRA-based orthogonal subspace sequential learning, using a small weight on the orthogonality term, perform well. In the fully-cooperative setting where datasets remain available, joint training and sequential training with replay are both effective approaches with LoRA training generally preferable to full fine-tuning. The codes needed to reproduce the results are provided in an open source repository.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Forgetting in LLM Supervised Fine-Tuning and Preference Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-training of pre-trained LLMs, which typically consists of the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage and the preference learning (RLHF or DPO) stage, is crucial to effective and safe LLM applications. The widely adopted approach in post-training popular open-source LLMs is to sequentially perform SFT and RLHF/DPO. However, sequential training is sub-optimal in terms of SFT and RLHF/DPO trade-off: the LLM gradually forgets about the first stage's training when undergoing the second stage's training. We theoretically prove the sub-optimality of sequential post-training. Furthermore, we propose a practical joint post-training framework with theoretical convergence guarantees and empirically outperforms sequential post-training framework, while having similar computational cost.

Abstract: Data science tasks involving tabular data present complex challenges that require sophisticated problem-solving approaches. We propose AutoKaggle, a powerful and user-centric framework that assists data scientists in completing daily data pipelines through a collaborative multi-agent system. AutoKaggle implements an iterative development process that combines code execution, debugging, and comprehensive unit testing to ensure code correctness and logic consistency. The framework offers highly customizable workflows, allowing users to intervene at each phase, thus integrating automated intelligence with human expertise. Our universal data science toolkit, comprising validated functions for data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling, forms the foundation of this solution, enhancing productivity by streamlining common tasks. We selected 8 Kaggle competitions to simulate data processing workflows in real-world application scenarios. Evaluation results demonstrate that AutoKaggle achieves a validation submission rate of 0.85 and a comprehensive score of 0.82 in typical data science pipelines, fully proving its effectiveness and practicality in handling complex data science tasks.</description>

      <title>Document Parsing Unveiled: Techniques, Challenges, and Prospects for Structured Information Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21169</link>

Abstract: Document parsing is essential for converting unstructured and semi-structured documents-such as contracts, academic papers, and invoices-into structured, machine-readable data. Document parsing extract reliable structured data from unstructured inputs, providing huge convenience for numerous applications. Especially with recent achievements in Large Language Models, document parsing plays an indispensable role in both knowledge base construction and training data generation. This survey presents a comprehensive review of the current state of document parsing, covering key methodologies, from modular pipeline systems to end-to-end models driven by large vision-language models. Core components such as layout detection, content extraction (including text, tables, and mathematical expressions), and multi-modal data integration are examined in detail. Additionally, this paper discusses the challenges faced by modular document parsing systems and vision-language models in handling complex layouts, integrating multiple modules, and recognizing high-density text. It emphasizes the importance of developing larger and more diverse datasets and outlines future research directions.</description>
