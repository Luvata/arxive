      <title>AI Agents for the Dhumbal Card Game: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents for Dhumbal, a culturally significant multiplayer card game with imperfect information, through a systematic comparison of rule-based, search-based, and learning-based strategies. We formalize Dhumbal's mechanics and implement diverse agents, including heuristic approaches (Aggressive, Conservative, Balanced, Opportunistic), search-based methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (ISMCTS), and reinforcement learning approaches including Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and a random baseline. Evaluation involves within-category tournaments followed by a cross-category championship. Performance is measured via win rate, economic outcome, Jhyap success, cards discarded per round, risk assessment, and decision efficiency. Statistical significance is assessed using Welch's t-test with Bonferroni correction, effect sizes via Cohen's d, and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Across 1024 simulated rounds, the rule-based Aggressive agent achieves the highest win rate (88.3%, 95% CI: [86.3, 90.3]), outperforming ISMCTS (9.0%) and PPO (1.5%) through effective exploitation of Jhyap declarations. The study contributes a reproducible AI framework, insights into heuristic efficacy under partial information, and open-source code, thereby advancing AI research and supporting digital preservation of cultural games.</description>

      <title>Beyond Consensus: Mitigating the Agreeableness Bias in LLM Judge Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New Large Language Models (LLMs) become available every few weeks, and modern application developers confronted with the unenviable task of having to decide if they should switch to a new model. While human evaluation remains the gold standard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use LLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw: LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that while LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive Rate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True Negative Rate &lt;25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often leads to inflated reliability scores.
  While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they are not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. For scenarios requiring even higher precision, we propose a novel regression-based framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of human-annotated ground truth data. On a challenging code feedback task over 366 high-school Python programs, our regression approach reduces the maximum absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.</description>

      <title>Holistic Agent Leaderboard: The Missing Infrastructure for AI Agent Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second, we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across 9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real world.</description>

      <title>CGBench: Benchmarking Language Model Scientific Reasoning for Clinical Genetics Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variant and gene interpretation are fundamental to personalized medicine and translational biomedicine. However, traditional approaches are manual and labor-intensive. Generative language models (LMs) can facilitate this process, accelerating the translation of fundamental research into clinically-actionable insights. While existing benchmarks have attempted to quantify the capabilities of LMs for interpreting scientific data, these studies focus on narrow tasks that do not translate to real-world research. To meet these challenges, we introduce CGBench, a robust benchmark that tests reasoning capabilities of LMs on scientific publications. CGBench is built from ClinGen, a resource of expert-curated literature interpretations in clinical genetics. CGBench measures the ability to 1) extract relevant experimental results following precise protocols and guidelines, 2) judge the strength of evidence, and 3) categorize and describe the relevant outcome of experiments. We test 8 different LMs and find that while models show promise, substantial gaps exist in literature interpretation, especially on fine-grained instructions. Reasoning models excel in fine-grained tasks but non-reasoning models are better at high-level interpretations. Finally, we measure LM explanations against human explanations with an LM judge approach, revealing that models often hallucinate or misinterpret results even when correctly classifying evidence. CGBench reveals strengths and weaknesses of LMs for precise interpretation of scientific publications, opening avenues for future research in AI for clinical genetics and science more broadly.</description>

      <title>Asking Clarifying Questions for Preference Elicitation With Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it possible for recommendation systems to interact with users in open-ended conversational interfaces. In order to personalize LLM responses, it is crucial to elicit user preferences, especially when there is limited user history. One way to get more information is to present clarifying questions to the user. However, generating effective sequential clarifying questions across various domains remains a challenge. To address this, we introduce a novel approach for training LLMs to ask sequential questions that reveal user preferences. Our method follows a two-stage process inspired by diffusion models. Starting from a user profile, the forward process generates clarifying questions to obtain answers and then removes those answers step by step, serving as a way to add ``noise'' to the user profile. The reverse process involves training a model to ``denoise'' the user profile by learning to ask effective clarifying questions. Our results show that our method significantly improves the LLM's proficiency in asking funnel questions and eliciting user preferences effectively.</description>

      <title>CausalTrace: A Neurosymbolic Causal Analysis Agent for Smart Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern manufacturing environments demand not only accurate predictions but also interpretable insights to process anomalies, root causes, and potential interventions. Existing AI systems often function as isolated black boxes, lacking the seamless integration of prediction, explanation, and causal reasoning required for a unified decision-support solution. This fragmentation limits their trustworthiness and practical utility in high-stakes industrial environments. In this work, we present CausalTrace, a neurosymbolic causal analysis module integrated into the SmartPilot industrial CoPilot. CausalTrace performs data-driven causal analysis enriched by industrial ontologies and knowledge graphs, including advanced functions such as causal discovery, counterfactual reasoning, and root cause analysis (RCA). It supports real-time operator interaction and is designed to complement existing agents by offering transparent, explainable decision support. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of CausalTrace using multiple causal assessment methods and the C3AN framework (i.e. Custom, Compact, Composite AI with Neurosymbolic Integration), which spans principles of robustness, intelligence, and trustworthiness. In an academic rocket assembly testbed, CausalTrace achieved substantial agreement with domain experts (ROUGE-1: 0.91 in ontology QA) and strong RCA performance (MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92). It also attained 4.59/5 in the C3AN evaluation, demonstrating precision and reliability for live deployment.</description>

      <title>Do Large Language Models Respect Contracts? Evaluating and Enforcing Contract-Adherence in Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prevailing code generation benchmarks, such as HumanEval+ and MBPP+, primarily evaluate large language models (LLMs) with pass@k on functional correctness using well-formed inputs. However, they ignore a crucial aspect of real-world software: adherence to contracts-the preconditions and validity constraints that dictate how ill-formed inputs must be rejected. This critical oversight means that existing benchmarks fail to measure, and models consequently fail to generate, truly robust and reliable code snippets. We introduce PACT, a program assessment and contract-adherence evaluation framework, to bridge this gap. PACT is the first framework designed to systematically evaluate and enhance contract-adherence in LLM-generated code snippets alongside functional correctness. PACT's contributions are threefold: First, it provides a comprehensive test-suite corpus focused on contract violations, extending HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Second, it enables a systematic analysis of code generation under varied prompting conditions. This analysis demonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases significantly enhance a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using contract description alone. Finally, it introduces novel metrics to rigorously quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation. By revealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook, PACT provides the rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of LLM-generated code snippets in both functionality and contract-adherence.Our code and data are available at https://github.com/suhanmen/PACT.</description>

      <title>Empowering LLM Agents with Geospatial Awareness: Toward Grounded Reasoning for Wildfire Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective disaster response is essential for safeguarding lives and property. Existing statistical approaches often lack semantic context, generalize poorly across events, and offer limited interpretability. While Large language models (LLMs) provide few-shot generalization, they remain text-bound and blind to geography. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL) that grounds LLM agents in structured earth data. Starting from raw wildfire detections, GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure, demographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases, assembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched context enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation recommendations (e.g., personnel assignments, budget allocations), further reinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental updates. We evaluate the framework in real wildfire scenarios across multiple LLM models, showing that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines. The proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and hurricanes.</description>

      <title>ThinkPilot: Steering Reasoning Models via Automated Think-prefixes Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are powerful, but they still suffer from inefficient and off-target reasoning. Currently, training-free methods are limited to either rigid heuristics or descriptive, non-actionable analyses. In this paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that automatically optimizes LRMs reasoning. It uses an evolutionary process to generate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it significantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning, drastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction following. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our analysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning behaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific behavioral distributions. By automatically identifying and eliciting these behaviors, ThinkPilot provides a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs reasoning with task demands.

      <title>AI Agents as Universal Task Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI reasoning agents are already able to solve a variety of tasks by deploying tools, simulating outcomes of multiple hypotheses and reflecting on them. In doing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense -- there is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI agents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task? How does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training dataset size?
  In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI Agents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and highlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason. In doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to transductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the distribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce the time needed to find solutions to new tasks.
  Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role of information in learning is about reduction of time rather than reconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a universal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their algorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the observed power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show that scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on benchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone super-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can behave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight. Instead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning models is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly considered.</description>

      <title>HiCoTraj:Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring demographic attributes such as age, sex, or income level from human mobility patterns enables critical applications such as targeted public health interventions, equitable urban planning, and personalized transportation services. Existing mobility-based demographic inference studies heavily rely on large-scale trajectory data with demographic labels, leading to limited interpretability and poor generalizability across different datasets and user groups. We propose HiCoTraj (Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory), a framework that leverages LLMs' zero-shot learning and semantic understanding capabilities to perform demographic inference without labeled training data. HiCoTraj transforms trajectories into semantically rich, natural language representations by creating detailed activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. Then HiCoTraj uses a novel hierarchical chain of thought reasoning to systematically guide LLMs through three cognitive stages: factual feature extraction, behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output. This approach addresses the scarcity challenge of labeled demographic data while providing transparent reasoning chains. Experimental evaluation on real-world trajectory data demonstrates that HiCoTraj achieves competitive performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios.</description>

      <title>EmboMatrix: A Scalable Training-Ground for Embodied Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied decision-making enables agents to translate high-level goals into executable actions through continuous interactions within the physical world, forming a cornerstone of general-purpose embodied intelligence. Large language models (LLMs), with their general decision-making capabilities, offer a promising path to realize this potential; however, LLMs trained solely on language lack exposure to physical environments, limiting their true embodied understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose the concept of a training ground: a comprehensive infrastructure that provides task and scene simulation, embodied interaction, and feedback signals, offering a one-stop solution for LLM acquire genuine embodied decision-making skills. In this work, we present EmboMatrix, the first training ground of its kind, providing massive and diverse tasks with efficient simulation and precise rewards. EmboMatrix incorporates a series of novel techniques: a multi-agent data engine for large-scale task and scene generation, a distributed heterogeneous-hardware system for scalable simulation, and a multi-level reward architecture for precise supervision. Leveraging EmboMatrix, we cultivate EmboBrain, an LLM whose embodied decision-making abilities emerge from extensive embodied interactions. Experiments show that EmboBrain-7B surpasses the 671B DeepSeek-R1 baseline by 9.5\% on two challenging embodied decision-making benchmarks, demonstrating the power of interactive, environment-grounded learning for building truly intelligent embodied agents.</description>

      <title>BeSTAD: Behavior-Aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human Mobility Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional anomaly detection in human mobility has primarily focused on trajectory-level analysis, identifying statistical outliers or spatiotemporal inconsistencies across aggregated movement traces. However, detecting individual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility behavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets encompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human Mobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized behavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained anomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD learns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location meaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in individual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware modeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal activity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison with consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior clustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts and deviations from established routines but also the identification of individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets. By learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Quality of Randomness and Entropy in Tasks Supported by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) technology has led to diverse applications, many of which inherently require randomness, such as stochastic decision-making, gaming, scheduling, AI agents, and cryptography-related tasks. However, the capabilities of LLMs in handling randomness, particularly in generating and utilizing random numbers effectively, remain unclear. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs for handling tasks that involve randomness through a series of experiments. We designed a set of experiments that consider various factors that can influence an LLM's performance in tasks involving randomness, such as accessibility to external tools, types of tasks, model states (fresh vs. non-fresh), and prompting strategies. The experiments cover a range of tasks, including generating random numbers, generating random strings such as passwords, shuffling items, and evaluating the quality of randomness using entropy and the NIST randomness test-suite. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate outputs that exhibit some degree of randomness, their performance is inconsistent and often deviates significantly from the expected behavior. The analysis of the experimental results highlights key limitations and areas where improvement is needed for the LLMs to effectively handle tasks involving randomness</description>

      <title>One Life to Learn: Inferring Symbolic World Models for Stochastic Environments from Unguided Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic world modeling requires inferring and representing an environment's transitional dynamics as an executable program. Prior work has focused on largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only "one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure, activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex, hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO, our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured, object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23 scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown, complex environments.</description>

      <title>ToPolyAgent: AI Agents for Coarse-Grained Topological Polymer Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ToPolyAgent, a multi-agent AI framework for performing coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of topological polymers through natural language instructions. By integrating large language models (LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both interactive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer architectures, including linear, ring, brush, and star polymers, as well as dendrimers. The system consists of four LLM-powered agents: a Config Agent for generating initial polymer-solvent configurations, a Simulation Agent for executing LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report Agent for compiling markdown reports, and a Workflow Agent for streamlined autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution from detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case studies involving diverse polymer architectures under varying solvent condition, thermostats, and simulation lengths. Furthermore, we highlight its potential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers barriers to complex computational workflows and advances AI-driven materials discovery in polymer science. It lays the foundation for autonomous and extensible multi-agent scientific research ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Precise Attribute Intensity Control in Large Language Models via Targeted Representation Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM) outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods, however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks: preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference.

      <title>MatSciBench: Benchmarking the Reasoning Ability of Large Language Models in Materials Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in scientific reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in materials science remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce MatSciBench, a comprehensive college-level benchmark comprising 1,340 problems that span the essential subdisciplines of materials science. MatSciBench features a structured and fine-grained taxonomy that categorizes materials science questions into 6 primary fields and 31 sub-fields, and includes a three-tier difficulty classification based on the reasoning length required to solve each question. MatSciBench provides detailed reference solutions enabling precise error analysis and incorporates multimodal reasoning through visual contexts in numerous questions. Evaluations of leading models reveal that even the highest-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves under 80% accuracy on college-level materials science questions, highlighting the complexity of MatSciBench. Our systematic analysis of different reasoning strategie--basic chain-of-thought, tool augmentation, and self-correction--demonstrates that no single method consistently excels across all scenarios. We further analyze performance by difficulty level, examine trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, highlight the challenges inherent in multimodal reasoning tasks, analyze failure modes across LLMs and reasoning methods, and evaluate the influence of retrieval-augmented generation. MatSciBench thus establishes a comprehensive and solid benchmark for assessing and driving improvements in the scientific reasoning capabilities of LLMs within the materials science domain.</description>

      <title>Evolution of meta's llama models and parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review surveys the rapid evolution of Meta AI's LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) series - from LLaMA 1 through LLaMA 4 and the specialized parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods developed for these models. We first describe the LLaMA family of foundation models (7B-65B to 288B parameters), their architectures (including native multimodal and Mixtureof-Experts variants), and key performance characteristics. We then describe and discuss the concept of PEFT, which adapts large pre-trained models by updating only a small subset of parameters, and review five PEFT methods that have been applied to LLaMA: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), LLaMA-Adapter V1 and V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). We discuss each method's mechanism, parameter savings, and example application to LLaMA (e.g., instruction tuning, multimodal tasks). We provide structured discussion and analysis of model and adapter architectures, parameter counts, and benchmark results (including examples where fine-tuned LLaMA models outperform larger baselines). Finally, we examine real-world use cases where LLaMA-based models and PEFT have been successfully applied (e.g., legal and medical domains), and we discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions (such as scaling to even larger contexts and improving robustness). This survey paper provides a one-stop resource for ML researchers and practitioners interested in LLaMA models and efficient fine-tuning strategies.</description>

      <title>ResearStudio: A Human-Intervenable Framework for Building Controllable Deep-Research Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current deep-research agents run in a ''fire-and-forget'' mode: once started, they give users no way to fix errors or add expert knowledge during execution. We present ResearStudio, the first open-source framework that places real-time human control at its core. The system follows a Collaborative Workshop design. A hierarchical Planner-Executor writes every step to a live ''plan-as-document,'' a fast communication layer streams each action, file change, and tool call to a web interface. At any moment, the user can pause the run, edit the plan or code, run custom commands, and resume -- switching smoothly between AI-led, human-assisted and human-led, AI-assisted modes. In fully autonomous mode, ResearStudio achieves state-of-the-art results on the GAIA benchmark, surpassing systems like OpenAI's DeepResearch and Manus. These results show that strong automated performance and fine-grained human control can coexist. The full code, protocol, and evaluation scripts are available at https://github.com/ResearAI/ResearStudio. We will continue to update the repository to encourage further work on safe and controllable research agents. Our live demo is publicly accessible at http://ai-researcher.net:3000/. We support the development of DeepScientist, which can be accessed at https://github.com/ResearAI/DeepScientist.</description>

      <title>On the Design and Evaluation of Human-centered Explainable AI Systems: A Systematic Review and Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI becomes more common in everyday living, there is an increasing demand for intelligent systems that are both performant and understandable. Explainable AI (XAI) systems aim to provide comprehensible explanations of decisions and predictions. At present, however, evaluation processes are rather technical and not sufficiently focused on the needs of human users. Consequently, evaluation studies involving human users can serve as a valuable guide for conducting user studies. This paper presents a comprehensive review of 65 user studies evaluating XAI systems across different domains and application contexts. As a guideline for XAI developers, we provide a holistic overview of the properties of XAI systems and evaluation metrics focused on human users (human-centered). We propose objectives for the human-centered design (design goals) of XAI systems. To incorporate users' specific characteristics, design goals are adapted to users with different levels of AI expertise (AI novices and data experts). In this regard, we provide an extension to existing XAI evaluation and design frameworks. The first part of our results includes the analysis of XAI system characteristics. An important finding is the distinction between the core system and the XAI explanation, which together form the whole system. Further results include the distinction of evaluation metrics into affection towards the system, cognition, usability, interpretability, and explanation metrics. Furthermore, the users, along with their specific characteristics and behavior, can be assessed. For AI novices, the relevant extended design goals include responsible use, acceptance, and usability. For data experts, the focus is performance-oriented and includes human-AI collaboration and system and user task performance.</description>

      <title>GOAT: A Training Framework for Goal-Oriented Agent with Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been extended beyond traditional text generation to serve as interactive agents capable of using external tools based on user intent. However, current LLM agents still show limited ability to handle goal-oriented queries, which require decomposing a high-level objective into multiple interdependent API calls with correct planning and execution. Current approaches mainly rely on zero-shot evaluation due to the absence of training data. While proprietary closed-source models such as GPT-4 demonstrate strong reasoning abilities, smaller open-source models struggle to perform complex tool use effectively. Thus, we propose a novel training framework GOAT, which enables fine-tuning of LLM agents in a human annotation-free setting. GOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets of goal-oriented API execution tasks directly from given API documents, equipping models with the ability to reason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses. Through extensive experiments, we show that GOAT-trained agents achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple existing goal-oriented benchmarks. In addition, we introduce GOATBench, a new goal-oriented API execution benchmark, and demonstrate that agents trained with GOAT also excel in this setting. These results highlight GOAT as a practical path toward building robust open-source LLM agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use.</description>

      <title>MedKGEval: A Knowledge Graph-Based Multi-Turn Evaluation Framework for Open-Ended Patient Interactions with Clinical LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliable evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in medical applications remains an open challenge, particularly in capturing the complexity of multi-turn doctor-patient interactions that unfold in real clinical environments. Existing evaluation methods typically rely on post hoc review of full conversation transcripts, thereby neglecting the dynamic, context-sensitive nature of medical dialogues and the evolving informational needs of patients. In this work, we present MedKGEval, a novel multi-turn evaluation framework for clinical LLMs grounded in structured medical knowledge. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a knowledge graph-driven patient simulation mechanism, where a dedicated control module retrieves relevant medical facts from a curated knowledge graph, thereby endowing the patient agent with human-like and realistic conversational behavior. This knowledge graph is constructed by integrating open-source resources with additional triples extracted from expert-annotated datasets; (2) an in-situ, turn-level evaluation framework, where each model response is assessed by a Judge Agent for clinical appropriateness, factual correctness, and safety as the dialogue progresses using a suite of fine-grained, task-specific metrics; (3) a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark of eight state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating MedKGEval's ability to identify subtle behavioral flaws and safety risks that are often overlooked by conventional evaluation pipelines. Although initially designed for Chinese and English medical applications, our framework can be readily extended to additional languages by switching the input knowledge graphs, ensuring seamless bilingual support and domain-specific applicability.</description>

      <title>PromptFlow: Training Prompts Like Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated profound impact on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, their effective deployment across diverse domains often require domain-specific adaptation strategies, as generic models may underperform when faced with specialized data distributions. Recent advances in prompt engineering (PE) offer a promising alternative to extensive retraining by refining input instructions to align LLM outputs with task objectives. This paradigm has emerged as a rapid and versatile approach for model fine-tuning. Despite its potential, manual prompt design remains labor-intensive and heavily depends on specialized expertise, often requiring iterative human effort to achieve optimal formulations. To address this limitation, automated prompt engineering methodologies have been developed to systematically generate task-specific prompts. However, current implementations predominantly employ static update rules and lack mechanisms for dynamic strategy selection, resulting in suboptimal adaptation to varying NLP task requirements. Furthermore, most methods treat and update the whole prompts at each step, without considering editing prompt sections at a finer granularity. At last, in particular, the problem of how to recycle experience in LLM is still underexplored. To this end, we propose the PromptFlow, a modular training framework inspired by TensorFlow, which integrates meta-prompts, operators, optimization, and evaluator. Our framework can be equipped with the latest optimization methods and autonomously explores optimal prompt refinement trajectories through gradient-based meta-learning, requiring minimal task-specific training data. Specifically, we devise a reinforcement learning method to recycle experience for LLM in the PE process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on various datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of PromptFlow.</description>

      <title>$\mathbf{T^3}$: Reducing Belief Deviation in Reinforcement Learning for Active Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active reasoning requires large language models (LLMs) to interact with external sources and strategically gather information to solve problems. Central to this process is belief tracking: maintaining a coherent understanding of the problem state and the missing information toward the solution. However, due to limited reasoning capabilities, LLM-based agents often suffer from belief deviation: they struggle to correctly model beliefs, lose track of problem states, and fall into uninformative or repetitive actions. Once this happens, errors compound and reinforcement learning (RL) training fails to properly credit the crucial exploratory steps. To address this issue, we propose to track the deviation of model beliefs and develop $\mathbf{T^3}$, a simple yet effective method that detects excessive belief deviation and truncates trajectories during training to remove uninformative tails. By preserving credit for informative prefixes, $\mathbf{T^3}$ systematically improves policy optimization. Across 5 challenging tasks, $\mathbf{T^3}$ consistently enhances training stability, token efficiency, and final performance, achieving up to 30% gains while cutting rollout tokens by roughly 25%. These results highlight belief control as a key principle for developing robust and generalizable LLM-based active reasoners.</description>

      <title>Tensor Logic: The Language of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python, which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation, based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible, such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.</description>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations. However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural fragmentation that constrains current systems.

      <title>O-Forge: An LLM + Computer Algebra Framework for Asymptotic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated advanced capabilities in solving IMO and Putnam problems; yet their role in research mathematics has remained fairly limited. The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs may look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking. We present a framework, called LLM+CAS, and an associated tool, O-Forge, that couples frontier LLMs with a computer algebra systems (CAS) in an In-Context Symbolic Feedback loop to produce proofs that are both creative and symbolically verified. Our focus is on asymptotic inequalities, a topic that often involves difficult proofs and appropriate decomposition of the domain into the "right" subdomains. Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using AI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level asymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns out to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a combination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to suggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a verification of each piece axiomatically. Using this loop, we answer a question posed by Terence Tao: whether LLMs coupled with a verifier can be used to help prove intricate asymptotic inequalities. More broadly, we show how AI can move beyond contest math towards research-level tools for professional mathematicians.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Vibe Coding with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm shift from code generation assistance to autonomous coding agents, enabling a novel development methodology termed "Vibe Coding" where developers validate AI-generated implementations through outcome observation rather than line-by-line code comprehension. Despite its transformative potential, the effectiveness of this emergent paradigm remains under-explored, with empirical evidence revealing unexpected productivity losses and fundamental challenges in human-AI collaboration. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive and systematic review of Vibe Coding with large language models, establishing both theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this transformative development approach. Drawing from systematic analysis of over 1000 research papers, we survey the entire vibe coding ecosystem, examining critical infrastructure components including LLMs for coding, LLM-based coding agent, development environment of coding agent, and feedback mechanisms. We first introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a Constrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic relationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing practices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation, Iterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and Context-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in this domain. Critically, our analysis reveals that successful Vibe Coding depends not merely on agent capabilities but on systematic context engineering, well-established development environments, and human-agent collaborative development models.</description>

      <title>PricingLogic: Evaluating LLMs Reasoning on Complex Tourism Pricing Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PricingLogic, the first benchmark that probes whether Large Language Models(LLMs) can reliably automate tourism-related prices when multiple, overlapping fare rules apply. Travel agencies are eager to offload this error-prone task onto AI systems; however, deploying LLMs without verified reliability could result in significant financial losses and erode customer trust. PricingLogic comprises 300 natural-language questions based on booking requests derived from 42 real-world pricing policies, spanning two levels of difficulty: (i) basic customer-type pricing and (ii)bundled-tour calculations involving interacting discounts. Evaluations of a line of LLMs reveal a steep performance drop on the harder tier,exposing systematic failures in rule interpretation and arithmetic reasoning.These results highlight that, despite their general capabilities, today's LLMs remain unreliable in revenue-critical applications without further safeguards or domain adaptation. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/PricingLogic.</description>

      <title>MTOS: A LLM-Driven Multi-topic Opinion Simulation Framework for Exploring Echo Chamber Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarization of opinions, information segregation, and cognitive biases on social media have attracted significant academic attention. In real-world networks, information often spans multiple interrelated topics, posing challenges for opinion evolution and highlighting the need for frameworks that simulate interactions among topics. Existing studies based on large language models (LLMs) focus largely on single topics, limiting the capture of cognitive transfer in multi-topic, cross-domain contexts. Traditional numerical models, meanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking interpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple topics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation (MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with LLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory, incorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic topic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable perspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS, varying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to assess features such as group polarization and local consistency. Results show that multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively correlated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit them, and irrelevant topics also mitigate echo chamber effects through resource competition. Compared with numerical models, LLM-based agents realistically simulate dynamic opinion changes, reproduce linguistic features of news texts, and capture complex human reasoning, improving simulation interpretability and system stability.</description>

      <title>Biased-Attention Guided Risk Prediction for Safe Decision-Making at Unsignalized Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving decision-making at unsignalized intersections is highly challenging due to complex dynamic interactions and high conflict risks. To achieve proactive safety control, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) decision-making framework integrated with a biased attention mechanism. The framework is built upon the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. Its core innovation lies in the use of biased attention to construct a traffic risk predictor. This predictor assesses the long-term risk of collision for a vehicle entering the intersection and transforms this risk into a dense reward signal to guide the SAC agent in making safe and efficient driving decisions. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at the intersection, thereby proving the effectiveness of the intelligent decision-making framework in complex scenarios. The code of our work is available at https://github.com/hank111525/SAC-RWB.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Mitigating LLM-as-a-judge Bias in Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to autonomously evaluate the quality of content in communication systems, e.g., to assess responses in telecom customer support chatbots. However, the impartiality of these AI "judges" is not guaranteed, and any biases in their evaluation criteria could skew outcomes and undermine user trust. In this paper, we systematically investigate judgment biases in two LLM-as-a-judge models (i.e., GPT-Judge and JudgeLM) under the point-wise scoring setting, encompassing 11 types of biases that cover both implicit and explicit forms. We observed that state-of-the-art LLM judges demonstrate robustness to biased inputs, generally assigning them lower scores than the corresponding clean samples. Providing a detailed scoring rubric further enhances this robustness. We further found that fine-tuning an LLM on high-scoring yet biased responses can significantly degrade its performance, highlighting the risk of training on biased data. We also discovered that the judged scores correlate with task difficulty: a challenging dataset like GPQA yields lower average scores, whereas an open-ended reasoning dataset (e.g., JudgeLM-val) sees higher average scores. Finally, we proposed four potential mitigation strategies to ensure fair and reliable AI judging in practical communication scenarios.</description>

      <title>Using Medical Algorithms for Task-Oriented Dialogue in LLM-Based Medical Interviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a task-oriented dialogue framework structured as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of medical questions. The system integrates: (1) a systematic pipeline for transforming medical algorithms and guidelines into a clinical question corpus; (2) a cold-start mechanism based on hierarchical clustering to generate efficient initial questioning without prior patient information; (3) an expand-and-prune mechanism enabling adaptive branching and backtracking based on patient responses; (4) a termination logic to ensure interviews end once sufficient information is gathered; and (5) automated synthesis of doctor-friendly structured reports aligned with clinical workflows. Human-computer interaction principles guided the design of both the patient and physician applications. Preliminary evaluation involved five physicians using standardized instruments: NASA-TLX (cognitive workload), the System Usability Scale (SUS), and the Questionnaire for User Interface Satisfaction (QUIS). The patient application achieved low workload scores (NASA-TLX = 15.6), high usability (SUS = 86), and strong satisfaction (QUIS = 8.1/9), with particularly high ratings for ease of learning and interface design. The physician application yielded moderate workload (NASA-TLX = 26) and excellent usability (SUS = 88.5), with satisfaction scores of 8.3/9. Both applications demonstrated effective integration into clinical workflows, reducing cognitive demand and supporting efficient report generation. Limitations included occasional system latency and a small, non-diverse evaluation sample.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Virtual Cells: From Measurements to Decisions across Modality, Scale, Dynamics, and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Virtual Cells (AIVCs) aim to learn executable, decision-relevant models of cell state from multimodal, multiscale measurements. Recent studies have introduced single-cell and spatial foundation models, improved cross-modality alignment, scaled perturbation atlases, and explored pathway-level readouts. Nevertheless, although held-out validation is standard practice, evaluations remain predominantly within single datasets and settings; evidence indicates that transport across laboratories and platforms is often limited, that some data splits are vulnerable to leakage and coverage bias, and that dose, time and combination effects are not yet systematically handled. Cross-scale coupling also remains constrained, as anchors linking molecular, cellular and tissue levels are sparse, and alignment to scientific or clinical readouts varies across studies. We propose a model-agnostic Cell-State Latent (CSL) perspective that organizes learning via an operator grammar: measurement, lift/project for cross-scale coupling, and intervention for dosing and scheduling. This view motivates a decision-aligned evaluation blueprint across modality, scale, context and intervention, and emphasizes function-space readouts such as pathway activity, spatial neighborhoods and clinically relevant endpoints. We recommend operator-aware data design, leakage-resistant partitions, and transparent calibration and reporting to enable reproducible, like-for-like comparisons.</description>

      <title>ProtoSiTex: Learning Semi-Interpretable Prototypes for Multi-label Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surge in user-generated reviews has amplified the need for interpretable models that can provide fine-grained insights. Existing prototype-based models offer intuitive explanations but typically operate at coarse granularity (sentence or document level) and fail to address the multi-label nature of real-world text classification. We propose ProtoSiTex, a semi-interpretable framework designed for fine-grained multi-label text classification. ProtoSiTex employs a dual-phase alternating training strategy: an unsupervised prototype discovery phase that learns semantically coherent and diverse prototypes, and a supervised classification phase that maps these prototypes to class labels. A hierarchical loss function enforces consistency across sub-sentence, sentence, and document levels, enhancing interpretability and alignment. Unlike prior approaches, ProtoSiTex captures overlapping and conflicting semantics using adaptive prototypes and multi-head attention. We also introduce a benchmark dataset of hotel reviews annotated at the sub-sentence level with multiple labels. Experiments on this dataset and two public benchmarks (binary and multi-class) show that ProtoSiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance while delivering faithful, human-aligned explanations, establishing it as a robust solution for semi-interpretable multi-label text classification.</description>

      <title>Inclusive Fitness as a Key Step Towards More Advanced Social Behaviors in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The competitive and cooperative forces of natural selection have driven the evolution of intelligence for millions of years, culminating in nature's vast biodiversity and the complexity of human minds. Inspired by this process, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where each agent is assigned a genotype and where reward functions are modelled after the concept of inclusive fitness. An agent's genetic material may be shared with other agents, and our inclusive reward function naturally accounts for this. We study the resulting social dynamics in two types of network games with prisoner's dilemmas and find that our results align with well-established principles from biology, such as Hamilton's rule. Furthermore, we outline how this framework can extend to more open-ended environments with spatial and temporal structure, finite resources, and evolving populations. We hypothesize the emergence of an arms race of strategies, where each new strategy is a gradual improvement over earlier adaptations of other agents, effectively producing a multi-agent autocurriculum analogous to biological evolution. In contrast to the binary team-based structures prevalent in earlier research, our gene-based reward structure introduces a spectrum of cooperation ranging from full adversity to full cooperativeness based on genetic similarity, enabling unique non team-based social dynamics. For example, one agent having a mutual cooperative relationship with two other agents, while the two other agents behave adversarially towards each other. We argue that incorporating inclusive fitness in agents provides a foundation for the emergence of more strategically advanced and socially intelligent agents.</description>

      <title>HardcoreLogic: Challenging Large Reasoning Models with Long-tail Logic Puzzle Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on complex tasks, including logical puzzle games that require deriving solutions satisfying all constraints. However, whether they can flexibly apply appropriate rules to varying conditions, particularly when faced with non-canonical game variants, remains an open question. Existing corpora focus on popular puzzles like 9x9 Sudoku, risking overfitting to canonical formats and memorization of solution patterns, which can mask deficiencies in understanding novel rules or adapting strategies to new variants. To address this, we introduce HardcoreLogic, a challenging benchmark of over 5,000 puzzles across 10 games, designed to test the robustness of LRMs on the "long-tail" of logical games. HardcoreLogic systematically transforms canonical puzzles through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE), and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP), reducing reliance on shortcut memorization. Evaluations on a diverse set of LRMs reveal significant performance drops, even for models achieving top scores on existing benchmarks, indicating heavy reliance on memorized stereotypes. While increased complexity is the dominant source of difficulty, models also struggle with subtle rule variations that do not necessarily increase puzzle difficulty. Our systematic error analysis on solvable and unsolvable puzzles further highlights gaps in genuine reasoning. Overall, HardcoreLogic exposes the limitations of current LRMs and establishes a benchmark for advancing high-level logical reasoning.</description>

      <title>Memory as Action: Autonomous Context Curation for Long-Horizon Agentic Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models face challenges in long-horizon agentic tasks as their constrained memory is easily overwhelmed by distracting or irrelevant context. Existing working memory methods typically rely on external, heuristic mechanisms that are decoupled from the agent's core policy. In this work, we reframe working memory management as a learnable, intrinsic capability. We propose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages its working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a unified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement learning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under given resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the standard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions, leading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt the causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making those methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm, Dynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end reinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and applying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments. Our results demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task reasoning and memory management in an end-to-end fashion not only reduces overall computational consumption but also improves task performance, driven by adaptive context curation strategies tailored to the model's intrinsic capabilities.</description>

      <title>ERA: Transforming VLMs into Embodied Agents via Embodied Prior Learning and Online Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present \textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2) Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of 8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for future embodied AI systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Debate for LLM Judges with Adaptive Stability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With advancements in reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for automated judgment tasks. While LLMs-as-Judges offer promise in automating evaluations, current approaches often rely on simplistic aggregation methods (e.g., majority voting), which can fail even when individual agents provide correct answers. To address this, we propose a multi-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and iteratively refine their responses. We formalize the debate process mathematically, analyzing agent interactions and proving that debate amplifies correctness compared to static ensembles. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a stability detection mechanism that models judge consensus dynamics via a time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture, with adaptive stopping based on distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This mechanism models the judges' collective correct rate dynamics using a time-varying mixture of Beta-Binomial distributions and employs an adaptive stopping criterion based on distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic). Experiments across multiple benchmarks and models demonstrate that our framework improves judgment accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>CAMNet: Leveraging Cooperative Awareness Messages for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous driving remains a challenging task, particularly due to safety concerns. Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network, Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Artificial Intelligence: Self-Supervised Learning Approach for Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robustness in AI systems refers to their ability to maintain reliable and accurate performance under various conditions, including out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, adversarial attacks, and environmental changes. This is crucial in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, or healthcare, where malfunctions could have severe consequences. This paper proposes an approach to improve OOD detection without the need of labeled data, thereby increasing the AI systems' robustness. The proposed approach leverages the principles of self-supervised learning, allowing the model to learn useful representations from unlabeled data. Combined with graph-theoretical techniques, this enables the more efficient identification and categorization of OOD samples. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, this approach achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) = 0.99.</description>

      <title>Clutch Control: An Attention-based Combinatorial Bandit for Efficient Mutation in JavaScript Engine Fuzzing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JavaScript engines are widely used in web browsers, PDF readers, and server-side applications. The rise in concern over their security has led to the development of several targeted fuzzing techniques. However, existing approaches use random selection to determine where to perform mutations in JavaScript code. We postulate that the problem of selecting better mutation targets is suitable for combinatorial bandits with a volatile number of arms. Thus, we propose CLUTCH, a novel deep combinatorial bandit that can observe variable length JavaScript test case representations, using an attention mechanism from deep learning. Furthermore, using Concrete Dropout, CLUTCH can dynamically adapt its exploration. We show that CLUTCH increases efficiency in JavaScript fuzzing compared to three state-of-the-art solutions by increasing the number of valid test cases and coverage-per-testcase by, respectively, 20.3% and 8.9% on average. In volatile and combinatorial settings we show that CLUTCH outperforms state-of-the-art bandits, achieving at least 78.1% and 4.1% less regret in volatile and combinatorial settings, respectively.</description>

      <title>CTRL-Rec: Controlling Recommender Systems With Natural Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When users are dissatisfied with recommendations from a recommender system, they often lack fine-grained controls for changing them. Large language models (LLMs) offer a solution by allowing users to guide their recommendations through natural language requests (e.g., "I want to see respectful posts with a different perspective than mine"). We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows for natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time with computational efficiency. Specifically, at training time, we use an LLM to simulate whether users would approve of items based on their language requests, and we train embedding models that approximate such simulated judgments. We then integrate these user-request-based predictions into the standard weighting of signals that traditional recommender systems optimize. At deployment time, we require only a single LLM embedding computation per user request, allowing for real-time control of recommendations. In experiments with the MovieLens dataset, our method consistently allows for fine-grained control across a diversity of requests. In a study with 19 Letterboxd users, we find that CTRL-Rec was positively received by users and significantly enhanced users' sense of control and satisfaction with recommendations compared to traditional controls.</description>

      <title>Ax-Prover: A Deep Reasoning Agentic Framework for Theorem Proving in Mathematics and Quantum Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Ax-Prover, a multi-agent system for automated theorem proving in Lean that can solve problems across diverse scientific domains and operate either autonomously or collaboratively with human experts. To achieve this, Ax-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof generation, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic rigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models (LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its performance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier LLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two Lean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum theory. On public datasets, Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art provers, while it largely outperform them on the new benchmarks. This shows that, unlike specialized systems that struggle to generalize, our tool-based agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal verification across diverse scientific domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate Ax-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it enabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex cryptography theorem.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLMs, IDEs, and Semantic Embeddings for Automated Move Method Refactoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MOVEMETHOD is a hallmark refactoring. Despite a plethora of research tools that recommend which methods to move and where, these recommendations do not align with how expert developers perform MOVEMETHOD. Given the extensive training of Large Language Models and their reliance upon naturalness of code, they should expertly recommend which methods are misplaced in a given class and which classes are better hosts. Our formative study of 2016 LLM recommendations revealed that LLMs give expert suggestions, yet they are unreliable: up to 80% of the suggestions are hallucinations. We introduce the first LLM fully powered assistant for MOVEMETHOD refactoring that automates its whole end-to-end lifecycle, from recommendation to execution. We designed novel solutions that automatically filter LLM hallucinations using static analysis from IDEs and a novel workflow that requires LLMs to be self-consistent, critique, and rank refactoring suggestions. As MOVEMETHOD refactoring requires global, projectlevel reasoning, we solved the limited context size of LLMs by employing refactoring-aware retrieval augment generation (RAG). Our approach, MM-assist, synergistically combines the strengths of the LLM, IDE, static analysis, and semantic relevance. In our thorough, multi-methodology empirical evaluation, we compare MM-assist with the previous state-of-the-art approaches. MM-assist significantly outperforms them: (i) on a benchmark widely used by other researchers, our Recall@1 and Recall@3 show a 1.7x improvement; (ii) on a corpus of 210 recent refactorings from Open-source software, our Recall rates improve by at least 2.4x. Lastly, we conducted a user study with 30 experienced participants who used MM-assist to refactor their own code for one week. They rated 82.8% of MM-assist recommendations positively. This shows that MM-assist is both effective and useful.</description>

      <title>Modeling Hypergraph Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the advantages of hypergraphs in modeling high-order relationships in complex systems, they have been applied to higher-order clustering, hypergraph neural networks and computer vision. These applications rely heavily on access to high-quality, large-scale real-world hypergraph data. Yet, compared to traditional pairwise graphs, real hypergraph datasets remain scarce in both scale and diversity. This shortage significantly limits the development and evaluation of advanced hypergraph learning algorithms. Therefore, how to quickly generate large-scale hypergraphs that conform to the characteristics of real networks is a crucial task that has not received sufficient attention. Motivated by recent advances in large language models (LLMs), particularly their capabilities in semantic reasoning, structured generation, and simulating human behavior, we investigate whether LLMs can facilitate hypergraph generation from a fundamentally new perspective. We introduce HyperLLM, a novel LLM-driven hypergraph generator that simulates the formation and evolution of hypergraphs through a multi-agent collaboration. The framework integrates prompts and structural feedback mechanisms to ensure that the generated hypergraphs reflect key real-world patterns. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that HyperLLM achieves superior fidelity to structural and temporal hypergraph patterns, while requiring minimal statistical priors. Our findings suggest that LLM-based frameworks offer a promising new direction for hypergraph modeling.</description>

      <title>Serial-Parallel Dual-Path Architecture for Speaking Style Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speaking Style Recognition (SSR) identifies a speaker's speaking style characteristics from speech. Existing style recognition approaches primarily rely on linguistic information, with limited integration of acoustic information, which restricts recognition accuracy improvements. The fusion of acoustic and linguistic modalities offers significant potential to enhance recognition performance. In this paper, we propose a novel serial-parallel dual-path architecture for SSR that leverages acoustic-linguistic bimodal information. The serial path follows the ASR+STYLE serial paradigm, reflecting a sequential temporal dependency, while the parallel path integrates our designed Acoustic-Linguistic Similarity Module (ALSM) to facilitate cross-modal interaction with temporal simultaneity. Compared to the existing SSR baseline -- the OSUM model, our approach reduces parameter size by 88.4% and achieves a 30.3% improvement in SSR accuracy for eight styles on the test set.</description>

      <title>Scaling Law in LLM Simulated Personality: More Detailed and Realistic Persona Profile Is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research focuses on using large language models (LLMs) to simulate social experiments, exploring their ability to emulate human personality in virtual persona role-playing. The research develops an end-to-end evaluation framework, including individual-level analysis of stability and identifiability, as well as population-level analysis called progressive personality curves to examine the veracity and consistency of LLMs in simulating human personality. Methodologically, this research proposes important modifications to traditional psychometric approaches (CFA and construct validity) which are unable to capture improvement trends in LLMs at their current low-level simulation, potentially leading to remature rejection or methodological misalignment. The main contributions of this research are: proposing a systematic framework for LLM virtual personality evaluation; empirically demonstrating the critical role of persona detail in personality simulation quality; and identifying marginal utility effects of persona profiles, especially a Scaling Law in LLM personality simulation, offering operational evaluation metrics and a theoretical foundation for applying large language models in social science experiments.</description>

      <title>SeeingSounds: Learning Audio-to-Visual Alignment via Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SeeingSounds, a lightweight and modular framework for audio-to-image generation that leverages the interplay between audio, language, and vision-without requiring any paired audio-visual data or training on visual generative models. Rather than treating audio as a substitute for text or relying solely on audio-to-text mappings, our method performs dual alignment: audio is projected into a semantic language space via a frozen language encoder, and, contextually grounded into the visual domain using a vision-language model. This approach, inspired by cognitive neuroscience, reflects the natural cross-modal associations observed in human perception. The model operates on frozen diffusion backbones and trains only lightweight adapters, enabling efficient and scalable learning. Moreover, it supports fine-grained and interpretable control through procedural text prompt generation, where audio transformations (e.g., volume or pitch shifts) translate into descriptive prompts (e.g., "a distant thunder") that guide visual outputs. Extensive experiments across standard benchmarks confirm that SeeingSounds outperforms existing methods in both zero-shot and supervised settings, establishing a new state of the art in controllable audio-to-visual generation.</description>

      <title>Celebrity Profiling on Short Urdu Text using Twitter Followers' Feed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media has become an essential part of the digital age, serving as a platform for communication, interaction, and information sharing. Celebrities are among the most active users and often reveal aspects of their personal and professional lives through online posts. Platforms such as Twitter provide an opportunity to analyze language and behavior for understanding demographic and social patterns. Since followers frequently share linguistic traits and interests with the celebrities they follow, textual data from followers can be used to predict celebrity demographics. However, most existing research in this field has focused on English and other high-resource languages, leaving Urdu largely unexplored.
  This study applies modern machine learning and deep learning techniques to the problem of celebrity profiling in Urdu. A dataset of short Urdu tweets from followers of subcontinent celebrities was collected and preprocessed. Multiple algorithms were trained and compared, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory networks. The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and cumulative rank (cRank). The best performance was achieved for gender prediction with a cRank of 0.65 and an accuracy of 0.65, followed by moderate results for age, profession, and fame prediction. These results demonstrate that follower-based linguistic features can be effectively leveraged using machine learning and neural approaches for demographic prediction in Urdu, a low-resource language.</description>

      <title>Fast and Interpretable Protein Substructure Alignment via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins are essential biological macromolecules that execute life functions. Local motifs within protein structures, such as active sites, are the most critical components for linking structure to function and are key to understanding protein evolution and enabling protein engineering. Existing computational methods struggle to identify and compare these local structures, which leaves a significant gap in understanding protein structures and harnessing their functions. This study presents PLASMA, the first deep learning framework for efficient and interpretable residue-level protein substructure alignment. We reformulate the problem as a regularized optimal transport task and leverage differentiable Sinkhorn iterations. For a pair of input protein structures, PLASMA outputs a clear alignment matrix with an interpretable overall similarity score. Through extensive quantitative evaluations and three biological case studies, we demonstrate that PLASMA achieves accurate, lightweight, and interpretable residue-level alignment. Additionally, we introduce PLASMA-PF, a training-free variant that provides a practical alternative when training data are unavailable. Our method addresses a critical gap in protein structure analysis tools and offers new opportunities for functional annotation, evolutionary studies, and structure-based drug design. Reproducibility is ensured via our official implementation at https://github.com/ZW471/PLASMA-Protein-Local-Alignment.git.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Large Language Model Agents for Fully Automated Radiotherapy Treatment Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation therapy treatment planning is an iterative, expertise-dependent process, and the growing burden of cancer cases has made reliance on manual planning increasingly unsustainable, underscoring the need for automation. In this study, we propose a workflow that leverages a large language model (LLM)-based agent to navigate inverse treatment planning for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The LLM agent was implemented to directly interact with a clinical treatment planning system (TPS) to iteratively extract intermediate plan states and propose new constraint values to guide inverse optimization. The agent's decision-making process is informed by current observations and previous optimization attempts and evaluations, allowing for dynamic strategy refinement. The planning process was performed in a zero-shot inference setting, where the LLM operated without prior exposure to manually generated treatment plans and was utilized without any fine-tuning or task-specific training. The LLM-generated plans were evaluated on twenty head-and-neck cancer cases against clinical manual plans, with key dosimetric endpoints analyzed and reported. The LLM-generated plans achieved comparable organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing relative to clinical plans while demonstrating improved hot spot control (Dmax: 106.5% vs. 108.8%) and superior conformity (conformity index: 1.18 vs. 1.39 for boost PTV; 1.82 vs. 1.88 for primary PTV). This study demonstrates the feasibility of a zero-shot, LLM-driven workflow for automated IMRT treatment planning in a commercial TPS. The proposed approach provides a generalizable and clinically applicable solution that could reduce planning variability and support broader adoption of AI-based planning strategies.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence for Optimal Learning: A Comparative Approach towards AI-Enhanced Learning Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving educational landscape, the integration of technology has shifted from an enhancement to a cornerstone of educational strategy worldwide. This transition is propelled by advancements in digital technology, especially the emergence of artificial intelligence as a crucial tool in learning environments. This research project critically evaluates the impact of three distinct educational settings: traditional educational methods without technological integration, those enhanced by non-AI technology, and those utilising AI-driven technologies. This comparison aims to assess how each environment influences educational outcomes, engagement, pedagogical methods, and equity in access to learning resources, and how each contributes uniquely to the learning experience. The ultimate goal of this research is to synthesise the strengths of each model to create a more holistic educational approach. By integrating the personal interaction and tested pedagogical techniques of traditional classrooms, the enhanced accessibility and collaborative tools offered by non-AI technology, and the personalised, adaptive learning strategies enabled by AI-driven technologies, education systems can develop richer, more effective learning environments. This hybrid approach aims to leverage the best elements of each setting, thereby enhancing educational outcomes, engagement, and inclusiveness, while also addressing the distinct challenges and limitations inherent in each model. The intention is to create an educational framework deeply attentive to the diverse needs of students, ensuring equitable access to high-quality education for all.</description>

      <title>The Adoption Paradox: A Comparative Analysis of Veterinary AI Adoption in China and the North America</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study compares the perception, adoption, and application of artificial intelligence (AI) among veterinary professionals in China and North America (NA), testing the hypothesis that adoption patterns are shaped by regional market and demographic factors. A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was conducted with 455 veterinary professionals in China between May and July 2025. The results were compared with published data from a 2024 survey of 3,968 veterinary professionals in the United States and Canada. The Chinese cohort, primarily composed of clinicians (81.5%), showed a high AI adoption rate (71.0%) despite low familiarity (55.4%). Their AI use was focused on clinical tasks, such as disease diagnosis (50.1%) and prescription calculation (44.8%). In contrast, the NA cohort reported high familiarity (83.8%) but a lower adoption rate (39.2%). Their priorities were administrative, including imaging analysis (39.0%) and record-keeping (39.0%). Concerns about AI reliability and accuracy were the top barrier in both groups. Our findings reveal an "adoption paradox" where the Chinese market demonstrates a practitioner-driven, bottom-up adoption model focused on augmenting clinical efficacy, while the NA market shows a more cautious, structured, top-down integration aimed at improving administrative efficiency. This suggests that a one-size-fits-all approach to AI development and integration is insufficient, and tailored, region-specific strategies are necessary to responsibly incorporate AI into global veterinary practice.</description>

      <title>AwareCompiler: Agentic Context-Aware Compiler Optimization via a Synergistic Knowledge-Data Driven Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compiler optimization is crucial for enhancing program performance by transforming the sequence of optimization passes while maintaining correctness. Despite the promising potential of large language models (LLMs)-based agent for software optimization, automating compiler optimization remains challenging due to: (1) semantic misalignment between abstract program representations and concrete optimization passes, (2) inefficient interaction mechanisms between agents and compiler environments, and (3) reward sparsity from the extensive decision-making process within large optimization spaces. This paper introduces \textbf{AwareCompiler}, an agentic framework for compiler optimization that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: structured knowledge integration and dataset construction, knowledge-driven adaptive pass generation, and data-driven hybrid training pipeline. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that AwareCompiler significantly outperforms existing baselines in both performance and efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of our synergistic knowledge-data-driven approach. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/LHY-24/AwareCompiler.</description>

      <title>Audio-Guided Visual Perception for Audio-Visual Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Embodied Navigation aims to enable agents to autonomously navigate to sound sources in unknown 3D environments using auditory cues. While current AVN methods excel on in-distribution sound sources, they exhibit poor cross-source generalization: navigation success rates plummet and search paths become excessively long when agents encounter unheard sounds or unseen environments. This limitation stems from the lack of explicit alignment mechanisms between auditory signals and corresponding visual regions. Policies tend to memorize spurious \enquote{acoustic fingerprint-scenario} correlations during training, leading to blind exploration when exposed to novel sound sources. To address this, we propose the AGVP framework, which transforms sound from policy-memorable acoustic fingerprint cues into spatial guidance. The framework first extracts global auditory context via audio self-attention, then uses this context as queries to guide visual feature attention, highlighting sound-source-related regions at the feature level. Subsequent temporal modeling and policy optimization are then performed. This design, centered on interpretable cross-modal alignment and region reweighting, reduces dependency on specific acoustic fingerprints. Experimental results demonstrate that AGVP improves both navigation efficiency and robustness while achieving superior cross-scenario generalization on previously unheard sounds.</description>

      <title>GAR: Generative Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Formal Theorem Proving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving math problems through verifiable languages such as Lean has significantly impacted both the mathematics and computer science communities. Current state-of-the-art models are often trained with expensive online Reinforcement Learning (RL) or expert iteration. However, these approaches rely on fixed problem sets, which causes inefficient training and limits the model to tackle complex problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose GAR: Generative Adversarial Reinforcement learning, a comprehensive RL training framework that jointly trains the problem composer and solver in an adversarial loop. GAR introduces an implicit curriculum learning mechanism, which aligns task difficulty with the prover's evolving capability. It thereby improves the training efficiency and enables stronger performance of proving advanced theorems. Experiments show that with GAR training, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieve an average relative improvement in pass@32 of 4.20% on MiniF2F-Test benchmark, while DeepSeek-Prover-V2's pass@32 on ProofNet-Test increases from 22.58% to 25.81%. Beyond formal proving, GAR establishes a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and solving under verifiable environments.</description>

      <title>PHANTOM RECALL: When Familiar Puzzles Fool Smart Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Gemini, and Claude often appear adept at solving classic logic puzzles--but how much genuine reasoning underlies their answers? Recent evidence suggests that these models frequently rely on memorized templates rather than reasoning from first principles. When puzzles are slightly modified, their performance collapses, revealing a striking fragility. In particular, we asked: Have LLMs addressed these issues? To what extent? How about perturbations to other puzzles? Is there a general way of reformulating the prompt so that the models do better? To examine these things systematically, we introduce PHANTOM RECALL, a benchmark comprising 25 well-known logic puzzles and 149 carefully designed perturbations that preserve reasoning structure but alter superficial details and solutions. We evaluate eleven leading LLMs and identify a recurring failure mode--phantom recall--where models confidently reproduce memorized solutions or spurious rationales that no longer fit the altered scenario. To probe and mitigate this issue, we contribute three tools: (i) an automated logical-equivalence judge to detect reasoning mismatches, (ii) a taxonomy of fine-grained reasoning error categories, and (iii) a prompting-based mitigation framework guided by these categories. Despite near-perfect accuracy on unmodified puzzles, models significantly underperform humans on perturbed ones, exhibiting both phantom recall and over-elaboration. Our findings reveal a crucial limitation: LLMs often fail to re-reason when contextual cues shift--highlighting the gap between linguistic fluency and logical understanding.</description>

      <title>BlackIce: A Containerized Red Teaming Toolkit for AI Security Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI models are being increasingly integrated into real-world systems, raising significant concerns about their safety and security. Consequently, AI red teaming has become essential for organizations to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by adversaries. While numerous AI red teaming tools currently exist, practitioners face challenges in selecting the most appropriate tools from a rapidly expanding landscape, as well as managing complex and frequently conflicting software dependencies across isolated projects. Given these challenges and the relatively small number of organizations with dedicated AI red teams, there is a strong need to lower barriers to entry and establish a standardized environment that simplifies the setup and execution of comprehensive AI model assessments.
  Inspired by Kali Linux's role in traditional penetration testing, we introduce BlackIce, an open-source containerized toolkit designed for red teaming Large Language Models (LLMs) and classical machine learning (ML) models. BlackIce provides a reproducible, version-pinned Docker image that bundles 14 carefully selected open-source tools for Responsible AI and Security testing, all accessible via a unified command-line interface. With this setup, initiating red team assessments is as straightforward as launching a container, either locally or using a cloud platform. Additionally, the image's modular architecture facilitates community-driven extensions, allowing users to easily adapt or expand the toolkit as new threats emerge. In this paper, we describe the architecture of the container image, the process used for selecting tools, and the types of evaluations they support.</description>

      <title>Empirical Study on Robustness and Resilience in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), it is a common practice to tune hyperparameters in ideal simulated environments to maximize cooperative performance. However, policies tuned for cooperation often fail to maintain robustness and resilience under real-world uncertainties. Building trustworthy MARL systems requires a deep understanding of robustness, which ensures stability under uncertainties, and resilience, the ability to recover from disruptions--a concept extensively studied in control systems but largely overlooked in MARL. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study comprising over 82,620 experiments to evaluate cooperation, robustness, and resilience in MARL across 4 real-world environments, 13 uncertainty types, and 15 hyperparameters. Our key findings are: (1) Under mild uncertainty, optimizing cooperation improves robustness and resilience, but this link weakens as perturbations intensify. Robustness and resilience also varies by algorithm and uncertainty type. (2) Robustness and resilience do not generalize across uncertainty modalities or agent scopes: policies robust to action noise for all agents may fail under observation noise on a single agent. (3) Hyperparameter tuning is critical for trustworthy MARL: surprisingly, standard practices like parameter sharing, GAE, and PopArt can hurt robustness, while early stopping, high critic learning rates, and Leaky ReLU consistently help. By optimizing hyperparameters only, we observe substantial improvement in cooperation, robustness and resilience across all MARL backbones, with the phenomenon also generalizing to robust MARL methods across these backbones.

      <title>Combining Euclidean and Hyperbolic Representations for Node-level Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Node-level anomaly detection (NAD) is challenging due to diverse structural patterns and feature distributions. As such, NAD is a critical task with several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the original features and structural features derived from random walks and degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.</description>

      <title>Data or Language Supervision: What Makes CLIP Better than DINO?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings -- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration -- achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder design and its impact on VLM performance.</description>

      <title>Countermind: A Multi-Layered Security Architecture for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The security of Large Language Model (LLM) applications is fundamentally challenged by "form-first" attacks like prompt injection and jailbreaking, where malicious instructions are embedded within user inputs. Conventional defenses, which rely on post hoc output filtering, are often brittle and fail to address the root cause: the model's inability to distinguish trusted instructions from untrusted data. This paper proposes Countermind, a multi-layered security architecture intended to shift defenses from a reactive, post hoc posture to a proactive, pre-inference, and intra-inference enforcement model. The architecture proposes a fortified perimeter designed to structurally validate and transform all inputs, and an internal governance mechanism intended to constrain the model's semantic processing pathways before an output is generated. The primary contributions of this work are conceptual designs for: (1) A Semantic Boundary Logic (SBL) with a mandatory, time-coupled Text Crypter intended to reduce the plaintext prompt injection attack surface, provided all ingestion paths are enforced. (2) A Parameter-Space Restriction (PSR) mechanism, leveraging principles from representation engineering, to dynamically control the LLM's access to internal semantic clusters, with the goal of mitigating semantic drift and dangerous emergent behaviors. (3) A Secure, Self-Regulating Core that uses an OODA loop and a learning security module to adapt its defenses based on an immutable audit log. (4) A Multimodal Input Sandbox and Context-Defense mechanisms to address threats from non-textual data and long-term semantic poisoning. This paper outlines an evaluation plan designed to quantify the proposed architecture's effectiveness in reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for form-first attacks and to measure its potential latency overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has transformed vision encoder training in general domains but remains underutilized in medical imaging due to limited data and domain specific biases. We present MammoDINO, a novel SSL framework for mammography, pretrained on 1.4 million mammographic images. To capture clinically meaningful features, we introduce a breast tissue aware data augmentation sampler for both image-level and patch-level supervision and a cross-slice contrastive learning objective that leverages 3D digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) structure into 2D pretraining. MammoDINO achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple breast cancer screening tasks and generalizes well across five benchmark datasets. It offers a scalable, annotation-free foundation for multipurpose computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools for mammogram, helping reduce radiologists' workload and improve diagnostic efficiency in breast cancer screening.</description>

      <title>Integrating Sequential and Relational Modeling for User Events: Datasets and Prediction Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User event modeling plays a central role in many machine learning applications, with use cases spanning e-commerce, social media, finance, cybersecurity, and other domains. User events can be broadly categorized into personal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which involve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically modeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and graph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both event types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them together. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior can be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence or a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and prediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational events. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a unified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from incorporating both event types. Our results also indicate that current methods leave a notable room for improvements. We release these resources to support further research in unified user event modeling and encourage progress in this direction.</description>

      <title>Indoor Localization using Compact, Telemetry-Agnostic, Transfer-Learning Enabled Decoder-Only Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor Wi-Fi positioning remains a challenging problem due to the high sensitivity of radio signals to environmental dynamics, channel propagation characteristics, and hardware heterogeneity. Conventional fingerprinting and model-based approaches typically require labor-intensive calibration and suffer rapid performance degradation when devices, channel or deployment conditions change. In this paper, we introduce Locaris, a decoder-only large language model (LLM) for indoor localization. Locaris treats each access point (AP) measurement as a token, enabling the ingestion of raw Wi-Fi telemetry without pre-processing. By fine-tuning its LLM on different Wi-Fi datasets, Locaris learns a lightweight and generalizable mapping from raw signals directly to device location. Our experimental study comparing Locaris with state-of-the-art methods consistently shows that Locaris matches or surpasses existing techniques for various types of telemetry. Our results demonstrate that compact LLMs can serve as calibration-free regression models for indoor localization, offering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous Wi-Fi deployments. Few-shot adaptation experiments, using only a handful of calibration points per device, further show that Locaris maintains high accuracy when applied to previously unseen devices and deployment scenarios. This yields sub-meter accuracy with just a few hundred samples, robust performance under missing APs and supports any and all available telemetry. Our findings highlight the practical viability of Locaris for indoor positioning in the real-world scenarios, particularly in large-scale deployments where extensive calibration is infeasible.</description>

      <title>Discrepancy Detection at the Data Level: Toward Consistent Multilingual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilingual question answering (QA) systems must ensure factual consistency across languages, especially for objective queries such as What is jaundice?, while also accounting for cultural variation in subjective responses. We propose MIND, a user-in-the-loop fact-checking pipeline to detect factual and cultural discrepancies in multilingual QA knowledge bases. MIND highlights divergent answers to culturally sensitive questions (e.g., Who assists in childbirth?) that vary by region and context. We evaluate MIND on a bilingual QA system in the maternal and infant health domain and release a dataset of bilingual questions annotated for factual and cultural inconsistencies. We further test MIND on datasets from other domains to assess generalization. In all cases, MIND reliably identifies inconsistencies, supporting the development of more culturally aware and factually consistent QA systems.</description>

      <title>TopoAlign: A Framework for Aligning Code to Math via Topological Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at both informal and formal (e.g. Lean 4) mathematical reasoning but still struggle with autoformalisation, the task of transforming informal into formal mathematical statements. Autoformalisation helps pair the informal reasoning of LLMs with formal proof assistants which enable machine-verifiable generation and mitigate hallucinations. Yet, the performance of current Math LLMs is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale corpora, particularly those containing pairs of informal and formal statements. Although current models are trained to generate code from natural language instructions, structural and syntactic differences between these and formal mathematics limit effective transfer learning. We propose TopoAlign, a framework that unlocks widely available code repositories as training resources for Math LLMs. TopoAlign decomposes code into docstrings, main functions, and dependency functions, and reassembles these components into analogues that structurally mirror formal statements. This produces structurally aligned code data that can be used for training Math LLMs without requiring additional human annotation. We train two state-of-the-art models, DeepSeek-Math and Herald, and evaluate them on the minif2f, Putnam, and ProofNet benchmarks. TopoAlign provides substantial gains for DeepSeek-Math, improving performance by 17.77% on BEq@10 and 68.82% on typecheck@10. Despite introducing no new mathematical knowledge, our framework achieves gains of 0.12% and 1.09% for Herald on BEq@10 and typecheck@10, respectively, demonstrating that training on aligned code data is beneficial even for specialized models.</description>

      <title>Sculpting Latent Spaces With MMD: Disentanglement With Programmable Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning disentangled representations, where distinct factors of variation are captured by independent latent variables, is a central goal in machine learning. The dominant approach has been the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework, which uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to encourage the latent space to match a factorized Gaussian prior. In this work, however, we provide direct evidence that this KL-based regularizer is an unreliable mechanism, consistently failing to enforce the target distribution on the aggregate posterior. We validate this and quantify the resulting entanglement using our novel, unsupervised Latent Predictability Score (LPS). To address this failure, we introduce the Programmable Prior Framework, a method built on the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Our framework allows practitioners to explicitly sculpt the latent space, achieving state-of-the-art mutual independence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet without the common reconstruction trade-off. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this programmability can be used to engineer sophisticated priors that improve alignment with semantically meaningful features. Ultimately, our work provides a foundational tool for representation engineering, opening new avenues for model identifiability and causal reasoning.</description>

      <title>Y-shaped Generative Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern continuous-time generative models often induce V-shaped transport: each sample travels independently along nearly straight trajectories from prior to data, overlooking shared structure. We introduce Y-shaped generative flows, which move probability mass together along shared pathways before branching to target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is based on novel velocity-powered transport cost with a sublinear exponent (between zero and one). this concave dependence rewards joint and fast mass movement. Practically, we instantiate the idea in a scalable neural ODE training objective. On synthetic, image, and biology datasets, Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reach targets with fewer integration steps.</description>

      <title>Direct Multi-Token Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoder-only transformers have become the standard architecture for large language models (LLMs) due to their strong performance. Recent studies suggest that, in pre-trained LLMs, early, middle, and late layers may serve distinct roles: Early layers focus on understanding the input context, middle layers handle task-specific processing, and late layers convert abstract representations into output tokens. We hypothesize that once representations have been processed by the early and middle layers, the resulting hidden states may encapsulate sufficient information to support the generation of multiple tokens using only the late layers, eliminating the need to repeatedly traverse the early and middle layers. We refer to this inference paradigm as Direct Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD). Unlike speculative decoding, our method introduces no additional parameters, auxiliary routines, or post-generation verification. Despite being trained on a limited dataset, a fine-tuned DMTD Qwen3-4B model has already demonstrated promising results, achieving up to a 2x speedup with only minor performance loss. Moreover, as shown in our scaling analysis, its performance is expected to further improve with larger training datasets.</description>

      <title>CTIArena: Benchmarking LLM Knowledge and Reasoning Across Heterogeneous Cyber Threat Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is central to modern cybersecurity, providing critical insights for detecting and mitigating evolving threats. With the natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in applying them to CTI, which calls for benchmarks that can rigorously evaluate their performance. Several early efforts have studied LLMs on some CTI tasks but remain limited: (i) they adopt only closed-book settings, relying on parametric knowledge without leveraging CTI knowledge bases; (ii) they cover only a narrow set of tasks, lacking a systematic view of the CTI landscape; and (iii) they restrict evaluation to single-source analysis, unlike realistic scenarios that require reasoning across multiple sources. To fill these gaps, we present CTIArena, the first benchmark for evaluating LLM performance on heterogeneous, multi-source CTI under knowledge-augmented settings. CTIArena spans three categories, structured, unstructured, and hybrid, further divided into nine tasks that capture the breadth of CTI analysis in modern security operations. We evaluate ten widely used LLMs and find that most struggle in closed-book setups but show noticeable gains when augmented with security-specific knowledge through our designed retrieval-augmented techniques. These findings highlight the limitations of general-purpose LLMs and the need for domain-tailored techniques to fully unlock their potential for CTI.</description>

      <title>Learning Dynamics of VLM Finetuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preference-based finetuning of vision--language models (VLMs) is brittle: trivially wrong negatives inject uninformative gradients that destabilize training. We recast alignment as \textbf{learning-dynamics--aware optimization} and introduce \textbf{Cooling-Weighted DPO (CW-DPO)}, a two-stage recipe that explicitly models and exploits the training trajectory. \textbf{Stage 1} performs supervised finetuning with \textbf{gentle negatives}: \textbf{low-weight smoothed supervision} that regularizes the base policy and curbs overconfidence without explicit penalties. \textbf{Stage 2} applies a DPO objective in which the \textbf{negative term is scaled by a cooling weight} computed from the model's \textbf{average token log-probability} on each negative, suppressing uninformative gradients from easy or off-distribution samples while preserving signal from hard negatives. In practice, we emphasize \textbf{on-policy negatives} and allow \textbf{mixed negatives} by blending a controllable fraction of dataset negatives to maintain contrast freshness. Throughout, we instrument training with $\Delta\!\log p$ probes on positives and negatives as first-class signals for early stopping, curriculum design, and failure diagnosis. Across diverse VLM tasks, CW-DPO yields \textbf{more stable optimization}, \textbf{better calibration}, and \textbf{higher pairwise win-rates} than SFT-only and vanilla DPO, while \textbf{converging in fewer steps}. Ablations isolate the \textbf{cooling-weight mechanism} as the primary driver of these gains and show complementary benefits from mixing on-policy and dataset negatives. Taken together, our results show that \textbf{smoothing learning dynamics before cooling preferences} is a simple, general principle for robust VLM alignment.</description>

      <title>Conjecturing: An Overlooked Step in Formal Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoformalisation, the task of expressing informal mathematical statements in formal language, is often viewed as a direct translation process. This, however, disregards a critical preceding step: conjecturing. Many mathematical problems cannot be formalised directly without first conjecturing a conclusion such as an explicit answer, or a specific bound. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) already struggle with autoformalisation, and the evaluation of their conjecturing ability is limited and often entangled within autoformalisation or proof, it is particularly challenging to understand its effect. To address this gap, we augment existing datasets to create ConjectureBench, and redesign the evaluation framework and metric specifically to measure the conjecturing capabilities of LLMs both as a distinct task and within the autoformalisation pipeline. Our evaluation of foundational models, including GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, reveals that their autoformalisation performance is substantially overestimated when the conjecture is accounted for during evaluation. However, the conjecture should not be assumed to be provided. We design an inference-time method, Lean-FIRe to improve conjecturing and autoformalisation, which, to the best of our knowledge, achieves the first successful end-to-end autoformalisation of 13 PutnamBench problems with GPT-4.1 and 7 with DeepSeek-V3.1. We demonstrate that while LLMs possess the requisite knowledge to generate accurate conjectures, improving autoformalisation performance requires treating conjecturing as an independent task, and investigating further how to correctly integrate it within autoformalisation. Finally, we provide forward-looking guidance to steer future research toward improving conjecturing, an overlooked step of formal mathematical reasoning.</description>

      <title>PanoTPS-Net: Panoramic Room Layout Estimation via Thin Plate Spline Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer vision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and interior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate room layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial transformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages: First, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the input images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS transformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to warp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted parameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room layouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid layouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation and emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama images. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room layout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and 91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets, respectively.

      <title>CPR: Mitigating Large Language Model Hallucinations with Curative Prompt Refinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) highlight their fluency in generating responses to diverse prompts. However, these models sometimes generate plausible yet incorrect ``hallucinated" facts, undermining trust. A frequent but often overlooked cause of such errors is the use of poorly structured or vague prompts by users, leading LLMs to base responses on assumed rather than actual intentions. To mitigate hallucinations induced by these ill-formed prompts, we introduce Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR), a plug-and-play framework for curative prompt refinement that 1) cleans ill-formed prompts, and 2) generates additional informative task descriptions to align the intention of the user and the prompt using a fine-tuned small language model. When applied to language models, we discover that CPR significantly increases the quality of generation while also mitigating hallucination. Empirical studies show that prompts with CPR applied achieves over a 90\% win rate over the original prompts without any external knowledge.</description>

      <title>Multi-stage Prompt Refinement for Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, LLMs continue to encounter challenges with hallucinations, where models generate plausible but incorrect information. While several factors contribute to hallucinations, the impact of ill-formed prompts, prompts with ambiguous wording, incorrect grammar, or incomplete information, was relatively under explored. To address this, we introduce Multi-stage Prompt Refinement (MPR), a framework designed to systematically improve these ill-formed prompts across multiple stages. Each stage addresses specific errors such as punctuation, typographical mistakes, and misuse of key terms, using small language models (SLMs) fine-tuned for these tasks. MPR iteratively enhances the clarity of prompts with additional context and employs a self-reflection mechanism with ranking to prioritize the most relevant input. Experimental results on hallucination benchmarks show that prompts refined by MPR achieve over an 85~\% win rate compared to their original forms, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing hallucinations and improving LLM output accuracy. Interestingly, we reveal that MPR can be combined with existing post-hoc hallucination mitigation frameworks, further enhancing its versatility. MPR provides a lightweight and adaptable solution for enhancing LLM reliability across various domains.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Alignment: Surgical Fine-Tuning via Functional Layer Specialization in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing alignment techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), typically treat the model as a monolithic entity, applying uniform optimization pressure across all layers. This approach overlooks the functional specialization within the Transformer architecture, where different layers are known to handle distinct tasks from syntax to abstract reasoning. In this paper, we challenge this one-size-fits-all paradigm by introducing Hierarchical Alignment, a novel method that applies targeted DPO to distinct functional blocks of a model's layers: local (syntax), intermediate (logic), and global (factuality). Through a series of controlled experiments on state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen1.5-7B using LoRA for surgical fine-tuning, our results, evaluated by a powerful LLM-as-Judge, demonstrate significant and predictable improvements. Specifically, aligning the local layers (Local-Align) enhances grammatical fluency. More importantly, aligning the global layers (Global-Align) not only improves factual consistency as hypothesized but also proves to be the most effective strategy for enhancing logical coherence, outperforming all baselines. Critically, all hierarchical strategies successfully avoid the "alignment tax" observed in standard DPO, where gains in fluency come at the cost of degraded logical reasoning. These findings establish a more resource-efficient, controllable, and interpretable path for model alignment, highlighting the immense potential of shifting from monolithic optimization to structure-aware surgical fine-tuning to build more advanced and reliable LLMs.</description>

      <title>Generative AI and Firm Productivity: Field Experiments in Online Retail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We quantify the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) on firm productivity through a series of large-scale randomized field experiments involving millions of users and products at a leading cross-border online retail platform. Over six months in 2023-2024, GenAI-based enhancements were integrated into seven consumer-facing business workflows. We find that GenAI adoption significantly increases sales, with treatment effects ranging from 0\% to 16.3\%, depending on GenAI's marginal contribution relative to existing firm practices. Because inputs and prices were held constant across experimental arms, these gains map directly into total factor productivity improvements. Across the four GenAI applications with positive effects, the implied annual incremental value is approximately \$5 per consumer-an economically meaningful impact given the retailer's scale and the early stage of GenAI adoption. The primary mechanism operates through higher conversion rates, consistent with GenAI reducing frictions in the marketplace and improving consumer experience. We also document substantial heterogeneity: smaller and newer sellers, as well as less experienced consumers, exhibit disproportionately larger gains. Our findings provide novel, large-scale causal evidence on the productivity effects of GenAI in online retail, highlighting both its immediate value and broader potential.</description>

      <title>APCE: Adaptive Progressive Context Expansion for Long Context Processing</title>

Abstract: Deploying useful Long-Context Transformer Models (LCTMs) requires addressing two key challenges: (1) A growing memory footprint due to quadratic self-attention and linear KV-cache scaling in memory as sequence length increases; (2) the ContextRot phenomena where empirical evidence suggests that transformer architecture's performance degrades with increasing context length. Given the shared dependency on the input, a natural question arises: Can we surgically select the most important input chunks for processing to synergistically (a) reduce the memory footprint, and (b) mitigate the ContextRot effects? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative for long-context summarization tasks. We propose APCE as a context-aware solution to select the most important input chunks through low-dimensional semantic similarity matching with the current query. By directly operating on the input, APCE decouples from strict dependency on underlying hardware or CUDA environments, promising a compatible solution scalable to different deployment systems. Our empirical evaluations have demonstrated superior or on-par summarization performance for APCE compared to the full dense baseline using a fraction (50%-70%) of the input sequence resulting in KV-cache and self-attention memory efficiency improvements. We hope our findings inspire further research on context-aware efficiency solutions for LCTMs geared towards other relevant long-context tasks.</description>

      <title>Your VAR Model is Secretly an Efficient and Explainable Generative Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning tasks.</description>

      <title>MEASURE: Multi-scale Minimal Sufficient Representation Learning for Domain Generalization in Sleep Staging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders. However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS, our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The major challenge in today's computer vision scenario is the availability of good quality labeled data. In a field of study like image classification, where data is of utmost importance, we need to find more reliable methods which can overcome the scarcity of data to produce results comparable to previous benchmark results. In most cases, obtaining labeled data is very difficult because of the high cost of human labor and in some cases impossible. The purpose of this paper is to discuss Domain Adaptation and various methods to implement it. The main idea is to use a model trained on a particular dataset to predict on data from a different domain of the same kind, for example - a model trained on paintings of airplanes predicting on real images of airplanes</description>

      <title>Enhancing Neural Code Representation with Additional Context</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated program comprehension underpins many software engineering tasks, from code summarisation to clone detection. Recent deep learning models achieve strong results but typically rely on source code alone, overlooking contextual information such as version history or structural relationships. This limits their ability to capture how code evolves and operates. We conduct an empirical study on how enriching code representations with such contextual signals affects neural model performance on key comprehension tasks. Two downstream tasks, code clone detection and code summarisation, are evaluated using SeSaMe (1,679 Java methods) and CodeSearchNet (63,259 methods). Five representative models (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, CodeT5, PLBART, ASTNN) are fine-tuned under code-only and context-augmented settings. Results show that context generally improves performance: version history consistently boosts clone detection (e.g., CodeT5 +15.92% F1) and summarisation (e.g., GraphCodeBERT +5.56% METEOR), while call-graph effects vary by model and task. Combining multiple contexts yields further gains (up to +21.48% macro-F1). Human evaluation on 100 Java snippets confirms that context-augmented summaries are significantly preferred for Accuracy and Content Adequacy (p &lt;= 0.026; |delta| up to 0.55). These findings highlight the potential of contextual signals to enhance code comprehension and open new directions for optimising contextual encoding in neural SE models.</description>

      <title>An AI-Based Behavioral Health Safety Filter and Dataset for Identifying Mental Health Crises in Text-Based Conversations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models often mishandle psychiatric emergencies, offering harmful or inappropriate advice and enabling destructive behaviors. This study evaluated the Verily behavioral health safety filter (VBHSF) on two datasets: the Verily Mental Health Crisis Dataset containing 1,800 simulated messages and the NVIDIA Aegis AI Content Safety Dataset subsetted to 794 mental health-related messages. The two datasets were clinician-labelled and we evaluated performance using the clinician labels. Additionally, we carried out comparative performance analyses against two open source, content moderation guardrails: OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest and NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails. The VBHSF demonstrated, well-balanced performance on the Verily Mental Health Crisis Dataset v1.0, achieving high sensitivity (0.990) and specificity (0.992) in detecting any mental health crises. It achieved an F1-score of 0.939, sensitivity ranged from 0.917-0.992, and specificity was &gt;= 0.978 in identifying specific crisis categories. When evaluated against the NVIDIA Aegis AI Content Safety Dataset 2.0, VBHSF performance remained highly sensitive (0.982) and accuracy (0.921) with reduced specificity (0.859). When compared with the NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest guardrails, the VBHSF demonstrated superior performance metrics across both datasets, achieving significantly higher sensitivity in all cases (all p &lt; 0.001) and higher specificity relative to NVIDIA NeMo (p &lt; 0.001), but not to OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest (p = 0.094). NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest exhibited inconsistent performance across specific crisis types, with sensitivity for some categories falling below 0.10. Overall, the VBHSF demonstrated robust, generalizable performance that prioritizes sensitivity to minimize missed crises, a crucial feature for healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Deep Associations, High Creativity: A Simple yet Effective Metric for Evaluating Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs' creativity represents a crucial research domain, though challenges such as data contamination and costly human assessments often impede progress. Drawing inspiration from human creativity assessment, we propose PACE, asking LLMs to generate Parallel Association Chains to Evaluate their creativity. PACE minimizes the risk of data contamination and offers a straightforward, highly efficient evaluation, as evidenced by its strong correlation with Chatbot Arena Creative Writing rankings (Spearman's $\rho = 0.739$, $p &lt; 0.001$) across various proprietary and open-source models. A comparative analysis of associative creativity between LLMs and humans reveals that while high-performing LLMs achieve scores comparable to average human performance, professional humans consistently outperform LLMs. Furthermore, linguistic analysis reveals that both humans and LLMs exhibit a trend of decreasing concreteness in their associations, and humans demonstrating a greater diversity of associative patterns.</description>

      <title>Chimera: State Space Models Beyond Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning methods have become the standard approach for modeling diverse data such as sequences, images, and graphs. These methods rely on self-attention, which treats data as an unordered set of elements. This ignores the neighborhood structure or graph topology of the data and requires inductive biases--such as position embeddings in sequences and images, or random walks in graphs--to incorporate topology. However, designing such task-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects that hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly incorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for domain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which naturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any graph topology. Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance across language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7 points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph Benchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's efficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a linear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical relaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific heuristics. These results validate Chimera's core contribution and support the idea that data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Modality Gap: An Empirical Study on the Speech-Text Alignment Mechanism of Large Speech Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models (LSLMs) have demonstrated impressive conversational generation abilities, yet consistently fall short of traditional pipeline systems on semantic understanding benchmarks. In this work, we reveal through systematic experimentation that although LSLMs lose some text input performance after speech-text alignment training, the performance gap between speech and text inputs is more pronounced, which we refer to as the modality gap. To understand this gap, we analyze both coarse- and fine-grained text and speech representations. At the coarse-grained level, representations of speech and text in deeper layers are found to be increasingly aligned in direction (cosine similarity), while concurrently diverging in magnitude (Euclidean distance). We further find that representation similarity is strongly correlated with the modality gap. At the fine-grained level, a spontaneous token-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is observed. Based on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify token-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the modality gap. Building on these insights, we design targeted interventions on critical tokens through angle projection and length normalization. These strategies demonstrate the potential to improve correctness for speech inputs. Our study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of the modality gap and alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering both theoretical and methodological guidance for future optimization.</description>

      <title>SafeMT: Multi-turn Safety for Multimodal Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the widespread use of multi-modal Large Language models (MLLMs), safety issues have become a growing concern. Multi-turn dialogues, which are more common in everyday interactions, pose a greater risk than single prompts; however, existing benchmarks do not adequately consider this situation. To encourage the community to focus on the safety issues of these models in multi-turn dialogues, we introduce SafeMT, a benchmark that features dialogues of varying lengths generated from harmful queries accompanied by images. This benchmark consists of 10,000 samples in total, encompassing 17 different scenarios and four jailbreak methods. Additionally, we propose Safety Index (SI) to evaluate the general safety of MLLMs during conversations. We assess the safety of 17 models using this benchmark and discover that the risk of successful attacks on these models increases as the number of turns in harmful dialogues rises. This observation indicates that the safety mechanisms of these models are inadequate for recognizing the hazard in dialogue interactions. We propose a dialogue safety moderator capable of detecting malicious intent concealed within conversations and providing MLLMs with relevant safety policies. Experimental results from several open-source models indicate that this moderator is more effective in reducing multi-turn ASR compared to existed guard models.</description>

      <title>Credal Transformer: A Principled Approach for Quantifying and Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hallucinate, generating factually incorrect yet confident assertions. We argue this stems from the Transformer's Softmax function, which creates "Artificial Certainty" by collapsing ambiguous attention scores into a single probability distribution, discarding uncertainty information at each layer. To fix this, we introduce the Credal Transformer, which replaces standard attention with a Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM) based on evidential theory. CAM produces a "credal set" (a set of distributions) instead of a single attention vector, with the set's size directly measuring model uncertainty. We implement this by re-conceptualizing attention scores as evidence masses for a Dirichlet distribution: sufficient evidence recovers standard attention, while insufficient evidence yields a diffuse distribution, representing ambiguity. Empirically, the Credal Transformer identifies out-of-distribution inputs, quantifies ambiguity, and significantly reduces confident errors on unanswerable questions by abstaining. Our contribution is a new architecture to mitigate hallucinations and a design paradigm that integrates uncertainty quantification directly into the model, providing a foundation for more reliable AI.</description>

      <title>Budget-constrained Active Learning to Effectively De-censor Survival Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard supervised learners attempt to learn a model from a labeled dataset. Given a small set of labeled instances, and a pool of unlabeled instances, a budgeted learner can use its given budget to pay to acquire the labels of some unlabeled instances, which it can then use to produce a model. Here, we explore budgeted learning in the context of survival datasets, which include (right) censored instances, where we know only a lower bound on an instance's time-to-event. Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored instance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from (3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about one more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or perhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data collection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to uncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data collection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself. We provide both experimental and theoretical results for how to apply state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data and the respective limitations that exist in doing so. Our approach provides bounds and time complexity asymptotically equivalent to the standard active learning method BatchBALD. Moreover, empirical analysis on several survival tasks show that our model performs better than other potential approaches on several benchmarks.</description>

      <title>From Knowledge to Treatment: Large Language Model Assisted Biomedical Concept Representation for Drug Repurposing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug repurposing plays a critical role in accelerating treatment discovery, especially for complex and rare diseases. Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs), which encode rich clinical associations, have been widely adopted to support this task. However, existing methods largely overlook common-sense biomedical concept knowledge in real-world labs, such as mechanistic priors indicating that certain drugs are fundamentally incompatible with specific treatments. To address this gap, we propose LLaDR, a Large Language Model-assisted framework for Drug Repurposing, which improves the representation of biomedical concepts within KGs. Specifically, we extract semantically enriched treatment-related textual representations of biomedical entities from large language models (LLMs) and use them to fine-tune knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. By injecting treatment-relevant knowledge into KGE, LLaDR largely improves the representation of biomedical concepts, enhancing semantic understanding of under-studied or complex indications. Experiments based on benchmarks demonstrate that LLaDR achieves state-of-the-art performance across different scenarios, with case studies on Alzheimer's disease further confirming its robustness and effectiveness.

      <title>CompoDistill: Attention Distillation for Compositional Reasoning in Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity, making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative, which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model (teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Meta-Learning with Noisy Labels: Reweighting Dynamics and Theoretical Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning with noisy labels remains challenging because over-parameterized networks memorize corrupted supervision. Meta-learning-based sample reweighting mitigates this by using a small clean subset to guide training, yet its behavior and training dynamics lack theoretical understanding. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise and show that its training trajectory unfolds in three phases: (i) an alignment phase that amplifies examples consistent with a clean subset and suppresses conflicting ones; (ii) a filtering phase driving noisy example weights toward zero until the clean subset loss plateaus; and (iii) a post-filtering phase in which noise filtration becomes perturbation-sensitive. The mechanism is a similarity-weighted coupling between training and clean subset signals together with clean subset training loss contraction; in the post-filtering regime where the clean-subset loss is sufficiently small, the coupling term vanishes and meta-reweighting loses discriminatory power. Guided by this analysis, we propose a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting that integrates mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation, yielding more stable performance while avoiding expensive bi-level optimization. Across synthetic and real noisy-label benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms strong reweighting/selection baselines.</description>

      <title>DE3S: Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning for Medical Early Time-Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early time-series classification (ETSC) in medical applications is crucial for time-sensitive scenarios such as sepsis prediction in intensive care units (ICUs), where a large number of deaths are caused by delayed prediction. ETSC can significantly improve ICU resource utilization efficiency and healthcare precision. However, it faces conflicting goals of accuracy and earliness, with existing methods often trading one for the other, struggling to capture subtle early-stage patterns due to weak initial signals and class imbalance. The key to solve these challenges is to find shapelets, which are discriminative subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time-series classification. This paper proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning for Medical Early Time-Series Classification (DE3S), which introduces a novel Dual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework to figure out shapelets precisely through three innovations: (1) a comprehensive dual-enhancement strategy combines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal enhancement for robust representation learning, (2) an attention-score-based soft shapelet sparsification mechanism dynamically preserves discriminative patterns while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens, and (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts Network (MoE) and Inception modules fusion architecture where MoE performs local learning within shapelets and multi-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets. The framework employs weighted cross-entropy loss for class imbalance handling and demonstrates robustness on subject-consistency datasets. Extensive experiments on six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies confirming component efficacy.</description>

      <title>HALF: Harm-Aware LLM Fairness Evaluation Aligned with Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across high-impact domains, from clinical decision support and legal analysis to hiring and education, making fairness and bias evaluation before deployment critical. However, existing evaluations lack grounding in real-world scenarios and do not account for differences in harm severity, e.g., a biased decision in surgery should not be weighed the same as a stylistic bias in text summarization. To address this gap, we introduce HALF (Harm-Aware LLM Fairness), a deployment-aligned framework that assesses model bias in realistic applications and weighs the outcomes by harm severity. HALF organizes nine application domains into three tiers (Severe, Moderate, Mild) using a five-stage pipeline. Our evaluation results across eight LLMs show that (1) LLMs are not consistently fair across domains, (2) model size or performance do not guarantee fairness, and (3) reasoning models perform better in medical decision support but worse in education. We conclude that HALF exposes a clear gap between previous benchmarking success and deployment readiness.</description>

      <title>Analysing Moral Bias in Finetuned LLMs through Mechanistic Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to internalize human-like biases during finetuning, yet the mechanisms by which these biases manifest remain unclear. In this work, we investigated whether the well-known Knobe effect, a moral bias in intentionality judgements, emerges in finetuned LLMs and whether it can be traced back to specific components of the model. We conducted a Layer-Patching analysis across 3 open-weights LLMs and demonstrated that the bias is not only learned during finetuning but also localized in a specific set of layers. Surprisingly, we found that patching activations from the corresponding pretrained model into just a few critical layers is sufficient to eliminate the effect. Our findings offer new evidence that social biases in LLMs can be interpreted, localized, and mitigated through targeted interventions, without the need for model retraining.</description>

      <title>MoRA: On-the-fly Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation Framework for LLM-based Multi-Modal Molecular Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effectively integrating molecular graph structures with Large Language Models (LLMs) is a key challenge in drug discovery. Most existing multi-modal alignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or adding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main limitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular inputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural features; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to catastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In this paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an instance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule on-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA) that produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input molecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM, allowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular input, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction and molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation outperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative improvement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for quantum property prediction. The code is available at https://github.com/jk-sounds/MoRA.</description>

      <title>PromptLocate: Localizing Prompt Injection Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prompt injection attacks deceive a large language model into completing an attacker-specified task instead of its intended task by contaminating its input data with an injected prompt, which consists of injected instruction(s) and data. Localizing the injected prompt within contaminated data is crucial for post-attack forensic analysis and data recovery. Despite its growing importance, prompt injection localization remains largely unexplored. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing PromptLocate, the first method for localizing injected prompts. PromptLocate comprises three steps: (1) splitting the contaminated data into semantically coherent segments, (2) identifying segments contaminated by injected instructions, and (3) pinpointing segments contaminated by injected data. We show PromptLocate accurately localizes injected prompts across eight existing and eight adaptive attacks.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models for Reinforcement Learning: Foundations, Taxonomy, and Development</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs), as a leading class of generative models, offer key advantages for reinforcement learning (RL), including multi-modal expressiveness, stable training, and trajectory-level planning. This survey delivers a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of diffusion-based RL. We first provide an overview of RL, highlighting its challenges, and then introduce the fundamental concepts of DMs, investigating how they are integrated into RL frameworks to address key challenges in this research field. We establish a dual-axis taxonomy that organizes the field along two orthogonal dimensions: a function-oriented taxonomy that clarifies the roles DMs play within the RL pipeline, and a technique-oriented taxonomy that situates implementations across online versus offline learning regimes. We also provide a comprehensive examination of this progression from single-agent to multi-agent domains, thereby forming several frameworks for DM-RL integration and highlighting their practical utility. Furthermore, we outline several categories of successful applications of diffusion-based RL across diverse domains, discuss open research issues of current methodologies, and highlight key directions for future research to advance the field. Finally, we summarize the survey to identify promising future development directions. We are actively maintaining a GitHub repository (https://github.com/ChangfuXu/D4RL-FTD) for papers and other related resources to apply DMs for RL.</description>

      <title>Shallow Robustness, Deep Vulnerabilities: Multi-Turn Evaluation of Medical LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transitioning into medical clinical use, yet their reliability under realistic, multi-turn interactions remains poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks typically assess single-turn question answering under idealized conditions, overlooking the complexities of medical consultations where conflicting input, misleading context, and authority influence are common. We introduce MedQA-Followup, a framework for systematically evaluating multi-turn robustness in medical question answering. Our approach distinguishes between shallow robustness (resisting misleading initial context) and deep robustness (maintaining accuracy when answers are challenged across turns), while also introducing an indirect-direct axis that separates contextual framing (indirect) from explicit suggestion (direct). Using controlled interventions on the MedQA dataset, we evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs and find that while models perform reasonably well under shallow perturbations, they exhibit severe vulnerabilities in multi-turn settings, with accuracy dropping from 91.2% to as low as 13.5% for Claude Sonnet 4. Counterintuitively, indirect, context-based interventions are often more harmful than direct suggestions, yielding larger accuracy drops across models and exposing a significant vulnerability for clinical deployment. Further compounding analyses reveal model differences, with some showing additional performance drops under repeated interventions while others partially recovering or even improving. These findings highlight multi-turn robustness as a critical but underexplored dimension for safe and reliable deployment of medical LLMs.</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-Loop Bandwidth Estimation for Quality of Experience Optimization in Real-Time Video Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quality of experience (QoE) delivered by video conferencing systems is significantly influenced by accurately estimating the time-varying available bandwidth between the sender and receiver. Bandwidth estimation for real-time communications remains an open challenge due to rapidly evolving network architectures, increasingly complex protocol stacks, and the difficulty of defining QoE metrics that reliably improve user experience. In this work, we propose a deployed, human-in-the-loop, data-driven framework for bandwidth estimation to address these challenges. Our approach begins with training objective QoE reward models derived from subjective user evaluations to measure audio and video quality in real-time video conferencing systems. Subsequently, we collect roughly $1$M network traces with objective QoE rewards from real-world Microsoft Teams calls to curate a bandwidth estimation training dataset. We then introduce a novel distributional offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to train a neural-network-based bandwidth estimator aimed at improving QoE for users. Our real-world A/B test demonstrates that the proposed approach reduces the subjective poor call ratio by $11.41\%$ compared to the baseline bandwidth estimator. Furthermore, the proposed offline RL algorithm is benchmarked on D4RL tasks to demonstrate its generalization beyond bandwidth estimation.</description>

      <title>HiLoRA: Adaptive Hierarchical LoRA Routing for Training-Free Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely used technique for adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains, due to its modular design and broad availability on platforms such as HuggingFace. This availability has motivated efforts to reuse existing LoRAs for domain generalization.
  However, existing methods often rely on explicit task labels or additional training, which are impractical for deployment. Moreover, they typically activate a fixed number of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy or insufficiency that degrade performance.
  In this paper, we propose \texttt{HiLoRA}, a training-free framework that performs adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools. Drawing on structural properties of LoRA, we define rank-one components (ROCs), in which each rank parameter is regarded as an independent unit. For a given input sequence, \texttt{HiLoRA} first adaptively selects a subset of LoRAs and determines their ROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level. At the token level, it further refines routing by activating only the most informative ROCs.
  We further provide theoretical guarantees that \texttt{HiLoRA} selects the most relevant LoRAs with high probability.
  Extensive experiments show that \texttt{HiLoRA} achieves substantial improvements in domain generalization, with accuracy gains of up to {\small $55\%$} over state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable inference throughput.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of auditory attention decoding (AAD) based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals offers the possibility EEG-driven target speaker extraction. However, how to effectively utilize the target-speaker common information between EEG and speech remains an unresolved problem. In this paper, we propose a model for brain-controlled speaker extraction, which utilizes the EEG recorded from the listener to extract the target speech. In order to effectively extract information from EEG signals, we derive multi-scale time--frequency features and further incorporate cortical topological structures that are selectively engaged during the task. Moreover, to effectively exploit the non-Euclidean structure of EEG signals and capture their global features, the graph convolutional networks and self-attention mechanism are used in the EEG encoder. In addition, to make full use of the fused EEG and speech feature and preserve global context and capture speech rhythm and prosody, we introduce MossFormer2 which combines MossFormer and RNN-Free Recurrent as separator. Experimental results on both the public Cocktail Party and KUL dataset in this paper show that our TFGA-Net model significantly outper-forms the state-of-the-art method in certain objective evaluation metrics.

      <description>arXiv:2510.12278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address a novel staff allocation problem that arises in the organization of collaborators among multiple school sites and educational levels. The problem emerges from a real case study in a public school in Calabria, Italy, where staff members must be distributed across kindergartens, primary, and secondary schools under constraints of availability, competencies, and fairness. To tackle this problem, we develop an optimization model and investigate a solution approach based on quantum annealing. Our computational experiments on real-world data show that quantum annealing is capable of producing balanced assignments in short runtimes. These results provide evidence of the practical applicability of quantum optimization methods in educational scheduling and, more broadly, in complex resource allocation tasks.</description>

      <title>Chinese ModernBERT with Whole-Word Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Encoder-only Transformers have advanced along three axes -- architecture, data, and systems -- yielding Pareto gains in accuracy, speed, and memory efficiency. Yet these improvements have not fully transferred to Chinese, where tokenization and morphology differ markedly from English. We introduce Chinese ModernBERT, a from-scratch Chinese encoder that couples: (i) a hardware-aware 32k BPE vocabulary tailored to frequent Chinese affixes/compounds, lowering the embedding budget; (ii) whole-word masking (WWM) with a dynamic masking curriculum (30% -&gt; 15%) to align task difficulty with training progress; (iii) a two-stage pre-training pipeline that extends the native context from 1,024 to 8,192 tokens using RoPE and alternating local/global attention; and (iv) a damped-cosine learning-rate schedule for stable long-horizon optimization. We pre-train on ~1.2T Chinese tokens from CCI3-HQ, CCI4 (Chinese), and Cosmopedia-Chinese. On CLUE, Chinese ModernBERT is competitive with strong Chinese encoders under a unified fine-tuning protocol. Under bf16 it achieves high long-sequence throughput while maintaining strong short-sequence speed, reflecting benefits from budget allocation and attention design. To probe retrieval-oriented quality, we add a small amount of open contrastive data: fine-tuning on SimCLUE (~3M pairs) improves further when adding T2Ranking (~2M), reaching 0.505 (Pearson) / 0.537 (Spearman) on the SimCLUE test set. Under this open-data setting, Chinese ModernBERT surpasses Qwen-0.6B-embedding on SimCLUE, suggesting a clear scaling path for STS with additional curated pairs. We will release tokenizer and weights to facilitate reproducible research.</description>

      <title>Deep SPI: Safe Policy Improvement via World Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe policy improvement (SPI) offers theoretical control over policy updates, yet existing guarantees largely concern offline, tabular reinforcement learning (RL). We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep" analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Causal Inspired Multi Modal Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal recommender systems enhance personalized recommendations in e-commerce and online advertising by integrating visual, textual, and user-item interaction data. However, existing methods often overlook two critical biases: (i) modal confounding, where latent factors (e.g., brand style or product category) simultaneously drive multiple modalities and influence user preference, leading to spurious feature-preference associations; (ii) interaction bias, where genuine user preferences are mixed with noise from exposure effects and accidental clicks. To address these challenges, we propose a Causal-inspired multimodal Recommendation framework. Specifically, we introduce a dual-channel cross-modal diffusion module to identify hidden modal confounders, utilize back-door adjustment with hierarchical matching and vector-quantized codebooks to block confounding paths, and apply front-door adjustment combined with causal topology reconstruction to build a deconfounded causal subgraph. Extensive experiments on three real-world e-commerce datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining strong interpretability.</description>

      <title>Simple Projection Variants Improve ColBERT Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-vector dense retrieval methods like ColBERT systematically use a single-layer linear projection to reduce the dimensionality of individual vectors. In this study, we explore the implications of the MaxSim operator on the gradient flows of the training of multi-vector models and show that such a simple linear projection has inherent, if non-critical, limitations in this setting. We then discuss the theoretical improvements that could result from replacing this single-layer projection with well-studied alternative feedforward linear networks (FFN), such as deeper, non-linear FFN blocks, GLU blocks, and skip-connections, could alleviate these limitations. Through the design and systematic evaluation of alternate projection blocks, we show that better-designed final projections positively impact the downstream performance of ColBERT models. We highlight that many projection variants outperform the original linear projections, with the best-performing variants increasing average performance on a range of retrieval benchmarks across domains by over 2 NDCG@10 points. We then conduct further exploration on the individual parameters of these projections block in order to understand what drives this empirical performance, highlighting the particular importance of upscaled intermediate projections and residual connections. As part of these ablation studies, we show that numerous suboptimal projection variants still outperform the traditional single-layer projection across multiple benchmarks, confirming our hypothesis. Finally, we observe that this effect is consistent across random seeds, further confirming that replacing the linear layer of ColBERT models is a robust, drop-in upgrade.</description>

      <title>Finite-time Convergence Analysis of Actor-Critic with Evolving Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many popular practical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms employ evolving reward functions-through techniques such as reward shaping, entropy regularization, or curriculum learning-yet their theoretical foundations remain underdeveloped. This paper provides the first finite-time convergence analysis of a single-timescale actor-critic algorithm in the presence of an evolving reward function under Markovian sampling. We consider a setting where the reward parameters may change at each time step, affecting both policy optimization and value estimation. Under standard assumptions, we derive non-asymptotic bounds for both actor and critic errors. Our result shows that an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate is achievable, matching the best-known rate for static rewards, provided the reward parameters evolve slowly enough. This rate is preserved when the reward is updated via a gradient-based rule with bounded gradient and on the same timescale as the actor and critic, offering a theoretical foundation for many popular RL techniques. As a secondary contribution, we introduce a novel analysis of distribution mismatch under Markovian sampling, improving the best-known rate by a factor of $\log^2T$ in the static-reward case.</description>

      <title>(R)evolution of Programming: Vibe Coding as a Post-Coding Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), particularly large language models, have introduced new possibilities for software development practices. In our paper we investigate the emerging Vibe Coding (VC) paradigm that emphasizes intuitive, affect-driven, and improvisational interactions between developers and AI systems. Building upon the discourse of End-User Development (EUD), we explore how VC diverges from conventional programming approaches such as those supported by tools like GitHub Copilot. Through five semi-structured interview sessions with ten experienced software practitioners, we identify five thematic dimensions: creativity, sustainability, the future of programming, collaboration, and criticism. Our analysis conceptualizes VC within the metaphor of co-drifting, contrasting it with the prevalent co-piloting perspective of AI-assisted development. We argue that VC reconfigures the developers role, blurring boundaries between professional and non-developers. While VC enables novel forms of expression and rapid prototyping, it also introduces challenges regarding reproducibility, scalability, and inclusivity. We propose that VC represents a meaningful shift in programming culture, warranting further investigation within human-computer interaction (HCI) and software engineering research.</description>

      <title>LLM-REVal: Can We Trust LLM Reviewers Yet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has inspired researchers to integrate them extensively into the academic workflow, potentially reshaping how research is practiced and reviewed. While previous studies highlight the potential of LLMs in supporting research and peer review, their dual roles in the academic workflow and the complex interplay between research and review bring new risks that remain largely underexplored. In this study, we focus on how the deep integration of LLMs into both peer-review and research processes may influence scholarly fairness, examining the potential risks of using LLMs as reviewers by simulation. This simulation incorporates a research agent, which generates papers and revises, alongside a review agent, which assesses the submissions. Based on the simulation results, we conduct human annotations and identify pronounced misalignment between LLM-based reviews and human judgments: (1) LLM reviewers systematically inflate scores for LLM-authored papers, assigning them markedly higher scores than human-authored ones; (2) LLM reviewers persistently underrate human-authored papers with critical statements (e.g., risk, fairness), even after multiple revisions. Our analysis reveals that these stem from two primary biases in LLM reviewers: a linguistic feature bias favoring LLM-generated writing styles, and an aversion toward critical statements. These results highlight the risks and equity concerns posed to human authors and academic research if LLMs are deployed in the peer review cycle without adequate caution. On the other hand, revisions guided by LLM reviews yield quality gains in both LLM-based and human evaluations, illustrating the potential of the LLMs-as-reviewers for early-stage researchers and enhancing low-quality papers.</description>

      <title>Deep Attention-guided Adaptive Subsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance, these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks, not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive. Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical conditions.</description>

      <title>LiteVPNet: A Lightweight Network for Video Encoding Control in Quality-Critical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, video workflows in the cinema production ecosystem have presented new use cases for video streaming technology. These new workflows, e.g. in On-set Virtual Production, present the challenge of requiring precise quality control and energy efficiency. Existing approaches to transcoding often fall short of these requirements, either due to a lack of quality control or computational overhead. To fill this gap, we present a lightweight neural network (LiteVPNet) for accurately predicting Quantisation Parameters for NVENC AV1 encoders that achieve a specified VMAF score. We use low-complexity features, including bitstream characteristics, video complexity measures, and CLIP-based semantic embeddings. Our results demonstrate that LiteVPNet achieves mean VMAF errors below 1.2 points across a wide range of quality targets. Notably, LiteVPNet achieves VMAF errors within 2 points for over 87% of our test corpus, c.f. approx 61% with state-of-the-art methods. LiteVPNet's performance across various quality regions highlights its applicability for enhancing high-value content transport and streaming for more energy-efficient, high-quality media experiences.</description>

      <title>Phenome-Wide Multi-Omics Integration Uncovers Distinct Archetypes of Human Aging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aging is a highly complex and heterogeneous process that progresses at different rates across individuals, making biological age (BA) a more accurate indicator of physiological decline than chronological age. While previous studies have built aging clocks using single-omics data, they often fail to capture the full molecular complexity of human aging. In this work, we leveraged the Human Phenotype Project, a large-scale cohort of 12,000 adults aged 30--70 years, with extensive longitudinal profiling that includes clinical, behavioral, environmental, and multi-omics datasets -- spanning transcriptomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and the microbiome. By employing advanced machine learning frameworks capable of modeling nonlinear biological dynamics, we developed and rigorously validated a multi-omics aging clock that robustly predicts diverse health outcomes and future disease risk. Unsupervised clustering of the integrated molecular profiles from multi-omics uncovered distinct biological subtypes of aging, revealing striking heterogeneity in aging trajectories and pinpointing pathway-specific alterations associated with different aging patterns. These findings demonstrate the power of multi-omics integration to decode the molecular landscape of aging and lay the groundwork for personalized healthspan monitoring and precision strategies to prevent age-related diseases.</description>

      <title>Tokenization Disparities as Infrastructure Bias: How Subword Systems Create Inequities in LLM Access and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tokenization disparities pose a significant barrier to achieving equitable access to artificial intelligence across linguistically diverse populations. This study conducts a large-scale cross-linguistic evaluation of tokenization efficiency in over 200 languages to systematically quantify computational inequities in large language models (LLMs). Using a standardized experimental framework, we applied consistent preprocessing and normalization protocols, followed by uniform tokenization through the tiktoken library across all language samples. Comprehensive tokenization statistics were collected using established evaluation metrics, including Tokens Per Sentence (TPS) and Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC), benchmarked against English baselines. Our cross-linguistic analysis reveals substantial and systematic disparities: Latin-script languages consistently exhibit higher tokenization efficiency, while non-Latin and morphologically complex languages incur significantly greater token inflation, often 3-5 times higher RTC ratios. These inefficiencies translate into increased computational costs and reduced effective context utilization for underrepresented languages. Overall, the findings highlight structural inequities in current AI systems, where speakers of low-resource and non-Latin languages face disproportionate computational disadvantages. Future research should prioritize the development of linguistically informed tokenization strategies and adaptive vocabulary construction methods that incorporate typological diversity, ensuring more inclusive and computationally equitable multilingual AI systems.</description>

      <title>Low-Field Magnetic Resonance Image Quality Enhancement using a Conditional Flow Matching Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods. These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.</description>

      <title>A Function Centric Perspective On Flat and Sharp Minima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation), calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.</description>

      <title>When Personalization Tricks Detectors: The Feature-Inversion Trap in Machine-Generated Text Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have grown more powerful in language generation, producing fluent text and even imitating personal style. Yet, this ability also heightens the risk of identity impersonation. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has examined personalized machine-generated text (MGT) detection. In this paper, we introduce \dataset, the first benchmark for evaluating detector robustness in personalized settings, built from literary and blog texts paired with their LLM-generated imitations. Our experimental results demonstrate large performance gaps across detectors in personalized settings: some state-of-the-art models suffer significant drops. We attribute this limitation to the \textit{feature-inversion trap}, where features that are discriminative in general domains become inverted and misleading when applied to personalized text. Based on this finding, we propose \method, a simple and reliable way to predict detector performance changes in personalized settings. \method identifies latent directions corresponding to inverted features and constructs probe datasets that differ primarily along these features to evaluate detector dependence. Our experiments show that \method can accurately predict both the direction and the magnitude of post-transfer changes, showing 85\% correlation with the actual performance gaps. We hope that this work will encourage further research on personalized text detection.</description>

      <title>A Text-Image Fusion Method with Data Augmentation Capabilities for Referring Medical Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data, especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation. However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/11yxk/MedSeg_EarlyFusion.</description>

      <title>PubSub-VFL: Towards Efficient Two-Party Split Learning in Heterogeneous Environments via Publisher/Subscriber Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital economy, data collaboration between organizations has become a well-established business model, driving the growth of various industries. However, privacy concerns make direct data sharing impractical. To address this, Two-Party Split Learning (a.k.a. Vertical Federated Learning (VFL)) has emerged as a promising solution for secure collaborative learning. Despite its advantages, this architecture still suffers from low computational resource utilization and training efficiency. Specifically, its synchronous dependency design increases training latency, while resource and data heterogeneity among participants further hinder efficient computation. To overcome these challenges, we propose PubSub-VFL, a novel VFL paradigm with a Publisher/Subscriber architecture optimized for two-party collaborative learning with high computational efficiency. PubSub-VFL leverages the decoupling capabilities of the Pub/Sub architecture and the data parallelism of the parameter server architecture to design a hierarchical asynchronous mechanism, reducing training latency and improving system efficiency. Additionally, to mitigate the training imbalance caused by resource and data heterogeneity, we formalize an optimization problem based on participants' system profiles, enabling the selection of optimal hyperparameters while preserving privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis to demonstrate that PubSub-VFL achieves stable convergence and is compatible with security protocols such as differential privacy. Extensive case studies on five benchmark datasets further validate its effectiveness, showing that, compared to state-of-the-art baselines, PubSub-VFL not only accelerates training by $2 \sim 7\times$ without compromising accuracy, but also achieves a computational resource utilization rate of up to 91.07%.</description>

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to learn causal relationships between variables from targeted data, making it a fundamental task in machine learning. However, causal discovery algorithms often rely on unverifiable causal assumptions, which are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world data, thereby limiting the broad application of causal discovery in practical scenarios. Inspired by these considerations, this work extensively benchmarks the empirical performance of various mainstream causal discovery algorithms, which assume i.i.d. data, under eight model assumption violations. Our experimental results show that differentiable causal discovery methods exhibit robustness under the metrics of Structural Hamming Distance and Structural Intervention Distance of the inferred graphs in commonly used challenging scenarios, except for scale variation. We also provide the theoretical explanations for the performance of differentiable causal discovery methods. Finally, our work aims to comprehensively benchmark the performance of recent differentiable causal discovery methods under model assumption violations, and provide the standard for reasonable evaluation of causal discovery, as well as to further promote its application in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>BoN Appetit Team at LeWiDi-2025: Best-of-N Test-time Scaling Can Not Stomach Annotation Disagreements (Yet)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-time scaling is a family of techniques to improve LLM outputs at inference time by performing extra computation. To the best of our knowledge, test-time scaling has been limited to domains with verifiably correct answers, like mathematics and coding. We transfer test-time scaling to the LeWiDi-2025 tasks to evaluate annotation disagreements. We experiment with three test-time scaling methods: two benchmark algorithms (Model Averaging and Majority Voting), and a Best-of-N sampling method. The two benchmark methods improve LLM performance consistently on the LeWiDi tasks, but the Best-of-N method does not. Our experiments suggest that the Best-of-N method does not currently transfer from mathematics to LeWiDi tasks, and we analyze potential reasons for this gap.</description>

      <title>Unconditional Human Motion and Shape Generation via Balanced Score-Based Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space normalization and analytically derived weightings for the standard L2 score-matching loss, while generating both motion and shape directly, thereby avoiding slow post hoc shape recovery from joints. We build the method step by step, with a clear theoretical motivation for each component, and provide targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each proposed addition in isolation.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Real-Time Preprocessing Methods in AI-Based ECG Signal Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing popularity of portable ECG systems and the growing demand for privacy-compliant, energy-efficient real-time analysis require new approaches to signal processing at the point of data acquisition. In this context, the edge domain is acquiring increasing importance, as it not only reduces latency times, but also enables an increased level of data security. The FACE project aims to develop an innovative machine learning solution for analysing long-term electrocardiograms that synergistically combines the strengths of edge and cloud computing. In this thesis, various pre-processing steps of ECG signals are analysed with regard to their applicability in the project. The selection of suitable methods in the edge area is based in particular on criteria such as energy efficiency, processing capability and real-time capability.</description>

      <title>Reasoning in the Dark: Interleaved Vision-Text Reasoning in Latent Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information, enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text. Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR), which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase of over 5 times compared to existing approaches.

      <title>SMILE: SeMantic Ids Enhanced CoLd Item Representation for Click-through Rate Prediction in E-commerce SEarch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of modern search and recommendation platforms, insufficient collaborative information of cold-start items exacerbates the Matthew effect of existing platform items, challenging platform diversity and becoming a longstanding issue. Existing methods align items' side content with collaborative information to transfer collaborative signals from high-popularity items to cold-start items. However, these methods fail to account for the asymmetry between collaboration and content, nor the fine-grained differences among items. To address these issues, we propose SMILE, an item representation enhancement approach based on fused alignment of semantic IDs. Specifically, we use RQ-OPQ encoding to quantize item content and collaborative information, followed by a two-step alignment: RQ encoding transfers shared collaborative signals across items, while OPQ encoding learns differentiated information of items. Comprehensive offline experiments on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate superiority of SMILE, and rigorous online A/B tests confirm statistically significant improvements: item CTR +1.66%, buyers +1.57%, and order volume +2.17%.</description>

      <title>StyleDecipher: Robust and Explainable Detection of LLM-Generated Texts with Stylistic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into open-domain writing, detecting machine-generated text has become a critical task for ensuring content authenticity and trust. Existing approaches rely on statistical discrepancies or model-specific heuristics to distinguish between LLM-generated and human-written text. However, these methods struggle in real-world scenarios due to limited generalization, vulnerability to paraphrasing, and lack of explainability, particularly when facing stylistic diversity or hybrid human-AI authorship. In this work, we propose StyleDecipher, a robust and explainable detection framework that revisits LLM-generated text detection using combined feature extractors to quantify stylistic differences. By jointly modeling discrete stylistic indicators and continuous stylistic representations derived from semantic embeddings, StyleDecipher captures distinctive style-level divergences between human and LLM outputs within a unified representation space. This framework enables accurate, explainable, and domain-agnostic detection without requiring access to model internals or labeled segments. Extensive experiments across five diverse domains, including news, code, essays, reviews, and academic abstracts, demonstrate that StyleDecipher consistently achieves state-of-the-art in-domain accuracy. Moreover, in cross-domain evaluations, it surpasses existing baselines by up to 36.30%, while maintaining robustness against adversarial perturbations and mixed human-AI content. Further qualitative and quantitative analysis confirms that stylistic signals provide explainable evidence for distinguishing machine-generated text.

      <title>Rethinking Knowledge Distillation: A Data Dependent Regulariser With a Negative Asymmetric Payoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation is often considered a compression mechanism when judged on the resulting student's accuracy and loss, yet its functional impact is poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the compression capacity of knowledge distillation and the resulting knowledge transfer from a functional perspective, decoupling compression from architectural reduction, which provides an improved understanding of knowledge distillation. We employ hypothesis testing, controls, and random control distillation to understand knowledge transfer mechanisms across data modalities. To rigorously test the breadth and limits of our analyses, we explore multiple distillation variants and analyse distillation scaling laws across model sizes. Our findings demonstrate that, while there is statistically significant knowledge transfer in some modalities and architectures, the extent of this transfer is less pronounced than anticipated, even under conditions designed to maximise knowledge sharing. Notably, in cases of significant knowledge transfer, we identify a consistent and severe asymmetric transfer of negative knowledge to the student, raising safety concerns in knowledge distillation applications. Across 12 experimental setups, 9 architectures, and 7 datasets, our findings show that knowledge distillation functions less as a compression mechanism and more as a data-dependent regulariser with a negative asymmetric payoff.</description>

      <title>Learning-To-Measure: In-context Active Feature Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is a sequential decision-making problem where the goal is to improve model performance for test instances by adaptively selecting which features to acquire. In practice, AFA methods often learn from retrospective data with systematic missingness in the features and limited task-specific labels. Most prior work addresses acquisition for a single predetermined task, limiting scalability. To address this limitation, we formalize the meta-AFA problem, where the goal is to learn acquisition policies across various tasks. We introduce Learning-to-Measure (L2M), which consists of i) reliable uncertainty quantification over unseen tasks, and ii) an uncertainty-guided greedy feature acquisition agent that maximizes conditional mutual information. We demonstrate a sequence-modeling or autoregressive pre-training approach that underpins reliable uncertainty quantification for tasks with arbitrary missingness. L2M operates directly on datasets with retrospective missingness and performs the meta-AFA task in-context, eliminating per-task retraining. Across synthetic and real-world tabular benchmarks, L2M matches or surpasses task-specific baselines, particularly under scarce labels and high missingness.</description>

      <title>Designing Tools with Control Confidence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prehistoric humans invented stone tools for specialized tasks by not just maximizing the tool's immediate goal-completion accuracy, but also increasing their confidence in the tool for later use under similar settings. This factor contributed to the increased robustness of the tool, i.e., the least performance deviations under environmental uncertainties. However, the current autonomous tool design frameworks solely rely on performance optimization, without considering the agent's confidence in tool use for repeated use. Here, we take a step towards filling this gap by i) defining an optimization framework for task-conditioned autonomous hand tool design for robots, where ii) we introduce a neuro-inspired control confidence term into the optimization routine that helps the agent to design tools with higher robustness. Through rigorous simulations using a robotic arm, we show that tools designed with control confidence as the objective function are more robust to environmental uncertainties during tool use than a pure accuracy-driven objective. We further show that adding control confidence to the objective function for tool design provides a balance between the robustness and goal accuracy of the designed tools under control perturbations. Finally, we show that our CMAES-based evolutionary optimization strategy for autonomous tool design outperforms other state-of-the-art optimizers by designing the optimal tool within the fewest iterations.

      <title>Laminar: A Scalable Asynchronous RL Post-Training Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs) is now scaling to large clusters and running for extended durations to enhance model reasoning performance. However, the scalability of existing RL frameworks is limited, as extreme long-tail skewness in RL trajectory generation causes severe GPU underutilization. Current asynchronous RL systems attempt to mitigate this, but they rely on global weight synchronization between the actor and all rollouts, which creates a rigid model update schedule. This global synchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution of trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency. Our key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep through trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each trajectory independently. We propose Laminar, a scalable and robust RL post-training system built on a fully decoupled architecture. First, we replace global updates with a tier of relay workers acting as a distributed parameter service. This enables asynchronous and fine-grained weight synchronization, allowing rollouts to pull the latest weight anytime without stalling the actor's training loop. Second, a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates long-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts, maximizing generation throughput. The fully decoupled design also isolates failures, ensuring robustness for long-running jobs. Our evaluation on a 1024-GPU cluster shows that Laminar achieves up to 5.48$\times$ training throughput speedup over state-of-the-art systems, while reducing model convergence time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A growing trend in modern data analysis is the integration of data management with learning, guided by accuracy, latency, and cost requirements. In practice, applications draw data of different formats from many sources. In the meanwhile, the objectives and budgets change over time. Existing systems handle these applications across databases, analysis libraries, and tuning services. Such fragmentation leads to complex user interaction, limited adaptability, suboptimal performance, and poor extensibility across components. To address these challenges, we present Aixel, a unified, adaptive, and extensible system for AI-powered data analysis. The system organizes work across four layers: application, task, model, and data. The task layer provides a declarative interface to capture user intent, which is parsed into an executable operator plan. An optimizer compiles and schedules this plan to meet specified goals in accuracy, latency, and cost. The task layer coordinates the execution of data and model operators, with built-in support for reuse and caching to improve efficiency. The model layer offers versioned storage for index, metadata, tensors, and model artifacts. It supports adaptive construction, task-aligned drift detection, and safe updates that reuse shared components. The data layer provides unified data management capabilities, including indexing, constraint-aware discovery, task-aligned selection, and comprehensive feature management. With the above designed layers, Aixel delivers a user friendly, adaptive, efficient, and extensible system.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Pattern Matters: Learning to Reason without Human Rationales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities under the widely adopted SFT+RLVR paradigm, which first performs Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on human-annotated reasoning trajectories (rationales) to establish initial reasoning behaviors, then applies Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize the model using verifiable signals without golden rationales. However, annotating high-quality rationales for the SFT stage remains prohibitively expensive. This paper investigates when and how rationale annotation costs can be substantially reduced without compromising reasoning performance. We identify a broad class of problems, termed patterned reasoning tasks, where reasoning follows a fixed, procedural strategy consistent across instances. Although instances vary in content such as domain knowledge, factual information, or numeric values, the solution derives from applying a shared reasoning pattern. We argue that the success of SFT+RLVR on such tasks primarily stems from its ability to enable models to internalize these reasoning patterns. Using numerical semantic matching as a representative task, we provide both causal and behavioral evidence showing that reasoning patterns rather than the quantity or quality of rationales are the key determinant of performance. Building on these insights, we propose Pattern-Aware LLMs as Rationale AnnOtators (PARO), a simple yet effective framework that enables LLMs to generate rationales aligned with task-specific reasoning patterns without requiring human rationale annotations. Experiments show that PARO-generated rationales achieve comparable SFT+RLVR performance to human rationales that are 10 times larger. These results suggest that large-scale human rationale annotations can be replaced with LLM-based automatic annotations requiring only limited human supervision over reasoning patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose SG-XDEAT (Sparsity-Guided Cross Dimensional and Cross-Encoding Attention with Target Aware Conditioning), a novel framework designed for supervised learning on tabular data. At its core, SG-XDEAT employs a dual-stream encoder that decomposes each input feature into two parallel representations: a raw value stream and a target-conditioned (label-aware) stream. These dual representations are then propagated through a hierarchical stack of attention-based modules. SG-XDEAT integrates three key components: (i) Cross-Dimensional self-attention, which captures intra-view dependencies among features within each stream; (ii) Cross-Encoding self-attention, which enables bidirectional interaction between raw and target-aware representations; and (iii) an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) mechanism, which dynamically suppresses low-utility tokens by driving their attention weights toward zero--thereby mitigating the impact of noise. Empirical results on multiple public benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, confirming that jointly modeling raw and target-aware views--while adaptively filtering noise--yields a more robust deep tabular learner.</description>

Yet our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2) using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that, compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500) and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from $5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.</description>

      <title>From Delegates to Trustees: How Optimizing for Long-Term Interests Shapes Bias and Alignment in LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising accuracy in predicting survey responses and policy preferences, which has increased interest in their potential to represent human interests in various domains. Most existing research has focused on behavioral cloning, effectively evaluating how well models reproduce individuals' expressed preferences. Drawing on theories of political representation, we highlight an underexplored design trade-off: whether AI systems should act as delegates, mirroring expressed preferences, or as trustees, exercising judgment about what best serves an individual's interests. This trade-off is closely related to issues of LLM sycophancy, where models can encourage behavior or validate beliefs that may be aligned with a user's short-term preferences, but is detrimental to their long-term interests. Through a series of experiments simulating votes on various policy issues in the U.S. context, we apply a temporal utility framework that weighs short and long-term interests (simulating a trustee role) and compare voting outcomes to behavior-cloning models (simulating a delegate). We find that trustee-style predictions weighted toward long-term interests produce policy decisions that align more closely with expert consensus on well-understood issues, but also show greater bias toward models' default stances on topics lacking clear agreement. These findings reveal a fundamental trade-off in designing AI systems to represent human interests. Delegate models better preserve user autonomy but may diverge from well-supported policy positions, while trustee models can promote welfare on well-understood issues yet risk paternalism and bias on subjective topics.</description>

      <title>DiffEM: Learning from Corrupted Data with Diffusion Models via Expectation Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM) from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image reconstruction tasks.</description>

      <title>Who is a Better Matchmaker? Human vs. Algorithmic Judge Assignment in a High-Stakes Startup Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is growing interest in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to automate and support complex decision-making tasks. However, it remains unclear how algorithms compare to human judgment in contexts requiring semantic understanding and domain expertise. We examine this in the context of the judge assignment problem, matching submissions to suitably qualified judges. Specifically, we tackled this problem at the Harvard President's Innovation Challenge, the university's premier venture competition awarding over \$500,000 to student and alumni startups. This represents a real-world environment where high-quality judge assignment is essential. We developed an AI-based judge-assignment algorithm, Hybrid Lexical-Semantic Similarity Ensemble (HLSE), and deployed it at the competition. We then evaluated its performance against human expert assignments using blinded match-quality scores from judges on $309$ judge-venture pairs. Using a Mann-Whitney U statistic based test, we found no statistically significant difference in assignment quality between the two approaches ($AUC=0.48, p=0.40$); on average, algorithmic matches are rated $3.90$ and manual matches $3.94$ on a 5-point scale, where 5 indicates an excellent match. Furthermore, manual assignments that previously required a full week could be automated in several hours by the algorithm during deployment. These results demonstrate that HLSE achieves human-expert-level matching quality while offering greater scalability and efficiency, underscoring the potential of AI-driven solutions to support and enhance human decision-making for judge assignment in high-stakes settings.</description>

      <title>Generation Space Size: Understanding and Calibrating Open-Endedness of LLM Generations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different open-ended generation tasks require different degrees of output diversity. However, current LLMs are often miscalibrated. They collapse to overly homogeneous outputs for creative tasks and hallucinate diverse but incorrect responses for factual tasks. We argue that these two failure modes are unified by, and can both be addressed by, the notion of effective generation space size (GSS) -- the set of semantically distinct outputs a model considers for a prompt. We present GSSBench, a task suite of prompt pairs with ground-truth GSS relationships to assess different metrics and understand where models diverge from desired behavior. We find that hallucination detection metrics, particularly EigenScore, consistently outperform standard diversity and uncertainty quantification metrics, while using only model internals, providing interpretable insights into a model's internal task representations. We demonstrate three applications of GSS: (1) detecting prompt ambiguity and predicting clarification questions for better grounding, (2) interpreting overthinking and underthinking in reasoning models, and (3) steering models to expand their generation space to yield high-quality and diverse outputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the topological signatures of ReLU neural network activation patterns. We consider feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation functions and analyze the polytope decomposition of the feature space induced by the network. Mainly, we investigate how the Fiedler partition of the dual graph and show that it appears to correlate with the decision boundary -- in the case of binary classification. Additionally, we compute the homology of the cellular decomposition -- in a regression task -- to draw similar patterns in behavior between the training loss and polyhedral cell-count, as the model is trained.</description>

      <title>Beyond Postconditions: Can Large Language Models infer Formal Contracts for Automatic Software Verification?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic software verifiers have become increasingly effective at the task of checking software against (formal) specifications. Yet, their adoption in practice has been hampered by the lack of such specifications in real world code. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in inferring formal postconditions from natural language hints embedded in code such as function names, comments or documentation. Using the generated postconditions as specifications in a subsequent verification, however, often leads verifiers to suggest invalid inputs, hinting at potential issues that ultimately turn out to be false alarms.
  To address this, we revisit the problem of specification inference from natural language in the context of automatic software verification. In the process, we introduce NL2Contract, the task of employing LLMs to translate informal natural language into formal functional contracts, consisting of postconditions as well as preconditions. We introduce metrics to validate and compare different NL2Contract approaches, using soundness, bug discriminative power of the generated contracts and their usability in the context of automatic software verification as key metrics. We evaluate NL2Contract with different LLMs and compare it to the task of postcondition generation nl2postcond. Our evaluation shows that (1) LLMs are generally effective at generating functional contracts sound for all possible inputs, (2) the generated contracts are sufficiently expressive for discriminating buggy from correct behavior, and (3) verifiers supplied with LLM inferred functional contracts produce fewer false alarms than when provided with postconditions alone. Further investigations show that LLM inferred preconditions generally align well with developers intentions which allows us to use automatic software verifiers to catch real-world bugs.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Explanation-Guided Learning for Transformer-Based Chest X-Ray Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization. While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally, it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.</description>

      <title>Beyond Seeing: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs on Tool-Enabled Image Perception, Transformation, and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored. Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS, an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model (GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Federated Learning for Crop Yield Prediction in Smart Agricultural Production Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we presents a novel hierarchical federated learning architecture specifically designed for smart agricultural production systems and crop yield prediction. Our approach introduces a seasonal subscription mechanism where farms join crop-specific clusters at the beginning of each agricultural season. The proposed three-layer architecture consists of individual smart farms at the client level, crop-specific aggregators at the middle layer, and a global model aggregator at the top level. Within each crop cluster, clients collaboratively train specialized models tailored to specific crop types, which are then aggregated to produce a higher-level global model that integrates knowledge across multiple crops. This hierarchical design enables both local specialization for individual crop types and global generalization across diverse agricultural contexts while preserving data privacy and reducing communication overhead. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, showing that local and crop-layer models closely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly outperforming standard machine learning models. The results validate the advantages of hierarchical federated learning in the agricultural context, particularly for scenarios involving heterogeneous farming environments and privacy-sensitive agricultural data.</description>

      <title>HYPE: Hybrid Planning with Ego Proposal-Conditioned Predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe and interpretable motion planning in complex urban environments needs to reason about bidirectional multi-agent interactions. This reasoning requires to estimate the costs of potential ego driving maneuvers. Many existing planners generate initial trajectories with sampling-based methods and refine them by optimizing on learned predictions of future environment states, which requires a cost function that encodes the desired vehicle behavior. Designing such a cost function can be very challenging, especially if a wide range of complex urban scenarios has to be considered. We propose HYPE: HYbrid Planning with Ego proposal-conditioned predictions, a planner that integrates multimodal trajectory proposals from a learned proposal model as heuristic priors into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) refinement. To model bidirectional interactions, we introduce an ego-conditioned occupancy prediction model, enabling consistent, scene-aware reasoning. Our design significantly simplifies cost function design in refinement by considering proposal-driven guidance, requiring only minimalistic grid-based cost terms. Evaluations on large-scale real-world benchmarks nuPlan and DeepUrban show that HYPE effectively achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in safety and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Hey, wait a minute: on at-issue sensitivity in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the naturalness of dialogue in language models (LMs) is not trivial: notions of 'naturalness' vary, and scalable quantitative metrics remain limited. This study leverages the linguistic notion of 'at-issueness' to assess dialogue naturalness and introduces a new method: Divide, Generate, Recombine, and Compare (DGRC). DGRC (i) divides a dialogue as a prompt, (ii) generates continuations for subparts using LMs, (iii) recombines the dialogue and continuations, and (iv) compares the likelihoods of the recombined sequences. This approach mitigates bias in linguistic analyses of LMs and enables systematic testing of discourse-sensitive behavior. Applying DGRC, we find that LMs prefer to continue dialogue on at-issue content, with this effect enhanced in instruct-tuned models. They also reduce their at-issue preference when relevant cues (e.g., "Hey, wait a minute") are present. Although instruct-tuning does not further amplify this modulation, the pattern reflects a hallmark of successful dialogue dynamics.</description>

      <title>VQArt-Bench: A semantically rich VQA Benchmark for Art and Cultural Heritage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis. Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Neurodegeneration with Brain Age Gap Prediction Models: A Graph Signal Processing Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurodegeneration, characterized by the progressive loss of neuronal structure or function, is commonly assessed in clinical practice through reductions in cortical thickness or brain volume, as visualized by structural MRI. While informative, these conventional approaches lack the statistical sophistication required to fully capture the spatially correlated and heterogeneous nature of neurodegeneration, which manifests both in healthy aging and in neurological disorders. To address these limitations, brain age gap has emerged as a promising data-driven biomarker of brain health. The brain age gap prediction (BAGP) models estimate the difference between a person's predicted brain age from neuroimaging data and their chronological age. The resulting brain age gap serves as a compact biomarker of brain health, with recent studies demonstrating its predictive utility for disease progression and severity. However, practical adoption of BAGP models is hindered by their methodological obscurities and limited generalizability across diverse clinical populations. This tutorial article provides an overview of BAGP and introduces a principled framework for this application based on recent advancements in graph signal processing (GSP). In particular, we focus on graph neural networks (GNNs) and introduce the coVariance neural network (VNN), which leverages the anatomical covariance matrices derived from structural MRI. VNNs offer strong theoretical grounding and operational interpretability, enabling robust estimation of brain age gap predictions. By integrating perspectives from GSP, machine learning, and network neuroscience, this work clarifies the path forward for reliable and interpretable BAGP models and outlines future research directions in personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Matters in Dynamic Gaussian Splatting for Monocular 4D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation, vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.</description>

      <title>Dr.LLM: Dynamic Layer Routing in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process every token through all layers of a transformer stack, causing wasted computation on simple queries and insufficient flexibility for harder ones that need deeper reasoning. Adaptive-depth methods can improve efficiency, but prior approaches rely on costly inference-time search, architectural changes, or large-scale retraining, and in practice often degrade accuracy despite efficiency gains. We introduce Dr.LLM, Dynamic routing of Layers for LLMs, a retrofittable framework that equips pretrained models with lightweight per-layer routers deciding to skip, execute, or repeat a block. Routers are trained with explicit supervision: using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we derive high-quality layer configurations that preserve or improve accuracy under a compute budget. Our design, windowed pooling for stable routing, focal loss with class balancing, and bottleneck MLP routers, ensures robustness under class imbalance and long sequences. On ARC (logic) and DART (math), Dr.LLM improves accuracy by up to +3.4%p while saving 5 layers per example on average. Routers generalize to out-of-domain tasks (MMLU, GSM8k, AIME, TruthfulQA, SQuADv2, GPQA, PIQA, AGIEval) with only 0.85% accuracy drop while retaining efficiency, and outperform prior routing methods by up to +7.7%p. Overall, Dr.LLM shows that explicitly supervised routers retrofit frozen LLMs for budget-aware, accuracy-driven inference without altering base weights.</description>

      <title>MVP4D: Multi-View Portrait Video Diffusion for Animatable 4D Avatars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film, virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming, requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here, we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model, MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to 360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of generated avatars compared to previous methods.</description>

      <title>UniFusion: Vision-Language Model as Unified Encoder in Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text. This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI), which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating the unified encoder design of UniFusion.</description>

      <title>CuMPerLay: Learning Cubical Multiparameter Persistence Vectorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes. Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured image analysis.</description>

      <title>DriveVLA-W0: World Models Amplify Data Scaling Law in Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However, VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose \textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment. We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a 680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size increases.</description>

      <title>Causal Agent based on Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large language model (LLM) has achieved significant success across various domains. However, the inherent complexity of causal problems and causal theory poses challenges in accurately describing them in natural language, making it difficult for LLM to comprehend and use them effectively. Causal methods are not easily conveyed through natural language, which hinders LLM's ability to apply them accurately. Additionally, causal datasets are typically tabular, while LLM excels in handling natural language data, creating a structural mismatch that impedes effective reasoning with tabular data. To address these challenges, we have equipped the LLM with causal tools within an agent framework, named the Causal Agent, enabling it to tackle causal problems. The causal agent comprises tools, memory, and reasoning modules. In the tool module, the causal agent calls Python code and uses the encapsulated causal function module to align tabular data with natural language. In the reasoning module, the causal agent performs reasoning through multiple iterations with the tools. In the memory module, the causal agent maintains a dictionary instance where the keys are unique names and the values are causal graphs. To verify the causal ability of the causal agent, we established a Causal Tabular Question Answer (CausalTQA) benchmark consisting of four levels of causal problems: variable level, edge level, causal graph level, and causal effect level. CausalTQA consists of about 1.4K for these four levels questions. Causal agent demonstrates remarkable efficacy on the four-level causal problems, with accuracy rates all above 80\%. Through verification on the real-world dataset QRData, the causal agent is 6\% higher than the original SOTA. For further insights and implementation details, our code is accessible via the GitHub repository https://github.com/kairong-han/causal_agent.</description>

      <title>Taming Text-to-Image Synthesis for Novices: User-centric Prompt Generation via Multi-turn Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of text-to-image synthesis (TIS) models has significantly influenced digital image creation by producing high-quality visuals from written descriptions. Yet these models are sensitive on textual prompts, posing a challenge for novice users who may not be familiar with TIS prompt writing. Existing solutions relieve this via automatic prompt expansion or generation from a user query. However, this single-turn manner suffers from limited user-centricity in terms of result interpretability and user interactivity. Thus, we propose DialPrompt, a dialogue-based TIS prompt generation model that emphasizes user experience for novice users. DialPrompt is designed to follow a multi-turn workflow, where in each round of dialogue the model guides user to express their preferences on possible optimization dimensions before generating the final TIS prompt. To achieve this, we mined 15 essential dimensions for high-quality prompts from advanced users and curated a multi-turn dataset. Through training on this dataset, DialPrompt improves user-centricity by allowing users to perceive and control the creation process of TIS prompts. Experiments indicate that DialPrompt improves significantly in user-centricity score compared with existing approaches while maintaining a competitive quality of synthesized images. In our user evaluation, DialPrompt is highly rated by 19 human reviewers (especially novices).</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Autonomous LLM Agents for Explainable Power Electronics Modulation Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM-based autonomous agents have recently shown strong capabilities in solving complex industrial design tasks. However, in domains aiming for carbon neutrality and high-performance renewable energy systems, current AI-assisted design automation methods face critical challenges in explainability, scalability, and practical usability. To address these limitations, we introduce PHIA (Physics-Informed Autonomous Agent), an LLM-driven system that automates modulation design for power converters in Power Electronics Systems with minimal human intervention. In contrast to traditional pipeline-based methods, PHIA incorporates an LLM-based planning module that interactively acquires and verifies design requirements via a user-friendly chat interface. This planner collaborates with physics-informed simulation and optimization components to autonomously generate and iteratively refine modulation designs. The interactive interface also supports interpretability by providing textual explanations and visual outputs throughout the design process. Experimental results show that PHIA reduces standard mean absolute error by 63.2% compared to the second-best benchmark and accelerates the overall design process by over 33 times. A user study involving 20 domain experts further confirms PHIA's superior design efficiency and usability, highlighting its potential to transform industrial design workflows in power electronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the identification of causal effects in the presence of different types of constraints (e.g., logical constraints) in addition to the causal graph. These constraints impose restrictions on the models (parameterizations) induced by the causal graph, reducing the set of models considered by the identifiability problem. We formalize the notion of constrained identifiability, which takes a set of constraints as another input to the classical definition of identifiability. We then introduce a framework for testing constrained identifiability by employing tractable Arithmetic Circuits (ACs), which enables us to accommodate constraints systematically. We show that this AC-based approach is at least as complete as existing algorithms (e.g., do-calculus) for testing classical identifiability, which only assumes the constraint of strict positivity. We use examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of this AC-based approach by showing that unidentifiable causal effects may become identifiable under different types of constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite excelling in high-level reasoning, current language models lack robustness in real-world scenarios and perform poorly on fundamental problem-solving tasks that are intuitive to humans. This paper argues that both challenges stem from a core discrepancy between human and machine cognitive development. While both systems rely on increasing representational power, the absence of core knowledge, foundational cognitive structures in humans, prevents language models from developing robust, generalizable abilities, where complex skills are grounded in simpler ones within their respective domains. It explores empirical evidence of core knowledge in humans, analyzes why language models fail to acquire it, and argues that this limitation is not an inherent architectural constraint. Finally, it outlines a workable proposal for systematically integrating core knowledge into future multi-modal language models through the large-scale generation of synthetic training data using a cognitive prototyping strategy.</description>

      <title>Creativity or Brute Force? Using Brainteasers as a Window into the Problem-Solving Abilities of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accuracy remains a standard metric for evaluating AI systems, but it offers limited insight into how models arrive at their solutions. In this work, we introduce a benchmark based on brainteasers written in long narrative form to probe more deeply into the types of reasoning strategies that models use. Brainteasers are well-suited for this goal because they can be solved with multiple approaches, such as a few-step solution that uses a creative insight or a longer solution that uses more brute force. We investigate large language models (LLMs) across multiple layers of reasoning, focusing not only on correctness but also on the quality and creativity of their solutions. We investigate many aspects of the reasoning process: (1) semantic parsing of the brainteasers into precise mathematical competition style formats; (2) generating solutions from these mathematical forms; (3) self-correcting solutions based on gold solutions; (4) producing step-by-step sketches of solutions; and (5) making use of hints. We find that LLMs are in many cases able to find creative, insightful solutions to brainteasers, suggesting that they capture some of the capacities needed to solve novel problems in creative ways. Nonetheless, there also remain situations where they rely on brute force despite the availability of more efficient, creative solutions, highlighting a potential direction for improvement in the reasoning abilities of LLMs.</description>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently seen transformative breakthroughs in the life sciences, expanding possibilities for researchers to interpret biological information at an unprecedented capacity, with novel applications and advances being made almost daily. In order to maximise return on the growing investments in AI-based life science research and accelerate this progress, it has become urgent to address the exacerbation of long-standing research challenges arising from the rapid adoption of AI methods. We review the increased erosion of trust in AI research outputs, driven by the issues of poor reusability and reproducibility, and highlight their consequent impact on environmental sustainability. Furthermore, we discuss the fragmented components of the AI ecosystem and lack of guiding pathways to best support Open and Sustainable AI (OSAI) model development. In response, this perspective introduces a practical set of OSAI recommendations directly mapped to over 300 components of the AI ecosystem. Our work connects researchers with relevant AI resources, facilitating the implementation of sustainable, reusable and transparent AI. Built upon life science community consensus and aligned to existing efforts, the outputs of this perspective are designed to aid the future development of policy and structured pathways for guiding AI implementation.</description>

      <title>EgoBrain: Synergizing Minds and Eyes For Human Action Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), in particular electroencephalography (EEG), with artificial intelligence (AI) has shown tremendous promise in decoding human cognition and behavior from neural signals. In particular, the rise of multimodal AI models have brought new possibilities that have never been imagined before. Here, we present EgoBrain --the world's first large-scale, temporally aligned multimodal dataset that synchronizes egocentric vision and EEG of human brain over extended periods of time, establishing a new paradigm for human-centered behavior analysis. This dataset comprises 61 hours of synchronized 32-channel EEG recordings and first-person video from 40 participants engaged in 29 categories of daily activities. We then developed a muiltimodal learning framework to fuse EEG and vision for action understanding, validated across both cross-subject and cross-environment challenges, achieving an action recognition accuracy of 66.70%. EgoBrain paves the way for a unified framework for brain-computer interface with multiple modalities. All data, tools, and acquisition protocols are openly shared to foster open science in cognitive computing.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Reconcile Knowledge Conflicts in Counterfactual Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models have been shown to contain extensive world knowledge in their parameters, enabling impressive performance on many knowledge intensive tasks. However, when deployed in novel settings, LLMs often encounter situations where they must integrate parametric knowledge with new or unfamiliar information. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can combine knowledge in-context with their parametric knowledge through the lens of counterfactual reasoning. Through synthetic and real experiments in multi-hop reasoning problems, we show that LLMs generally struggle with counterfactual reasoning, often resorting to exclusively using their parametric knowledge. Moreover, we show that simple post-hoc finetuning can struggle to instill counterfactual reasoning ability -- often leading to degradation in stored parametric knowledge. Ultimately, our work reveals important limitations of current LLM's abilities to re-purpose parametric knowledge in novel settings.</description>

      <title>CoRGI: Verified Chain-of-Thought Reasoning with Post-hoc Visual Grounding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal reasoning with vision-language models (VLMs) often suffers from hallucinations, as models tend to generate explanations after only a superficial inspection of the image. We present \textbf{CoRGI}(\textbf{C}hain \textbf{o}f \textbf{R}easoning with \textbf{G}rounded \textbf{I}nsights), a framework that enhances reasoning reliability through post-hoc verification of chain-of-thought outputs. Given a VLM-generated rationale, CoRGI decomposes it into step-wise statements, grounds each step in visual evidence, and filters or corrects unsupported claims before producing the final answer. Experiments on five challenging benchmark-VCR, ScienceQA, MMMU, MathVista, and HallusionBenc-demonstrate that CoRGI consistently improves both answer accuracy and explanation faithfulness across multiple VLM backbones, including Qwen-2.5VL, LLaVA-1.6, and Gemma3-12B. Beyond quantitative gains, qualitative analyses further illustrate how the verification process reduces hallucination and strengthens interpretability, suggesting that post-hoc visual grounding is a promising direction for building more trustworthy and transparent multimodal reasoning systems.</description>

      <title>Scaling Multi-Agent Epistemic Planning through GNN-Derived Heuristics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) is an autonomous planning framework for reasoning about both the physical world and the beliefs of agents, with applications in domains where information flow and awareness among agents are critical. The richness of MEP requires states to be represented as Kripke structures, i.e., directed labeled graphs. This representation limits the applicability of existing heuristics, hindering the scalability of epistemic solvers, which must explore an exponential search space without guidance, resulting often in intractability. To address this, we exploit Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn patterns and relational structures within epistemic states, to guide the planning process. GNNs, which naturally capture the graph-like nature of Kripke models, allow us to derive meaningful estimates of state quality -- e.g., the distance from the nearest goal -- by generalizing knowledge obtained from previously solved planning instances. We integrate these predictive heuristics into an epistemic planning pipeline and evaluate them against standard baselines, showing improvements in the scalability of multi-agent epistemic planning.</description>

      <title>Modular Embedding Recomposition for Incremental Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at https://github.com/aimagelab/mammoth.</description>

      <title>ChatThero: An LLM-Supported Chatbot for Behavior Change and Therapeutic Support in Addiction Recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect millions of people, and relapses are common, requiring multi-session treatments. Access to care is limited, which contributes to the challenge of recovery support. We present \textbf{ChatThero}, an innovative low-cost, multi-session, stressor-aware, and memory-persistent autonomous \emph{language agent} designed to facilitate long-term behavior change and therapeutic support in addiction recovery. Unlike existing work that mostly finetuned large language models (LLMs) on patient-therapist conversation data, ChatThero was trained in a multi-agent simulated environment that mirrors real therapy. We created anonymized patient profiles from recovery communities (e.g., Reddit). We classify patients as \texttt{easy}, \texttt{medium}, and \texttt{difficult}, three scales representing their resistance to recovery. We created an external environment by introducing stressors (e.g., social determinants of health) to simulate real-world situations. We dynamically inject clinically-grounded therapeutic strategies (motivational interview and cognitive behavioral therapy). Our evaluation, conducted by both human (blinded clinicians) and LLM-as-Judge, shows that ChatThero is superior in empathy and clinical relevance. We show that stressor simulation improves robustness of ChatThero. Explicit stressors increase relapse-like setbacks, matching real-world patterns. We evaluate ChatThero with behavioral change metrics. On a 1--5 scale, ChatThero raises \texttt{motivation} by $+1.71$ points (from $2.39$ to $4.10$) and \texttt{confidence} by $+1.67$ points (from $1.52$ to $3.19$), substantially outperforming GPT-5. On \texttt{difficult} patients, ChatThero reaches the success milestone with $26\%$ fewer turns than GPT-5.</description>

      <title>MapAgent: A Hierarchical Agent for Geospatial Reasoning with Dynamic Map Tool Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agentic AI has significantly extended the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling complex reasoning and tool use. However, most existing frameworks are tailored to domains such as mathematics, coding, or web automation, and fall short on geospatial tasks that require spatial reasoning, multi-hop planning, and real-time map interaction. To address these challenges, we introduce MapAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent plug-and-play framework with customized toolsets and agentic scaffolds for map-integrated geospatial reasoning. Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools uniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different geospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution. A high-level planner decomposes complex queries into subgoals, which are routed to specialized modules. For tool-heavy modules-such as map-based services-we then design a dedicated map-tool agent that efficiently orchestrates related APIs adaptively in parallel to effectively fetch geospatial data relevant for the query, while simpler modules (e.g., solution generation or answer extraction) operate without additional agent overhead. This hierarchical design reduces cognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise coordination across similar APIs. We evaluate MapAgent on four diverse geospatial benchmarks-MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, and MapQA-and demonstrate substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented and agentic baselines. We open-source our framwork at https://github.com/Hasebul/MapAgent.</description>

      <title>Strategic Tradeoffs Between Humans and AI in Multi-Agent Bargaining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in collaborative human activities such as business negotiations and group coordination, it becomes critical to evaluate both the performance gains they can achieve and how they interact in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Unlike traditional statistical agents such as Bayesian models, which may excel under well-specified conditions, large language models (LLMs) can generalize across diverse, real-world scenarios, raising new questions about how their strategies and behaviors compare to those of humans and other agent types. In this work, we compare outcomes and behavioral dynamics across humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in a dynamic negotiation setting under identical conditions. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks. By establishing foundational behavioral baselines under matched conditions, this work provides a baseline for future studies in more applied, variable-rich environments.</description>

      <title>MoEs Are Stronger than You Think: Hyper-Parallel Inference Scaling with RoE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generation quality of large language models (LLMs) is often improved by utilizing inference-time sequence-level scaling methods (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). We introduce hyper-parallel scaling, a complementary framework that improves prediction quality at the token level. Hyper-parallel scaling computes and aggregates multiple output proposals for a single token from the model. We implement this concept in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, which we refer to as Roster of Experts (RoE). RoE is a training-free inference algorithm that turns a single MoE into a dynamic ensemble of MoEs. RoE injects controlled stochasticity into the expert routing mechanism, enabling it to sample multiple diverse experts for each token and aggregate their outputs for a more accurate final prediction. To overcome the computational cost, we introduce an efficient batching strategy and a specialized KV-caching mechanism that minimizes compute and memory overhead. For example, RoE enables a 7B MoE model to match the performance of a 10.5B MoE model while using 30% less compute for inference. These gains are achieved without any fine-tuning of model parameters.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models in Operations Research: Methods, Applications, and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Operations research (OR) is a core methodology that supports complex system decision-making, with broad applications in transportation, supply chain management, and production scheduling. However, traditional approaches that rely on expert-driven modeling and manual parameter tuning often struggle with large-scale, dynamic, and multi-constraint problems, limiting scalability and real-time applicability. Large language models (LLMs), with capabilities in semantic understanding, structured generation, and reasoning control, offer new opportunities to overcome these challenges. They can translate natural language problem descriptions into mathematical models or executable code, generate heuristics, evolve algorithms, and directly solve optimization tasks. This shifts the paradigm from human-driven processes to intelligent human-AI collaboration. This paper systematically reviews progress in applying LLMs to OR, categorizing existing methods into three pathways: automatic modeling, auxiliary optimization, and direct solving. It also examines evaluation benchmarks and domain-specific applications, and highlights key challenges, including unstable semantic-to-structure mapping, fragmented research, limited generalization and interpretability, insufficient evaluation systems, and barriers to industrial deployment. Finally, it outlines potential research directions. Overall, LLMs demonstrate strong potential to reshape the OR paradigm by enhancing interpretability, adaptability, and scalability, paving the way for next-generation intelligent optimization systems.</description>

      <title>Similarity Field Theory: A Mathematical Framework for Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We posit that persisting and transforming similarity relations form the structural basis of any comprehensible dynamic system. This paper introduces Similarity Field Theory, a mathematical framework that formalizes the principles governing similarity values among entities and their evolution. We define: (1) a similarity field $S: U \times U \to [0,1]$ over a universe of entities $U$, satisfying reflexivity $S(E,E)=1$ and treated as a directed relational field (asymmetry and non-transitivity are allowed); (2) the evolution of a system through a sequence $Z_p=(X_p,S^{(p)})$ indexed by $p=0,1,2,\ldots$; (3) concepts $K$ as entities that induce fibers $F_{\alpha}(K)={E\in U \mid S(E,K)\ge \alpha}$, i.e., superlevel sets of the unary map $S_K(E):=S(E,K)$; and (4) a generative operator $G$ that produces new entities. Within this framework, we formalize a generative definition of intelligence: an operator $G$ is intelligent with respect to a concept $K$ if, given a system containing entities belonging to the fiber of $K$, it generates new entities that also belong to that fiber. Similarity Field Theory thus offers a foundational language for characterizing, comparing, and constructing intelligent systems. At a high level, this framework reframes intelligence and interpretability as geometric problems on similarity fields -- preserving and composing level-set fibers -- rather than purely statistical ones. We prove two theorems: (i) asymmetry blocks mutual inclusion; and (ii) stability requires either an anchor coordinate or eventual confinement within a level set. These results ensure that the evolution of similarity fields is both constrained and interpretable, culminating in a framework that not only interprets large language models but also introduces a novel way of using them as experimental probes of societal cognition, supported by preliminary evidence across diverse consumer categories.</description>

      <title>Clean First, Align Later: Benchmarking Preference Data Cleaning for Reliable LLM Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent, which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We release modular implementations of all methods to catalyze further research: https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/PrefCleanBench.</description>

      <title>L2M-AID: Autonomous Cyber-Physical Defense by Fusing Semantic Reasoning of Large Language Models with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Preprint)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&amp;CK for ICS framework. Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS, deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability, presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Agent Learning via Early Experience</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks. However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards (e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.</description>

      <title>TripScore: Benchmarking and rewarding real-world travel planning with fine-grained evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Travel planning is a valuable yet complex task that poses significant challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75%) and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward scores.</description>

      <title>Humanoid Artificial Consciousness Designed with Large Language Model Based on Psychoanalysis and Personality Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human consciousness is still a concept hard to define with current scientific understanding. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant advancements across various domains including translation and summarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current upfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore, proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating psychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing consciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial consciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based on the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters with different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several attributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's artificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct situations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and logical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and the final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier classification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated consciousness, although the difference in response between different characters and consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed models incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead to building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid consciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for improving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts.</description>

      <title>Concise Reasoning in the Lens of Lagrangian Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concise reasoning in large language models seeks to generate only essential intermediate steps needed to arrive at a final answer, thereby alleviating issues of overthinking. Most proposed approaches hinge on carefully hand-crafted heuristics, struggling to balance concision with performance, often failing to adapt across domains and model scales. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing a principled and pragmatic strategy, performance-aware length updating (PALU). As a principled algorithm, PALU formulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem, minimizing response length subject to a performance constraint, and then applies Lagrangian optimization to convert it into a tractable unconstrained problem. As a pragmatic solution, PALU streamlines complicated update rules through three approximations: (i) estimating performance with off-policy rollouts, (ii) truncating the Lagrange multiplier to two extremes, and (iii) replacing gradient-based updates with quantile-driven length adjustments. PALU reduces output length by 65% while improving accuracy by 15% when applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, averaged over five benchmarks, outperforming a range of alternative methods. Furthermore, PALU is demonstrated to adapt across both domain (logic, STEM and math) and model scale (1.5B, 7B, 14B) entrenching the algorithm as a practical and effective concise reasoning approach.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Dual Reasoner: Large Reasoning Models Can Think Efficiently by Hybrid Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved superior performance on various reasoning scenarios, they often suffer from increased computational costs and inference latency caused by overthinking. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Dual Reasoner, which supports two reasoning modes: fast thinking and slow thinking. ADR dynamically alternates between these modes based on the contextual complexity during reasoning. ADR is trained in two stages: (1) A cold-start stage using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model with the ability to integrate both fast and slow reasoning modes, in which we construct a hybrid reasoning dataset through a dedicated pipeline to provide large-scale supervision. (2) A reinforcement learning stage for optimizing reasoning effort, where we introduce Entropy-guided Hybrid Policy Optimization EHPO, an RL training framework employing an entropy-guided dynamic rollout strategy for branching at high-entropy units and a difficulty-aware penalty to balance fast and slow reasoning. Across challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ADR achieves an effective balance between reasoning performance and efficiency among state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, ADR yields a performance gain of up to 6.1%, while reducing the reasoning output length by 49.5% to 59.3%.</description>

      <title>DRIFT: Decompose, Retrieve, Illustrate, then Formalize Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation: informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet, ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and 42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.</description>

      <title>Optimized Layerwise Approximation for Efficient Private Inference on Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10349v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have explored the deployment of privacy-preserving deep neural networks utilizing homomorphic encryption (HE), especially for private inference (PI). Many works have attempted the approximation-aware training (AAT) approach in PI, changing the activation functions of a model to low-degree polynomials that are easier to compute on HE by allowing model retraining. However, due to constraints in the training environment, it is often necessary to consider post-training approximation (PTA), using the pre-trained parameters of the existing plaintext model without retraining. Existing PTA studies have uniformly approximated the activation function in all layers to a high degree to mitigate accuracy loss from approximation, leading to significant time consumption. This study proposes an optimized layerwise approximation (OLA), a systematic framework that optimizes both accuracy loss and time consumption by using different approximation polynomials for each layer in the PTA scenario. For efficient approximation, we reflect the layerwise impact on the classification accuracy by considering the actual input distribution of each activation function while constructing the optimization problem. Additionally, we provide a dynamic programming technique to solve the optimization problem and achieve the optimized layerwise degrees in polynomial time. As a result, the OLA method reduces inference times for the ResNet-20 model and the ResNet-32 model by 3.02 times and 2.82 times, respectively, compared to prior state-of-the-art implementations employing uniform degree polynomials. Furthermore, we successfully classified CIFAR-10 by replacing the GELU function in the ConvNeXt model with only 3-degree polynomials using the proposed method, without modifying the backbone model.</description>

      <title>Can ChatGPT support software verification?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have become increasingly effective in software engineering tasks such as code generation, debugging and repair. Language models like ChatGPT can not only generate code, but also explain its inner workings and in particular its correctness. This raises the question whether we can utilize ChatGPT to support formal software verification.
  In this paper, we take some first steps towards answering this question. More specifically, we investigate whether ChatGPT can generate loop invariants. Loop invariant generation is a core task in software verification, and the generation of valid and useful invariants would likely help formal verifiers. To provide some first evidence on this hypothesis, we ask ChatGPT to annotate 106 C programs with loop invariants. We check validity and usefulness of the generated invariants by passing them to two verifiers, Frama-C and CPAchecker. Our evaluation shows that ChatGPT is able to produce valid and useful invariants allowing Frama-C to verify tasks that it could not solve before. Based on our initial insights, we propose ways of combining ChatGPT (or large language models in general) and software verifiers, and discuss current limitations and open issues.</description>

      <title>When "Competency" in Reasoning Opens the Door to Vulnerability: Jailbreaking LLMs via Novel Complex Ciphers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10601v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) safety have primarily focused on mitigating attacks crafted in natural language or common ciphers (e.g. Base64), which are likely integrated into newer models' safety training. However, we reveal a paradoxical vulnerability: as LLMs advance in reasoning, they inadvertently become more susceptible to novel jailbreaking attacks. Enhanced reasoning enables LLMs to interpret complex instructions and decode complex user-defined ciphers, creating an exploitable security gap. To study this vulnerability, we introduce Attacks using Custom Encryptions (ACE), a jailbreaking technique that encodes malicious queries with novel ciphers. Extending ACE, we introduce Layered Attacks using Custom Encryptions (LACE), which applies multi-layer ciphers to amplify attack complexity. Furthermore, we develop CipherBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' accuracy in decoding encrypted benign text. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off: LLMs that are more capable of decoding ciphers are more vulnerable to LACE, with success rates on gpt-oss-20b escalating from 60% under ACE to 72% with LACE. These findings highlight a critical insight: as LLMs become more adept at deciphering complex user ciphers--many of which cannot be preemptively included in safety training--they become increasingly exploitable.</description>

      <title>Offline Fictitious Self-Play for Competitive Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables policy improvement from fixed datasets without online interactions, making it highly suitable for real-world applications lacking efficient simulators. Despite its success in the single-agent setting, offline multi-agent RL remains a challenge, especially in competitive games. Firstly, unaware of the game structure, it is impossible to interact with the opponents and conduct a major learning paradigm, self-play, for competitive games. Secondly, real-world datasets cannot cover all the state and action space in the game, resulting in barriers to identifying Nash equilibrium (NE). To address these issues, this paper introduces OFF-FSP, the first practical model-free offline RL algorithm for competitive games. We start by simulating interactions with various opponents by adjusting the weights of the fixed dataset with importance sampling. This technique allows us to learn the best responses to different opponents and employ the Offline Self-Play learning framework. To overcome the challenge of partial coverage, we combine the single-agent offline RL method with Fictitious Self-Play (FSP) to approximate NE by constraining the approximate best responses away from out-of-distribution actions. Experiments on matrix games, extensive-form poker, and board games demonstrate that OFF-FSP achieves significantly lower exploitability than state-of-the-art baselines. Finally, we validate OFF-FSP on a real-world human-robot competitive task, demonstrating its potential for solving complex, hard-to-simulate real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Frontier of Vision-Language Models: A Survey of Current Methodologies and Future Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07214v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly reshaped the trajectory of the AI revolution. Nevertheless, these LLMs exhibit a notable limitation, as they are primarily adept at processing textual information. To address this constraint, researchers have endeavored to integrate visual capabilities with LLMs, resulting in the emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). These advanced models are instrumental in tackling more intricate tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. In our comprehensive survey paper, we delve into the key advancements within the realm of VLMs. Our classification organizes VLMs into three distinct categories: models dedicated to vision-language understanding, models that process multimodal inputs to generate unimodal (textual) outputs and models that both accept and produce multimodal inputs and outputs.This classification is based on their respective capabilities and functionalities in processing and generating various modalities of data.We meticulously dissect each model, offering an extensive analysis of its foundational architecture, training data sources, as well as its strengths and limitations wherever possible, providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of its essential components. We also analyzed the performance of VLMs in various benchmark datasets. By doing so, we aim to offer a nuanced understanding of the diverse landscape of VLMs. Additionally, we underscore potential avenues for future research in this dynamic domain, anticipating further breakthroughs and advancements.</description>

      <title>ACCO: Accumulate While You Communicate for Communication-Overlapped Sharded LLM Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training LLMs relies on distributed implementations using multiple GPUs to compute gradients in parallel with sharded optimizers. However, synchronizing gradients in data parallel setups introduces communication overhead that grows with the number of workers, limiting parallelization efficiency. Local optimization algorithms reduce communications but incur high memory costs as they prevent optimizer state sharding, hindering scalability. To address this, we propose \textbf{AC}cumulate while \textbf{CO}mmunicate (ACCO), a memory-efficient optimization algorithm for distributed LLM training. By synchronizing delayed gradients while computing new ones, ACCO reduces GPU idle time and supports heterogeneous hardware. To mitigate the convergence issues caused by delayed updates, we introduce a novel technique ensuring training dynamics align with standard distributed optimization. Compared to ZeRO-1, our approach is significantly faster and scales effectively across heterogeneous hardware.</description>

      <title>Assessing Latency in ASR Systems: A Methodological Perspective for Real-Time Use</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems generate real-time transcriptions but often miss nuances that human interpreters capture. While ASR is useful in many contexts, interpreters-who already use ASR tools such as Dragon-add critical value, especially in sensitive settings such as diplomatic meetings where subtle language is key. Human interpreters not only perceive these nuances but can adjust in real time, improving accuracy, while ASR handles basic transcription tasks. However, ASR systems introduce a delay that does not align with real-time interpretation needs. The user-perceived latency of ASR systems differs from that of interpretation because it measures the time between speech and transcription delivery. To address this, we propose a new approach to measuring delay in ASR systems and validate if they are usable in live interpretation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Requirements Engineering: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06741v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Introduction: Requirements engineering faces challenges due to the handling of increasingly complex software systems. These challenges can be addressed using generative AI. Given that GenAI based RE has not been systematically analyzed in detail, this review examines related research, focusing on trends, methodologies, challenges, and future directions. Methods: A systematic methodology for paper selection, data extraction, and feature analysis is used to comprehensively review 238 articles published from 2019 to 2025 and available from major academic databases. Results: Generative pretrained transformer models dominate current applications (67.3%), but research remains unevenly distributed across RE phases, with analysis (30.0%) and elicitation (22.1%) receiving the most attention, and management (6.8%) underexplored. Three core challenges: reproducibility (66.8%), hallucinations (63.4%), and interpretability (57.1%) form a tightly interlinked triad affecting trust and consistency. Strong correlations (35% cooccurrence) indicate these challenges must be addressed holistically. Industrial adoption remains nascent, with over 90% of studies corresponding to early stage development and only 1.3% reaching production level integration. Conclusions: Evaluation practices show maturity gaps, limited tool and dataset availability, and fragmented benchmarking approaches. Despite the transformative potential of GenAI based RE, several barriers hinder practical adoption. The strong correlations among core challenges demand specialized architectures targeting interdependencies rather than isolated solutions. The limited deployment reflects systemic bottlenecks in generalizability, data quality, and scalable evaluation methods. Successful adoption requires coordinated development across technical robustness, methodological maturity, and governance integration.</description>

      <title>COMAL: A Convergent Meta-Algorithm for Aligning LLMs with General Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many alignment methods, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), rely on the Bradley-Terry reward assumption, which is not always sufficient to capture the full range and complexity of general human preferences. We explore RLHF under a general preference framework by modeling the alignment problem as a two-player zero-sum game in a game-theoretic framework, where the Nash equilibrium policy guarantees a 50% win rate against any competing policy. However, previous self-play algorithms for finding the Nash policy either diverge or only converge to a Nash policy in a modified game, even in a simple synthetic setting, thereby failing to maintain the 50% win rate guarantee against all other policies. We propose a meta-algorithm, Convergent Meta Alignment Algorithm (COMAL), for language model alignment with general preferences, inspired by convergent algorithms in game theory. We provide theoretical analysis that our meta-algorithm converges to an exact Nash policy in the last iterate and demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of synthetic and preference optimization datasets. COMAL is simple and can be integrated with many existing methods designed for preference optimization with minimal changes, and empirically it consistently maintains above 60.2% and 56.8% win rates, when applied to Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B, against all compared algorithms under controlled evaluations.</description>

      <title>Multi-View Majority Vote Learning Algorithms: Direct Minimization of PAC-Bayesian Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The PAC-Bayesian framework has significantly advanced the understanding of statistical learning, particularly for majority voting methods. Despite its successes, its application to multi-view learning -- a setting with multiple complementary data representations -- remains underexplored. In this work, we extend PAC-Bayesian theory to multi-view learning, introducing novel generalization bounds based on R\'enyi divergence. These bounds provide an alternative to traditional Kullback-Leibler divergence-based counterparts, leveraging the flexibility of R\'enyi divergence. Furthermore, we propose first- and second-order oracle PAC-Bayesian bounds and extend the C-bound to multi-view settings. To bridge theory and practice, we design efficient self-bounding optimization algorithms that align with our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Reframing Image Difference Captioning with BLIP2IDC and Synthetic Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of the generative models quality during the past years enabled the generation of edited variations of images at an important scale. To counter the harmful effects of such technology, the Image Difference Captioning (IDC) task aims to describe the differences between two images. While this task is successfully handled for simple 3D rendered images, it struggles on real-world images. The reason is twofold: the training data-scarcity, and the difficulty to capture fine-grained differences between complex images. To address those issues, we propose in this paper a simple yet effective framework to both adapt existing image captioning models to the IDC task and augment IDC datasets. We introduce BLIP2IDC, an adaptation of BLIP2 to the IDC task at low computational cost, and show it outperforms two-streams approaches by a significant margin on real-world IDC datasets. We also propose to use synthetic augmentation to improve the performance of IDC models in an agnostic fashion. We show that our synthetic augmentation strategy provides high quality data, leading to a challenging new dataset well-suited for IDC named Syned1.</description>

      <title>CiteBART: Learning to Generate Citations for Local Citation Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17534v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local citation recommendation (LCR) suggests a set of papers for a citation placeholder within a given context. The task has evolved as generative approaches have become more promising than the traditional pre-fetch and re-rank-based state-of-the-art approaches. This paper introduces citation-specific pre-training within an encoder-decoder architecture, where author-date citation tokens are masked to learn to reconstruct them to fulfill LCR. There are two variants for this pre-training. In the local context-only base scheme (CiteBART-Base), the citation token in a local context is masked to learn to predict the citation. The global version (CiteBART-Global) extends the local context with the citing paper's title and abstract to enrich the learning signal. CiteBART-Global achieves state-of-the-art performance on LCR benchmarks except for the FullTextPeerRead dataset, which is quite small to see the advantage of generative pre-training. The effect is significant in the larger benchmarks, e.g., Refseer and ArXiv., with the Refseer benchmark-trained model emerging as the best-performing model. We perform comprehensive experiments, including an ablation study, a qualitative analysis, and a taxonomy of hallucinations with detailed statistics. Our analyses confirm that CiteBART-Global has a cross-dataset generalization capability; the macro hallucination rate (MaHR) at the top-3 predictions is 4\%, and when the ground-truth is in the top-k prediction list, the hallucination tendency in the other predictions drops significantly.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Fair Orientations of Chores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of finding fair orientations of graphs of chores, in which each vertex corresponds to an agent, each edge corresponds to a chore, and a chore has zero marginal utility to an agent if its corresponding edge is not incident to the vertex corresponding to the agent. Recently, Zhou et al. (IJCAI, 2024) analyzed the complexity of deciding whether graphs containing a mixture of goods and chores have EFX orientations, and conjectured that deciding whether graphs containing only chores have EFX orientations is NP-complete. We resolve this conjecture by giving polynomial-time algorithms that find EF1 and EFX orientations of graphs containing only chores if they exist, even if there are self-loops. Remarkably, our result demonstrates a surprising separation between the case of goods and the case of chores, because deciding whether graphs containing only goods have EFX orientations was shown to be NP-complete by Christodoulou et al. (EC, 2023). In addition, we show the EF1 and EFX orientation problems for multigraphs to be NP-complete.</description>

      <title>GraphRAG under Fire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14050v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GraphRAG advances retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by structuring external knowledge as multi-scale knowledge graphs, enabling language models to integrate both broad context and granular details in their generation. While GraphRAG has demonstrated success across domains, its security implications remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, this work examines GraphRAG's vulnerability to poisoning attacks, uncovering an intriguing security paradox: existing RAG poisoning attacks are less effective under GraphRAG than conventional RAG, due to GraphRAG's graph-based indexing and retrieval; yet, the same features also create new attack surfaces. We present GragPoison, a novel attack that exploits shared relations in the underlying knowledge graph to craft poisoning text capable of compromising multiple queries simultaneously. GragPoison employs three key strategies: (i) relation injection to introduce false knowledge, (ii) relation enhancement to amplify poisoning influence, and (iii) narrative generation to embed malicious content within coherent text. Empirical evaluation across diverse datasets and models shows that GragPoison substantially outperforms existing attacks in terms of effectiveness (up to 98% success rate) and scalability (using less than 68% poisoning text) on multiple variations of GraphRAG. We also explore potential defensive measures and their limitations, identifying promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>AgentBreeder: Mitigating the AI Safety Risks of Multi-Agent Scaffolds via Self-Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00757v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaffolding Large Language Models (LLMs) into multi-agent systems often improves performance on complex tasks, but the safety impact of such scaffolds has not been thoroughly explored. We introduce AgentBreeder, a framework for multi-objective self-improving evolutionary search over scaffolds. We evaluate discovered scaffolds on widely recognized reasoning, mathematics, and safety benchmarks and compare them with popular baselines. In "blue" mode, we see a 79.4% average uplift in safety benchmark performance while maintaining or improving capability scores. In "red" mode, we find adversarially weak scaffolds emerging concurrently with capability optimization. Our work demonstrates the risks of multi-agent scaffolding and provides a framework for mitigating them. Code is available at https://github.com/jrosseruk/AgentBreeder.</description>

      <title>Query Brand Entity Linking in E-Commerce Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the brand entity linking problem for e-commerce search queries. The entity linking task is done by either i)a two-stage process consisting of entity mention detection followed by entity disambiguation or ii) an end-to-end linking approaches that directly fetch the target entity given the input text. The task presents unique challenges: queries are extremely short (averaging 2.4 words), lack natural language structure, and must handle a massive space of unique brands. We present a two-stage approach combining named-entity recognition with matching, and a novel end-to-end solution using extreme multi-class classification. We validate our solutions by both offline benchmarks and the impact of online A/B test.</description>

      <title>ParetoQ: Improving Scaling Laws in Extremely Low-bit LLM Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal bit-width for achieving the best trade-off between quantized model size and accuracy has been a subject of ongoing debate. While some advocate for 4-bit quantization, others propose that 1.58-bit offers superior results. However, the lack of a cohesive framework for different bits has left such conclusions relatively tenuous. We present ParetoQ, the first unified framework that facilitates rigorous comparisons across 1-bit, 1.58-bit, 2-bit, 3-bit, and 4-bit quantization settings. Our findings reveal a notable learning transition between 2 and 3 bits: For 3-bits and above, the fine-tuned models stay close to their original pre-trained distributions, whereas for learning 2-bit networks or below, the representations change drastically. By optimizing training schemes and refining quantization functions, ParetoQ surpasses all previous methods tailored to specific bit widths. Remarkably, our ParetoQ ternary 600M-parameter model even outperforms the previous SoTA ternary 3B-parameter model in accuracy, using only one-fifth of the parameters. Extensive experimentation shows that ternary, 2-bit, and 3-bit quantization maintains comparable performance in the size-accuracy trade-off and generally exceeds 4-bit and binary quantization. Considering hardware constraints, 2-bit quantization offers promising potential for memory reduction and speedup.</description>

      <title>FOCUS on Contamination: A Geospatial Deep Learning Framework with a Noise-Aware Loss for Surface Water PFAS Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14894v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), chemicals found in products like non-stick cookware, are unfortunately persistent environmental pollutants with severe health risks. Accurately mapping PFAS contamination is crucial for guiding targeted remediation efforts and protecting public and environmental health, yet detection across large regions remains challenging due to the cost of testing and the difficulty of simulating their spread. In this work, we introduce FOCUS, a geospatial deep learning framework with a label noise-aware loss function, to predict PFAS contamination in surface water over large regions. By integrating hydrological flow data, land cover information, and proximity to known PFAS sources, our approach leverages both spatial and environmental context to improve prediction accuracy. We evaluate the performance of our approach through extensive ablation studies, robustness analysis, real-world validation, and comparative analyses against baselines like sparse segmentation, as well as existing scientific methods, including Kriging and pollutant transport simulations. Results and expert feedback highlight our framework's potential for scalable PFAS monitoring.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Autonomous Driving Systems with Large Language Models: A Survey of Recent Advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) are revolutionizing transportation by reducing human intervention, improving operational efficiency, and enhancing safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been integrated into ADSs to support high-level decision-making through their powerful reasoning, instruction-following, and communication abilities. However, LLM-based single-agent ADSs face three major challenges: limited perception, insufficient collaboration, and high computational demands. To address these issues, recent advances in LLM-based multi-agent ADSs leverage language-driven communication and coordination to enhance inter-agent collaboration. This paper provides a frontier survey of this emerging intersection between NLP and multi-agent ADSs. We begin with a background introduction to related concepts, followed by a categorization of existing LLM-based methods based on different agent interaction modes. We then discuss agent-human interactions in scenarios where LLM-based agents engage with humans. Finally, we summarize key applications, datasets, and challenges to support future research.</description>

      <title>A Customized SAT-based Solver for Graph Coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce ZykovColor, a novel SAT-based algorithm to solve the graph coloring problem working on top of an encoding that mimics the Zykov tree. Our method is based on an approach of H\'ebrard and Katsirelos (2020) that employs a propagator to enforce transitivity constraints, incorporate lower bounds for search tree pruning, and enable inferred propagations.
  We leverage the recently introduced IPASIR-UP interface for CaDiCaL to implement these techniques with a SAT solver. Furthermore, we propose new features that take advantage of the underlying SAT solver. These include modifying the integrated decision strategy with vertex domination hints and using incremental bottom-up search that allows to reuse learned clauses from previous calls. Additionally, we integrate a more effective clique computation and an algorithm for computing the fractional chromatic number to improve the lower bounds used for pruning during the search.
  We validate the effectiveness of each new feature through an experimental analysis. ZykovColor outperforms other state-of-the-art graph coloring implementations on the DIMACS benchmark set. Further experiments on random Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs show that our new approach matches or outperforms state-of-the-art SAT-based methods for both very sparse and highly dense graphs. We give an additional configuration of ZykovColor that dominates other SAT-based methods on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs.</description>

      <title>MobileCity: An Efficient Framework for Large-Scale Urban Behavior Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16946v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative agents offer promising capabilities for simulating realistic urban behaviors. However, existing methods oversimplify transportation choices, rely heavily on static agent profiles leading to behavioral homogenization, and inherit prohibitive computational costs. To address these limitations, we present MobileCity, a lightweight simulation platform designed to model realistic urban mobility with high computational efficiency. We introduce a comprehensive transportation system with multiple transport modes, and collect questionnaire data from respondents to construct agent profiles. To enable scalable simulation, agents perform action selection within a pre-generated action space and uses local models for efficient agent memory generation. Through extensive micro and macro-level evaluations on 4,000 agents, we demonstrate that MobileCity generates more realistic urban behaviors than baselines while maintaining computational efficiency. We further explore practical applications such as predicting movement patterns and analyzing demographic trends in transportation preferences.

      <title>Time Travel is Cheating: Going Live with DeepFund for Real-Time Fund Investment Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable capabilities across financial tasks, including financial report summarization, earnings call transcript analysis, and asset classification. However, their real-world effectiveness in managing complex fund investment remains inadequately assessed. A fundamental limitation of existing benchmarks for evaluating LLM-driven trading strategies is their reliance on historical back-testing, inadvertently enabling LLMs to "time travel"-leveraging future information embedded in their training corpora, thus resulting in possible information leakage and overly optimistic performance estimates. To address this issue, we introduce DeepFund, a live fund benchmark tool designed to rigorously evaluate LLM in real-time market conditions. Utilizing a multi-agent architecture, DeepFund connects directly with real-time stock market data-specifically data published after each model pretraining cutoff-to ensure fair and leakage-free evaluations. Empirical tests on nine flagship LLMs from leading global institutions across multiple investment dimensions-including ticker-level analysis, investment decision-making, portfolio management, and risk control-reveal significant practical challenges. Notably, even cutting-edge models such as DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet incur net trading losses within DeepFund real-time evaluation environment, underscoring the present limitations of LLMs for active fund management.

      <title>Fixed Point Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a formal notion of fixed point explanations, inspired by the "why regress" principle, to assess, through recursive applications, the stability of the interplay between a model and its explainer. Fixed point explanations satisfy properties like minimality, stability, and faithfulness, revealing hidden model behaviours and explanatory weaknesses. We define convergence conditions for several classes of explainers, from feature-based to mechanistic tools like Sparse AutoEncoders, and we report quantitative and qualitative results for several datasets and models, including LLMs such as Llama-3.3-70B.</description>

      <title>Joint Embedding vs Reconstruction: Provable Benefits of Latent Space Prediction for Self Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstruction and joint embedding have emerged as two leading paradigms in Self Supervised Learning (SSL). Reconstruction methods focus on recovering the original sample from a different view in input space. On the other hand, joint embedding methods align the representations of different views in latent space. Both approaches offer compelling advantages, yet practitioners lack clear guidelines for choosing between them. In this work, we unveil the core mechanisms that distinguish each paradigm. By leveraging closed form solutions for both approaches, we precisely characterize how the view generation process, e.g. data augmentation, impacts the learned representations. We then demonstrate that, unlike supervised learning, both SSL paradigms require a minimal alignment between augmentations and irrelevant features to achieve asymptotic optimality with increasing sample size. Our findings indicate that in scenarios where these irrelevant features have a large magnitude, joint embedding methods are preferable because they impose a strictly weaker alignment condition compared to reconstruction based methods. These results not only clarify the trade offs between the two paradigms but also substantiate the empirical success of joint embedding approaches on real world challenging datasets.</description>

      <title>AsynFusion: Towards Asynchronous Latent Consistency Models for Decoupled Whole-Body Audio-Driven Avatars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whole-body audio-driven avatar pose and expression generation is a critical task for creating lifelike digital humans and enhancing the capabilities of interactive virtual agents, with wide-ranging applications in virtual reality, digital entertainment, and remote communication. Existing approaches often generate audio-driven facial expressions and gestures independently, which introduces a significant limitation: the lack of seamless coordination between facial and gestural elements, resulting in less natural and cohesive animations. To address this limitation, we propose AsynFusion, a novel framework that leverages diffusion transformers to achieve harmonious expression and gesture synthesis. The proposed method is built upon a dual-branch DiT architecture, which enables the parallel generation of facial expressions and gestures. Within the model, we introduce a Cooperative Synchronization Module to facilitate bidirectional feature interaction between the two modalities, and an Asynchronous LCM Sampling strategy to reduce computational overhead while maintaining high-quality outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsynFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating real-time, synchronized whole-body animations, consistently outperforming existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</description>

      <title>Steering Large Language Models for Machine Translation Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have simplified the production of personalized translations reflecting predefined stylistic constraints. However, these systems still struggle when stylistic requirements are implicitly represented by a set of examples, such as texts produced by a specific human translator. In this work, we explore various strategies for personalizing automatically generated translations when few examples are available, with a focus on the challenging domain of literary translation. We begin by determining the feasibility of the task and how style information is encoded within model representations. Then, we evaluate various prompting strategies and inference-time interventions for steering model generations towards a personalized style, with a particular focus on contrastive steering with sparse autoencoder (SAE) latents to identify salient personalization properties. We demonstrate that contrastive SAE steering yields robust style conditioning and translation quality, resulting in higher inference-time computational efficiency than prompting approaches. We further examine the impact of steering on model activations, finding that layers encoding personalization properties are impacted similarly by prompting and SAE steering, suggesting a similar mechanism at play.</description>

      <title>Your Pre-trained LLM is Secretly an Unsupervised Confidence Calibrator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-training of large language models is essential for adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) to align with human preferences and downstream tasks. While PLMs typically exhibit well-calibrated confidence, post-trained language models (PoLMs) often suffer from over-confidence, assigning high confidence to both correct and incorrect outputs, which can undermine reliability in critical applications. A major obstacle in calibrating PoLMs is the scarcity of labeled data for individual downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Disagreement-Aware Confidence Alignment (DACA), a novel unsupervised method to optimize the parameters (e.g., temperature $\tau$) in post-hoc confidence calibration. Our method is motivated by the under-confidence issue caused by prediction disagreement between the PLM and PoLM while aligning their confidence via temperature scaling. Theoretically, the PLM's confidence underestimates PoLM's prediction accuracy on disagreement examples, causing a larger $\tau$ and producing under-confident predictions. DACA mitigates this by selectively using only agreement examples for calibration, effectively decoupling the influence of disagreement. In this manner, our method avoids an overly large $\tau$ in temperature scaling caused by disagreement examples, improving calibration performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, improving the average ECE of open-sourced and API-based LLMs (e.g. GPT-4o) by up to 15.08$\%$ on common benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Protein Design with Dynamic Protein Vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein design is a fundamental challenge in biotechnology, aiming to design novel sequences with specific functions within the vast space of possible proteins. Recent advances in deep generative models have enabled function-based protein design from textual descriptions, yet struggle with structural plausibility. Inspired by classical protein design methods that leverage natural protein structures, we explore whether incorporating fragments from natural proteins can enhance foldability in generative models. Our empirical results show that even random incorporation of fragments improves foldability. Building on this insight, we introduce ProDVa, a novel protein design approach that integrates a text encoder for functional descriptions, a protein language model for designing proteins, and a fragment encoder to dynamically retrieve protein fragments based on textual functional descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively designs protein sequences that are both functionally aligned and structurally plausible. Compared to state-of-the-art models, ProDVa achieves comparable function alignment using less than 0.04% of the training data, while designing significantly more well-folded proteins, with the proportion of proteins having pLDDT above 70 increasing by 7.38% and those with PAE below 10 increasing by 9.6%.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Importance Sampling to Detach Alignment Modules from Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) across industries has increased the demand for high-quality and customizable outputs. However, traditional alignment methods often require retraining large pretrained models, making it difficult to quickly adapt and optimize LLMs for diverse applications. To address this limitation, we propose a novel \textit{Residual Alignment Model} (\textit{RAM}) that formalizes the alignment process as a type of importance sampling. In this framework, the unaligned upstream model serves as the proposal distribution, while the alignment process is framed as secondary sampling based on an autoregressive alignment module that acts as an estimator of the importance weights. This design enables a natural detachment of the alignment module from the target aligned model, improving flexibility and scalability. Based on this model, we derive an efficient sequence-level training strategy for the alignment module, which operates independently of the proposal module. Additionally, we develop a resampling algorithm with iterative token-level decoding to address the common first-token latency issue in comparable methods. Experimental evaluations on two leading open-source LLMs across diverse tasks, including instruction following, domain adaptation, and preference optimization, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baseline models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21391v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear TD($\lambda$) is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms for policy evaluation. Previously, convergence rates are typically established under the assumption of linearly independent features, which does not hold in many practical scenarios. This paper instead establishes the first $L^2$ convergence rates for linear TD($\lambda$) operating under arbitrary features, without making any algorithmic modification or additional assumptions. Our results apply to both the discounted and average-reward settings. To address the potential non-uniqueness of solutions resulting from arbitrary features, we develop a novel stochastic approximation result featuring convergence rates to the solution set instead of a single point.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Reason Structurally? An Evaluation via the Lens of Data Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) take on increasingly complex tasks, understanding their algorithmic reasoning abilities has become essential. However, existing evaluations focus on distinct and isolated tasks. We propose a unified diagnostic lens: structural reasoning--understanding and manipulating relationships like order, hierarchy, and connectivity. We introduce DSR-Bench, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate LLM structural reasoning through canonical data structures, which serve as interpretable, algorithmically meaningful abstractions. DSR-Bench spans 20 data structures, 35 operations, and 4,140 synthetically generated problem instances with minimal contamination. The benchmark's hierarchical design pinpoints specific failure modes, while its fully automated evaluation ensures objective and consistent assessment. Benchmarking ten state-of-the-art LLMs reveals critical limitations: the top-performing model scores only 0.498 out of 1 on challenging instances. Three additional evaluation suites reveal further weaknesses: models perform poorly on spatial data and natural language scenarios, and fail to reason over their own generated code. DSR-Bench offers a principled diagnostic tool for structural reasoning, helping expose reasoning bottlenecks and guide the development of more capable and reliable LLMs.</description>

      <title>EvolveNav: Empowering LLM-Based Vision-Language Navigation via Self-Improving Embodied Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed the potential of training open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning ability for enhancing vision-language navigation (VLN) performance, and simultaneously mitigate the domain gap between LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these approaches predominantly adopt straightforward input-output mapping paradigms, causing the mapping learning difficult and the navigational decisions unexplainable. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve both navigational decision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity of the navigation task makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to overfitting through pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose EvolveNav, a novel sElf-improving embodied reasoning paradigm that realizes adaptable and generalizable navigational reasoning for boosting LLM-based vision-language Navigation. Specifically, EvolveNav involves a two-stage training process: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we train the model with curated formalized CoT labels to first activate the model's navigational reasoning capabilities, and simultaneously increase the reasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective Post-Training, where the model is iteratively trained with its own reasoning outputs as self-enriched CoT labels to enhance the supervision diversity. A self-reflective auxiliary task is also designed to encourage the model to learn correct reasoning patterns by contrasting with wrong ones. Experimental results under both task-specific and cross-task training paradigms demonstrate the consistent superiority of EvolveNav over previous LLM-based VLN approaches on various popular benchmarks, including R2R, REVERIE, CVDN, and SOON.

      <title>Uncertainty Estimation on Graphs with Structure Informed Stochastic Partial Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have achieved impressive results across diverse network modeling tasks, but accurately estimating uncertainty on graphs remains difficult, especially under distributional shifts. Unlike traditional uncertainty estimation, graph-based uncertainty must account for randomness arising from both the graph's structure and its label distribution, which adds complexity. In this paper, making an analogy between the evolution of a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven by Matern Gaussian Process and message passing using GNN layers, we present a principled way to design a novel message passing scheme that incorporates spatial-temporal noises motivated by the Gaussian Process approach to SPDE. Our method simultaneously captures uncertainty across space and time and allows explicit control over the covariance kernel smoothness, thereby enhancing uncertainty estimates on graphs with both low and high label informativeness. Our extensive experiments on Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection on graph datasets with varying label informativeness demonstrate the soundness and superiority of our model to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>BridgeVLA: Input-Output Alignment for Efficient 3D Manipulation Learning with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) for building vision-language-action (VLA) models has emerged as a promising approach to effective robot manipulation learning. However, only few methods incorporate 3D signals into VLMs for action prediction, and they do not fully leverage the spatial structure inherent in 3D data, leading to low sample efficiency. In this paper, we introduce BridgeVLA, a novel 3D VLA model that (1) projects 3D inputs to multiple 2D images, ensuring input alignment with the VLM backbone, and (2) utilizes 2D heatmaps for action prediction, unifying the input and output spaces within a consistent 2D image space. In addition, we propose a scalable pre-training method that equips the VLM backbone with the capability to predict 2D heatmaps before downstream policy learning. Extensive experiments show the proposed method is able to learn 3D manipulation efficiently and effectively. BridgeVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across three simulation benchmarks. In RLBench, it improves the average success rate from 81.4% to 88.2%. In COLOSSEUM, it demonstrates significantly better performance in challenging generalization settings, boosting the average success rate from 56.7% to 64.0%. In GemBench, it surpasses all the comparing baseline methods in terms of average success rate. In real-robot experiments, BridgeVLA outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline method by 32% on average. It generalizes robustly in multiple out-of-distribution settings, including visual disturbances and unseen instructions. Remarkably, it is able to achieve a success rate of 96.8% on 10+ tasks with only 3 trajectories per task, highlighting its extraordinary sample efficiency.

      <title>Time-IMM: A Dataset and Benchmark for Irregular Multimodal Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However, existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data, creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation. IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blacksnail789521/time-imm/data, and the benchmark library can be accessed at https://github.com/blacksnail789521/IMM-TSF.</description>

      <title>VIDEE: Visual and Interactive Decomposition, Execution, and Evaluation of Text Analytics with Intelligent Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21582v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text analytics has traditionally required specialized knowledge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) or text analysis, which presents a barrier for entry-level analysts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.). We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1) Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution, which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation, which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience -- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics systems.</description>

      <title>SPADE: Spatial Transcriptomics and Pathology Alignment Using a Mixture of Data Experts for an Expressive Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep learning have enabled the development of foundational models for various pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin &amp; eosin (H&amp;E) staining. We introduce SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique, where experts are created via two-stage imaging feature-space clustering using contrastive learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is evaluated on 20 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space. Code and pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/uclabair/SPADE.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design in Nanophotonics via Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse design in nanophotonics, the computational discovery of structures achieving targeted electromagnetic (EM) responses, has become a key tool for recent optical advances. Traditional intuition-driven or iterative optimization methods struggle with the inherently high-dimensional, non-convex design spaces and the substantial computational demands of EM simulations. Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged to address these bottlenecks effectively. This review frames ML-enhanced inverse design methodologies through the lens of representation learning, classifying them into two categories: output-side and input-side approaches. Output-side methods use ML to learn a representation in the solution space to create a differentiable solver that accelerates optimization. Conversely, input-side techniques employ ML to learn compact, latent-space representations of feasible device geometries, enabling efficient global exploration through generative models. Each strategy presents unique trade-offs in data requirements, generalization capacity, and novel design discovery potentials. Hybrid frameworks that combine physics-based optimization with data-driven representations help escape poor local optima, improve scalability, and facilitate knowledge transfer. We conclude by highlighting open challenges and opportunities, emphasizing complexity management, geometry-independent representations, integration of fabrication constraints, and advancements in multiphysics co-designs.</description>

      <title>SAFER: Probing Safety in Reward Models with Sparse Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a key paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, yet the reward models at its core remain largely opaque. In this work, we present sparse Autoencoder For Enhanced Reward model (\textbf{SAFER}), a novel framework for interpreting and improving reward models through mechanistic analysis. Leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), we uncover human-interpretable features in reward model activations, enabling insight into safety-relevant decision-making. We apply SAFER to safety-oriented preference datasets and quantify the salience of individual features by activation differences between chosen and rejected responses. Using these feature-level signals, we design targeted data poisoning and denoising strategies. Experiments show that SAFER can precisely degrade or enhance safety alignment with minimal data modification, without sacrificing general chat performance. Our approach contributes to interpreting, auditing and refining reward models in high-stakes LLM alignment tasks. Our codes are available at https://github.com/xzy-101/SAFER-code. \textit{This paper discusses topics related to large language model safety and may include discussions or examples that highlight potential risks or unsafe outcomes.}</description>

      <title>Dual Perspectives on Non-Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The {\em stop gradient} and {\em exponential moving average} iterative procedures are commonly used in non-contrastive approaches to self-supervised learning to avoid representation collapse, with excellent performance in downstream applications in practice. This presentation investigates these procedures from the dual viewpoints of optimization and dynamical systems. We show that, in general, although they {\em do not} optimize the original objective, or {\em any} other smooth function, they {\em do} avoid collapse Following~\citet{Tian21}, but without any of the extra assumptions used in their proofs, we then show using a dynamical system perspective that, in the linear case, minimizing the original objective function without the use of a stop gradient or exponential moving average {\em always} leads to collapse. Conversely, we characterize explicitly the equilibria of the dynamical systems associated with these two procedures in this linear setting as algebraic varieties in their parameter space, and show that they are, in general, {\em asymptotically stable}. Our theoretical findings are illustrated by empirical experiments with real and synthetic data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04295v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective feedback is essential for student learning but is time-intensive for teachers. We present LearnLens, a modular, LLM-based system that generates personalised, curriculum-aligned feedback in science education. LearnLens comprises three components: (1) an error-aware assessment module that captures nuanced reasoning errors; (2) a curriculum-grounded generation module that uses a structured, topic-linked memory chain rather than traditional similarity-based retrieval, improving relevance and reducing noise; and (3) an educator-in-the-loop interface for customisation and oversight. LearnLens addresses key challenges in existing systems, offering scalable, high-quality feedback that empowers both teachers and students.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Fusion via Bidirectional Information Aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are the cornerstone of the semantic web, offering up-to-date representations of real-world entities and relations. Yet large language models (LLMs) remain largely static after pre-training, causing their internal knowledge to become outdated and limiting their utility in time-sensitive web applications. To bridge this gap between dynamic knowledge and static models, a prevalent approach is to enhance LLMs with KGs. However, prevailing methods typically rely on parameter-invasive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and often degrades LLMs' general capabilities. Moreover, their static integration frameworks cannot keep pace with the continuous evolution of real-world KGs, hindering their deployment in dynamic web environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce KGA (\textit{\underline{K}nowledge \underline{G}raph-guided \underline{A}ttention}), a novel framework that dynamically integrates external KGs into LLMs exclusively at inference-time without any parameter modification. Inspired by research on neuroscience, we rewire the self-attention module by innovatively introducing two synergistic pathways: a \textit{bottom-up knowledge fusion} pathway and a \textit{top-down attention guidance} pathway. The \textit{bottom-up pathway} dynamically integrates external knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion, which is akin to the \textit{stimulus-driven attention process} in the human brain. Complementarily, the \textit{top-down pathway} aims to assess the contextual relevance of each triple through a \textit{goal-directed verification process}, thereby suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying knowledge-relevant patterns. By synergistically combining these two pathways, our method supports real-time knowledge fusion. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks verify KGA's strong fusion performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Feature Distillation is the Better Choice for Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning (Hetero-FL) has attracted growing attention for its ability to aggregate knowledge from heterogeneous models while keeping private data locally. To better aggregate knowledge from clients, ensemble distillation, as a widely used and effective technique, is often employed after global aggregation to enhance the performance of the global model. However, simply combining Hetero-FL and ensemble distillation does not always yield promising results and can make the training process unstable. The reason is that existing methods primarily focus on logit distillation, which, while being model-agnostic with softmax predictions, fails to compensate for the knowledge bias arising from heterogeneous models. To tackle this challenge, we propose a stable and efficient Feature Distillation for model-heterogeneous Federated learning, dubbed FedFD, that can incorporate aligned feature information via orthogonal projection to integrate knowledge from heterogeneous models better. Specifically, a new feature-based ensemble federated knowledge distillation paradigm is proposed. The global model on the server needs to maintain a projection layer for each client-side model architecture to align the features separately. Orthogonal techniques are employed to re-parameterize the projection layer to mitigate knowledge bias from heterogeneous models and thus maximize the distilled knowledge. Extensive experiments show that FedFD achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Finding Dori: Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Is Not Local</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in image generation. However, concerns about data privacy and intellectual property remain due to their potential to inadvertently memorize and replicate training data. Recent mitigation efforts have focused on identifying and pruning weights responsible for triggering verbatim training data replication, based on the assumption that memorization can be localized. We challenge this assumption and demonstrate that, even after such pruning, small perturbations to the text embeddings of previously mitigated prompts can re-trigger data replication, revealing the fragility of such defenses. Our further analysis then provides multiple indications that memorization is indeed not inherently local: (1) replication triggers for memorized images are distributed throughout text embedding space; (2) embeddings yielding the same replicated image produce divergent model activations; and (3) different pruning methods identify inconsistent sets of memorization-related weights for the same image. Finally, we show that bypassing the locality assumption enables more robust mitigation through adversarial fine-tuning. These findings provide new insights into the nature of memorization in text-to-image DMs and inform the development of more reliable mitigations against DM memorization.</description>

      <title>A Cooperative Approach for Knowledge-based Business Process Design in a Public Authority</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enterprises are currently undergoing profound transformations due to the unpostponable digital transformation. Then, to remain competitive, enterprises must adapt digital solutions, transforming their organisational structures and operations. This organisational shift is also important for small and medium-sized enterprises. A key innovation frontier is the adoption of process-oriented production models. This paper presents a knowledge-based method to support business experts in designing business processes. The method requires no prior expertise in Knowledge Engineering and guides designers through a structured sequence of steps to produce a diagrammatic workflow of the target process. The construction of the knowledge base starts from simple, text-based, knowledge artefacts and then progresses towards more structured, formal representations. The approach has been conceived to allow a shared approach for all stakeholders and actors who participate in the BP design.</description>

      <title>Capturing More: Learning Multi-Domain Representations for Robust Online Handwriting Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose SPECTRUM, a temporal-frequency synergistic model that unlocks the untapped potential of multi-domain representation learning for online handwriting verification (OHV). SPECTRUM comprises three core components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration. (3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains.

      <title>mmWave Radar-Based Non-Line-of-Sight Pedestrian Localization at T-Junctions Utilizing Road Layout Extraction via Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pedestrians Localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) regions within urban environments poses a significant challenge for autonomous driving systems. While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult. Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.</description>

      <title>DMSC: Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch, inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for TSF tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/1327679995/DMSC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) power numerous AI applications, yet updating their knowledge remains costly. Model editing provides a lightweight alternative through targeted parameter modifications, with meta-learning-based model editing (MLME) demonstrating strong effectiveness and efficiency. However, we find that MLME struggles in low-data regimes and incurs high training costs due to the use of KL divergence. To address these issues, we propose $\textbf{E}$fficient $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{S}$tep $\textbf{Edit (EMSEdit)}$, which leverages multi-step backpropagation (MSBP) to effectively capture gradient-activation mapping patterns within editing samples, performs multi-step edits per sample to enhance editing performance under limited data, and introduces norm-based regularization to preserve unedited knowledge while improving training efficiency. Experiments on two datasets and three LLMs show that EMSEdit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both sequential and batch editing. Moreover, MSBP can be seamlessly integrated into existing approaches to yield additional performance gains. Further experiments on a multi-hop reasoning editing task demonstrate EMSEdit's robustness in handling complex edits, while ablation studies validate the contribution of each design component.

      <title>An Introduction to Sliced Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sliced Optimal Transport (SOT) is a rapidly developing branch of optimal transport (OT) that exploits the tractability of one-dimensional OT problems. By combining tools from OT, integral geometry, and computational statistics, SOT enables fast and scalable computation of distances, barycenters, and kernels for probability measures, while retaining rich geometric structure. This paper provides a comprehensive review of SOT, covering its mathematical foundations, methodological advances, computational methods, and applications. We discuss key concepts of OT and one-dimensional OT, the role of tools from integral geometry such as Radon transform in projecting measures, and statistical techniques for estimating sliced distances. The paper further explores recent methodological advances, including non-linear projections, improved Monte Carlo approximations, statistical estimation techniques for one-dimensional optimal transport, weighted slicing techniques, and transportation plan estimation methods. Variational problems, such as minimum sliced Wasserstein estimation, barycenters, gradient flows, kernel constructions, and embeddings are examined alongside extensions to unbalanced, partial, multi-marginal, and Gromov-Wasserstein settings. Applications span machine learning, statistics, computer graphics and computer visions, highlighting SOT's versatility as a practical computational tool. This work will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in machine learning, data sciences, and computational disciplines seeking efficient alternatives to classical OT.</description>

      <title>AdaptJobRec: Enhancing Conversational Career Recommendation through an LLM-Powered Agentic System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, recommendation systems have evolved from providing a single list of recommendations to offering a comprehensive suite of topic focused services. To better accomplish this task, conversational recommendation systems (CRS) have progressed from basic retrieval augmented LLM generation to agentic systems with advanced reasoning and self correction capabilities. However, agentic systems come with notable response latency, a longstanding challenge for conversational recommendation systems. To balance the trade off between handling complex queries and minimizing latency, we propose AdaptJobRec, the first conversational job recommendation system that leverages autonomous agent to integrate personalized recommendation algorithm tools. The system employs a user query complexity identification mechanism to minimize response latency. For straightforward queries, the agent directly selects the appropriate tool for rapid responses. For complex queries, the agent uses the memory processing module to filter chat history for relevant content, then passes the results to the intelligent task decomposition planner, and finally executes the tasks using personalized recommendation tools. Evaluation on Walmart's real world career recommendation scenarios demonstrates that AdaptJobRec reduces average response latency by up to 53.3% compared to competitive baselines, while significantly improving recommendation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Hard Examples Are All You Need: Maximizing GRPO Post-Training Under Annotation Budgets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14094v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collecting high-quality training examples for language model fine-tuning is expensive, with practical budgets limiting the amount of data that can be procured. We investigate whether example difficulty affects GRPO training effectiveness by comparing selection strategies (easy, medium, hard, random) across multiple models and reasoning tasks. Training on the hardest 10\% of examples (those where the base model fails most often) yields dramatic performance gains up to 47\%, while easy examples produce minimal improvements of 3-15\%. This occurs because GRPO requires outcome variance to generate learning signals; hard examples maintain mixed success/failure outcomes throughout training while easy examples quickly converge to consistent success, eliminating learning opportunities. Moreover, models trained on hard examples show superior out-of-distribution generalization, with only hard-trained models achieving meaningful gains on the AIME2025 benchmark. Our findings provide clear guidance: when budget-constrained, prioritize collecting and annotating examples where your base model struggles, as these drive nearly all learning value in GRPO fine-tuning</description>

      <title>NinA: Normalizing Flows in Action. Training VLA Models with Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive alternative to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without compromising performance.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Language Models Know the Answer Before Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19982v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as an alternative to autoregressive approaches, offering parallel sequence generation and flexible token orders. However, their inference remains slower than that of autoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and the large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this work, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer convergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by half steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and random remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99% of instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the refinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a training-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding. Specifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to go "all-in" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the confidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It integrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible overhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of LLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the number of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation quality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop sampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing speedup techniques.

      <title>Attention as an Adaptive Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Filter Attention (AFA), a novel attention mechanism that incorporates a learnable dynamics model directly into the computation of attention weights. Rather than comparing queries and keys directly, we model the input sequence as discrete observations of a linear stochastic differential equation (SDE). By assuming a continuous-time linear time-invariant system with simultaneously-diagonalizable state matrices and noise covariances, we can make use of a closed-form solution of the differential Lyapunov equation to efficiently propagate uncertainties through the dynamics from keys to queries. A generalization of attention naturally arises as the maximum likelihood solution for filtering the trajectory of this linear SDE, with attention weights corresponding to robust residual-based reweightings of the propagated query-key precisions. We further constrain the system dynamics and noise in order to obtain a simplified variant with the same computational and memory complexity as standard attention. In the limit of zero decay and process noise, and using a small-angle approximation, we recover a complex-valued generalization of ordinary dot-product attention with rotary positional encodings.</description>

      <title>General Demographic Foundation Models for Enhancing Predictive Performance Across Diseases and Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Demographic attributes are universally present in electronic health records. They are the most widespread information across populations and diseases, and serve as vital predictors in clinical risk stratification and treatment decisions. Despite their significance, these attributes are often treated as auxiliaries in model design, with limited attention being paid to learning their representations. This study explored the development of a General Demographic Pre-trained (GDP) model as a foundational model tailored to demographic attributes, focusing on age and gender. The model is pre-trained and evaluated using datasets with diverse diseases and populations compositions from different geographic regions. The composition of GDP architecture was explored through examining combinations of ordering approaches and encoding methods to transform tabular demographic inputs into effective latent embeddings. Results demonstrate the feasibility of GDP to generalize across task, diseases, and populations. In detailed composition, the sequential ordering substantially improves model performance in discrimination, calibration, and the corresponding information gain at each decision tree split, particularly in diseases where age and gender contribute significantly to risk stratification. Even in datasets where demographic attributes hold relatively low predictive value, GDP enhances the representational importance, increasing their influence in downstream gradient boosting models. The findings suggest that foundation models for tabular demographic attributes offer a promising direction for improving predictive performance in healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>StegOT: Trade-offs in Steganography via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image hiding is often referred to as steganography, which aims to hide a secret image in a cover image of the same resolution. Many steganography models are based on genera-tive adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs). However, most existing models suffer from mode collapse. Mode collapse will lead to an information imbalance between the cover and secret images in the stego image and further affect the subsequent extraction. To address these challenges, this paper proposes StegOT, an autoencoder-based steganography model incorporating optimal transport theory. We designed the multiple channel optimal transport (MCOT) module to transform the feature distribution, which exhibits multiple peaks, into a single peak to achieve the trade-off of information. Experiments demonstrate that we not only achieve a trade-off between the cover and secret images but also enhance the quality of both the stego and recovery images. The source code will be released on https://github.com/Rss1124/StegOT.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Versatile Model for Multilingual Information Retrieval of Islamic Text: Development and Deployment in Real-World Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in Multilingual Information Retrieval (MLIR), a significant gap remains between research and practical deployment. Many studies assess MLIR performance in isolated settings, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we leverage the unique characteristics of the Quranic multilingual corpus to examine the optimal strategies to develop an ad-hoc IR system for the Islamic domain that is designed to satisfy users' information needs in multiple languages. We prepared eleven retrieval models employing four training approaches: monolingual, cross-lingual, translate-train-all, and a novel mixed method combining cross-lingual and monolingual techniques. Evaluation on an in-domain dataset demonstrates that the mixed approach achieves promising results across diverse retrieval scenarios. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of how different training configurations affect the embedding space and their implications for multilingual retrieval effectiveness. Finally, we discuss deployment considerations, emphasizing the cost-efficiency of deploying a single versatile, lightweight model for real-world MLIR applications.</description>

      <title>TISDiSS: A Training-Time and Inference-Time Scalable Framework for Discriminative Source Separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15666v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Source separation is a fundamental task in speech, music, and audio processing, and it also provides cleaner and larger data for training generative models. However, improving separation performance in practice often depends on increasingly large networks, inflating training and deployment costs. Motivated by recent advances in inference-time scaling for generative modeling, we propose Training-Time and Inference-Time Scalable Discriminative Source Separation (TISDiSS), a unified framework that integrates early-split multi-loss supervision, shared-parameter design, and dynamic inference repetitions. TISDiSS enables flexible speed-performance trade-offs by adjusting inference depth without retraining additional models. We further provide systematic analyses of architectural and training choices and show that training with more inference repetitions improves shallow-inference performance, benefiting low-latency applications. Experiments on standard speech separation benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with a reduced parameter count, establishing TISDiSS as a scalable and practical framework for adaptive source separation.

      <title>SPiDR: A Simple Approach for Zero-Shot Safety in Sim-to-Real Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) safely in the real world is challenging, as policies trained in simulators must face the inevitable sim-to-real gap. Robust safe RL techniques are provably safe, however difficult to scale, while domain randomization is more practical yet prone to unsafe behaviors. We address this gap by proposing SPiDR, short for Sim-to-real via Pessimistic Domain Randomization -- a scalable algorithm with provable guarantees for safe sim-to-real transfer. SPiDR uses domain randomization to incorporate the uncertainty about the sim-to-real gap into the safety constraints, making it versatile and highly compatible with existing training pipelines. Through extensive experiments on sim-to-sim benchmarks and two distinct real-world robotic platforms, we demonstrate that SPiDR effectively ensures safety despite the sim-to-real gap while maintaining strong performance.</description>

      <title>A Longitudinal Randomized Control Study of Companion Chatbot Use: Anthropomorphism and Its Mediating Role on Social Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19515v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots are designed and used for companionship, and people have reported forming friendships, mentorships, and romantic partnerships with them. Concerns that companion chatbots may harm or replace real human relationships have been raised, but whether and how these social consequences occur remains unclear. In the present longitudinal study ($N = 183$), participants were randomly assigned to a chatbot condition (text chat with a companion chatbot) or to a control condition (text-based word games) for 10 minutes a day for 21 days. Participants also completed four surveys during the 21 days and engaged in audio recorded interviews on day 1 and 21. Overall, social health and relationships were not significantly impacted by companion chatbot interactions across 21 days of use. However, a detailed analysis showed a different story. People who had a higher desire to socially connect also tended to anthropomorphize the chatbot more, attributing humanlike properties to it; and those who anthropomorphized the chatbot more also reported that talking to the chatbot had a greater impact on their social interactions and relationships with family and friends. Via a mediation analysis, our results suggest a key mechanism at work: the impact of human-AI interaction on human-human social outcomes is mediated by the extent to which people anthropomorphize the AI agent, which is in turn motivated by a desire to socially connect. In a world where the desire to socially connect is on the rise, this finding may be cause for concern.</description>

Abstract: KT developed a Responsible AI (RAI) assessment methodology and risk mitigation technologies to ensure the safety and reliability of AI services. By analyzing the Basic Act on AI implementation and global AI governance trends, we established a unique approach for regulatory compliance and systematically identify and manage all potential risk factors from AI development to operation. We present a reliable assessment methodology that systematically verifies model safety and robustness based on KT's AI risk taxonomy tailored to the domestic environment. We also provide practical tools for managing and mitigating identified AI risks. With the release of this report, we also release proprietary Guardrail : SafetyGuard that blocks harmful responses from AI models in real-time, supporting the enhancement of safety in the domestic AI development ecosystem. We also believe these research outcomes provide valuable insights for organizations seeking to develop Responsible AI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Large language models (LLMs) have proven performance for certain diagnostic tasks, however limited studies have evaluated their consistency in recommending appropriate medication regimens for a given diagnosis. Medication management is a complex task that requires synthesis of drug formulation and complete order instructions for safe use. Here, the performance of GPT 4o, an LLM available with ChatGPT, was tested for three medication management tasks. Methods: GPT-4o performance was tested using three medication tasks: identifying available formulations for a given generic drug name, identifying drug-drug interactions (DDI) for a given medication regimen, and preparing a medication order for a given generic drug name. For each experiment, the models raw text response was captured exactly as returned and evaluated using clinician evaluation in addition to standard LLM metrics, including Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF IDF) vectors, normalized Levenshtein similarity, and Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE 1/ROUGE L F1) between each response and its reference string. Results: For the first task of drug-formulation matching, GPT-4o had 49% accuracy for generic medications being matched to all available formulations, with an average of 1.23 omissions per medication and 1.14 hallucinations per medication. For the second task of drug-drug interaction identification, the accuracy was 54.7% for identifying the DDI pair. For the third task, GPT-4o generated order sentences containing no medication or abbreviation errors in 65.8% of cases. Conclusions: Model performance for basic medication tasks was consistently poor. This evaluation highlights the need for domain-specific training through clinician-annotated datasets and a comprehensive evaluation framework for benchmarking performance.</description>

      <title>Understanding Language Prior of LVLMs by Contrasting Chain-of-Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks, yet they often default to their language prior (LP) -- memorized textual patterns from pre-training while under-utilizing visual evidence. Prior analyses of LP mostly rely on input-output probing, which fails to reveal the internal mechanisms governing when and how vision influences model behavior. To address this gap, we present the first systematic analysis of language prior through the lens of chain-of-embedding, which examines the layer-wise representation dynamics within LVLMs. Our analysis reveals a universal phenomenon: each model exhibits a Visual Integration Point (VIP), a critical layer at which visual information begins to meaningfully reshape hidden representations and influence decoding. Building on this observation, we introduce the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator, which aggregates representation distance beyond the VIP to quantify how strongly visual query influences response generation. Across 54 model-dataset combinations spanning 9 contemporary LVLMs and 6 benchmarks, we demonstrate that VIP consistently emerges, and that TVI reliably predicts the strength of language prior. This offers a principled toolkit for diagnosing and understanding language prior in LVLMs.</description>

      <title>Graph2Eval: Automatic Multimodal Task Generation for Agents via Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As multimodal LLM-driven agents continue to advance in autonomy and generalization, evaluation based on static datasets can no longer adequately assess their true capabilities in dynamic environments and diverse tasks. Existing LLM-based synthetic data methods are largely designed for LLM training and evaluation, and thus cannot be directly applied to agent tasks that require tool use and interactive capabilities. While recent studies have explored automatic agent task generation with LLMs, most efforts remain limited to text or image analysis, without systematically modeling multi-step interactions in web environments. To address these challenges, we propose Graph2Eval, a knowledge graph-based framework that automatically generates both multimodal document comprehension tasks and web interaction tasks, enabling comprehensive evaluation of agents' reasoning, collaboration, and interactive capabilities. In our approach, knowledge graphs constructed from multi-source external data serve as the task space, where we translate semantic relations into structured multimodal tasks using subgraph sampling, task templates, and meta-paths. A multi-stage filtering pipeline based on node reachability, LLM scoring, and similarity analysis is applied to guarantee the quality and executability of the generated tasks. Furthermore, Graph2Eval supports end-to-end evaluation of multiple agent types (Single-Agent, Multi-Agent, Web Agent) and measures reasoning, collaboration, and interaction capabilities. We instantiate the framework with Graph2Eval-Bench, a curated dataset of 1,319 tasks spanning document comprehension and web interaction scenarios. Experiments show that Graph2Eval efficiently generates tasks that differentiate agent and model performance, revealing gaps in reasoning, collaboration, and web interaction across different settings and offering a new perspective for agent evaluation.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization: mini-critics boost LLM reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most recent RL for LLMs (RL4LLM) methods avoid explicit critics, replacing them with average advantage baselines. This shift is largely pragmatic: conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO, achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.</description>

      <title>PolySim: Bridging the Sim-to-Real Gap for Humanoid Control via Multi-Simulator Dynamics Randomization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humanoid whole-body control (WBC) policies trained in simulation often suffer from the sim-to-real gap, which fundamentally arises from simulator inductive bias, the inherent assumptions and limitations of any single simulator. These biases lead to nontrivial discrepancies both across simulators and between simulation and the real world. To mitigate the effect of simulator inductive bias, the key idea is to train policies jointly across multiple simulators, encouraging the learned controller to capture dynamics that generalize beyond any single simulator's assumptions. We thus introduce PolySim, a WBC training platform that integrates multiple heterogeneous simulators. PolySim can launch parallel environments from different engines simultaneously within a single training run, thereby realizing dynamics-level domain randomization. Theoretically, we show that PolySim yields a tighter upper bound on simulator inductive bias than single-simulator training. In experiments, PolySim substantially reduces motion-tracking error in sim-to-sim evaluations; for example, on MuJoCo, it improves execution success by 52.8 over an IsaacSim baseline. PolySim further enables zero-shot deployment on a real Unitree G1 without additional fine-tuning, showing effective transfer from simulation to the real world. We will release the PolySim code upon acceptance of this work.</description>

      <title>General Exploratory Bonus for Optimistic Exploration in RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimistic exploration is central to improving sample efficiency in reinforcement learning with human feedback, yet existing exploratory bonus methods to incentivize exploration often fail to realize optimism. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that current formulations, under KL or $\alpha$-divergence regularization, unintentionally bias exploration toward high-probability regions of the reference model, thereby reinforcing conservative behavior instead of promoting discovery of uncertain regions. To address this pitfall, we introduce the General Exploratory Bonus (GEB), a novel theoretical framework that provably satisfies the optimism principle. GEB counteracts divergence-induced bias via reference-dependent reward regulation and unifies prior heuristic bonuses as special cases, while extending naturally across the full $\alpha$-divergence family. Empirically, GEB consistently outperforms baselines on alignment tasks across multiple divergence settings and large language model backbones. These results demonstrate that GEB offers both a principled and practical solution for optimistic exploration in RLHF.</description>

      <title>Triplet-Structured Knowledge Integration for Multi-Turn Medical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on static medical Question Answering (QA) tasks, yet their reasoning often deteriorates in multi-turn clinical dialogues where patient information is scattered across turns. This paper introduces TriMediQ, a triplet-structured approach that enhances the reasoning reliability of LLMs through explicit knowledge integration. TriMediQ first employs a frozen triplet extraction LLM to convert patient responses into clinically grounded triplets, ensuring factual precision via constrained prompting. These triplets are incorporated into a patient-specific Knowledge Graph (KG), from which a trainable projection module consisting of a graph encoder and a projector captures relational dependencies while keeping all LLM parameters frozen. During inference, the projection module guides multi-hop reasoning over the KG, enabling coherent clinical dialogue understanding. Experiments on two interactive medical QA benchmarks show that TriMediQ achieves up to 10.4\% improvement in accuracy over five existing baselines on the iMedQA dataset. These results demonstrate that structuring patient information as triplets can effectively improve the reasoning capability of LLMs in multi-turn medical QA.</description>

      <title>Neon: Negative Extrapolation From Self-Training Improves Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling generative AI models is bottlenecked by the scarcity of high-quality training data. The ease of synthesizing from a generative model suggests using (unverified) synthetic data to augment a limited corpus of real data for the purpose of fine-tuning in the hope of improving performance. Unfortunately, however, the resulting positive feedback loop leads to model autophagy disorder (MAD, aka model collapse) that results in a rapid degradation in sample quality and/or diversity. In this paper, we introduce Neon (for Negative Extrapolation frOm self-traiNing), a new learning method that turns the degradation from self-training into a powerful signal for self-improvement. Given a base model, Neon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then, counterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the degraded weights. We prove that Neon works because typical inference samplers that favor high-probability regions create a predictable anti-alignment between the synthetic and real data population gradients, which negative extrapolation corrects to better align the model with the true data distribution. Neon is remarkably easy to implement via a simple post-hoc merge that requires no new real data, works effectively with as few as 1k synthetic samples, and typically uses less than 1% additional training compute. We demonstrate Neon's universality across a range of architectures (diffusion, flow matching, autoregressive, and inductive moment matching models) and datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, Neon elevates the xAR-L model to a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.02 with only 0.36% additional training compute.

      <title>AgentBuilder: Exploring Scaffolds for Prototyping User Experiences of Interface Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interface agents powered by generative AI models (referred to as "agents") can automate actions based on user commands. An important aspect of developing agents is their user experience (i.e., agent experience). There is a growing need to provide scaffolds for a broader set of individuals beyond AI engineers to prototype agent experiences, since they can contribute valuable perspectives to designing agent experiences. In this work, we explore the affordances agent prototyping systems should offer by conducting a requirements elicitation study with 12 participants with varying experience with agents. We identify key activities in agent experience prototyping and the desired capabilities of agent prototyping systems. We instantiate those capabilities in the AgentBuilder design probe for agent prototyping. We conduct an in situ agent prototyping study with 14 participants using AgentBuilder to validate the design requirements and elicit insights on how developers prototype agents and what their needs are in this process.</description>

      <title>Malice in Agentland: Down the Rabbit Hole of Backdoors in the AI Supply Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The practice of fine-tuning AI agents on data from their own interactions--such as web browsing or tool use--, while being a strong general recipe for improving agentic capabilities, also introduces a critical security vulnerability within the AI supply chain. In this work, we show that adversaries can easily poison the data collection pipeline to embed hard-to-detect backdoors that are triggerred by specific target phrases, such that when the agent encounters these triggers, it performs an unsafe or malicious action. We formalize and validate three realistic threat models targeting different layers of the supply chain: 1) direct poisoning of fine-tuning data, where an attacker controls a fraction of the training traces; 2) environmental poisoning, where malicious instructions are injected into webpages scraped or tools called while creating training data; and 3) supply chain poisoning, where a pre-backdoored base model is fine-tuned on clean data to improve its agentic capabilities. Our results are stark: by poisoning as few as 2% of the collected traces, an attacker can embed a backdoor causing an agent to leak confidential user information with over 80% success when a specific trigger is present. This vulnerability holds across all three threat models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prominent safeguards, including two guardrail models and one weight-based defense, fail to detect or prevent the malicious behavior. These findings highlight an urgent threat to agentic AI development and underscore the critical need for rigorous security vetting of data collection processes and end-to-end model supply chains.</description>

      <title>OptiFLIDS: Optimized Federated Learning for Energy-Efficient Intrusion Detection in IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In critical IoT environments, such as smart homes and industrial systems, effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for ensuring security. However, developing robust IDS solutions remains a significant challenge. Traditional machine learning-based IDS models typically require large datasets, but data sharing is often limited due to privacy and security concerns. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising alternative by enabling collaborative model training without sharing raw data. Despite its advantages, FL still faces key challenges, such as data heterogeneity (non-IID data) and high energy and computation costs, particularly for resource constrained IoT devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes OptiFLIDS, a novel approach that applies pruning techniques during local training to reduce model complexity and energy consumption. It also incorporates a customized aggregation method to better handle pruned models that differ due to non-IID data distributions. Experiments conducted on three recent IoT IDS datasets, TON_IoT, X-IIoTID, and IDSIoT2024, demonstrate that OptiFLIDS maintains strong detection performance while improving energy efficiency, making it well-suited for deployment in real-world IoT environments.</description>

      <title>Scalable Policy-Based RL Algorithms for POMDPs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The continuous nature of belief states in POMDPs presents significant computational challenges in learning the optimal policy. In this paper, we consider an approach that solves a Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning (PORL) problem by approximating the corresponding POMDP model into a finite-state Markov Decision Process (MDP) (called Superstate MDP). We first derive theoretical guarantees that improve upon prior work that relate the optimal value function of the transformed Superstate MDP to the optimal value function of the original POMDP. Next, we propose a policy-based learning approach with linear function approximation to learn the optimal policy for the Superstate MDP. Consequently, our approach shows that a POMDP can be approximately solved using TD-learning followed by Policy Optimization by treating it as an MDP, where the MDP state corresponds to a finite history. We show that the approximation error decreases exponentially with the length of this history. To the best of our knowledge, our finite-time bounds are the first to explicitly quantify the error introduced when applying standard TD learning to a setting where the true dynamics are not Markovian.</description>

      <title>GTCN-G: A Residual Graph-Temporal Fusion Network for Imbalanced Intrusion Detection (Preprint)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The escalating complexity of network threats and the inherent class imbalance in traffic data present formidable challenges for modern Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topological structures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient in capturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integrates both while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal Convolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these limitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting hierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core innovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism, implemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preserves original feature information through residual connections, which is critical for mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivity for rare malicious activities (minority classes). We conducted extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT, to validate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed GTCN-G model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baseline models in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effectively identifying threats and mitigating their potential damage during crisis situations, such as natural disasters or violent attacks, is paramount for safeguarding endangered individuals. To tackle these challenges, AI has been used in assisting humans in emergency situations. Still, the use of NLP techniques remains limited and mostly focuses on classification tasks. The significant potential of timely warning message generation using NLG architectures, however, has been largely overlooked. In this paper we present CrisiText, the first large-scale dataset for the generation of warning messages across 13 different types of crisis scenarios. The dataset contains more than 400,000 warning messages (spanning almost 18,000 crisis situations) aimed at assisting civilians during and after such events. To generate the dataset, we started from existing crisis descriptions and created chains of events related to the scenarios. Each event was then paired with a warning message. The generations follow experts' written guidelines to ensure correct terminology and factuality of their suggestions. Additionally, each message is accompanied by three suboptimal warning types to allow for the study of different NLG approaches. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments comparing supervised fine-tuning setups with preference alignment, zero-shot, and few-shot approaches.

      <title>ICL-Router: In-Context Learned Model Representations for LLM Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit complementary strengths. Model routing harnesses these strengths by dynamically directing each query to the most suitable model, given a candidate model pool. However, routing performance relies on accurate model representations, and adding new models typically requires retraining, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model capabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded and projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to reconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the router's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query set, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model performance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Moreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without retraining the router. The code is available at https://github.com/lalalamdbf/ICL-Router.</description>

      <title>HccePose(BF): Predicting Front &amp; Back Surfaces to Construct Ultra-Dense 2D-3D Correspondences for Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In pose estimation for seen objects, a prevalent pipeline involves using neural networks to predict dense 3D coordinates of the object surface on 2D images, which are then used to establish dense 2D-3D correspondences. However, current methods primarily focus on more efficient encoding techniques to improve the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface and interior of the object. To better utilize the full surface and interior of the object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose estimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm. Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to provide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface coordinates. Experimental results show that, compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the BOP website, the proposed approach outperforms across seven classic BOP core datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/WangYuLin-SEU/HCCEPose.</description>

      <title>The Algorithmic Regulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The regulator theorem states that, under certain conditions, any optimal controller must embody a model of the system it regulates, grounding the idea that controllers embed, explicitly or implicitly, internal models of the controlled. This principle underpins neuroscience and predictive brain theories like the Free-Energy Principle or Kolmogorov/Algorithmic Agent theory. However, the theorem is only proven in limited settings. Here, we treat the deterministic, closed, coupled world-regulator system $(W,R)$ as a single self-delimiting program $p$ via a constant-size wrapper that produces the world output string~$x$ fed to the regulator. We analyze regulation from the viewpoint of the algorithmic complexity of the output, $K(x)$. We define $R$ to be a \emph{good algorithmic regulator} if it \emph{reduces} the algorithmic complexity of the readout relative to a null (unregulated) baseline $\varnothing$, i.e., \[ \Delta = K\big(O_{W,\varnothing}\big) - K\big(O_{W,R}\big) &gt; 0. \] We then prove that the larger $\Delta$ is, the more world-regulator pairs with high mutual algorithmic information are favored. More precisely, a complexity gap $\Delta &gt; 0$ yields \[ \Pr\big((W,R)\mid x\big) \le C\,2^{\,M(W{:}R)}\,2^{-\Delta}, \] making low $M(W{:}R)$ exponentially unlikely as $\Delta$ grows. This is an AIT version of the idea that ``the regulator contains a model of the world.'' The framework is distribution-free, applies to individual sequences, and complements the Internal Model Principle. Beyond this necessity claim, the same coding-theorem calculus singles out a \emph{canonical scalar objective} and implicates a \emph{planner}. On the realized episode, a regulator behaves \emph{as if} it minimized the conditional description length of the readout.</description>

      <title>Towards Safe Maneuvering of Double-Ackermann-Steering Robots with a Soft Actor-Critic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a deep reinforcement learning framework based on Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) for safe and precise maneuvering of double-Ackermann-steering mobile robots (DASMRs). Unlike holonomic or simpler non-holonomic robots such as differential-drive robots, DASMRs face strong kinematic constraints that make classical planners brittle in cluttered environments. Our framework leverages the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and the CrossQ overlay to encourage maneuvering efficiency while avoiding obstacles. Simulation results with a heavy four-wheel-steering rover show that the learned policy can robustly reach up to 97% of target positions while avoiding obstacles. Our framework does not rely on handcrafted trajectories or expert demonstrations.</description>

      <title>AGENTIQL: An Agent-Inspired Multi-Expert Framework for Text-to-SQL Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs have advanced text-to-SQL generation, yet monolithic architectures struggle with complex reasoning and schema diversity. We propose AGENTIQL, an agent-inspired multi-expert framework that combines a reasoning agent for question decomposition, a coding agent for sub-query generation, and a refinement step for column selection. An adaptive router further balances efficiency and accuracy by selecting between our modular pipeline and a baseline parser. Several steps in the pipeline can be executed in parallel, making the framework scalable to larger workloads. Evaluated on the Spider benchmark, AGENTIQL improves execution accuracy and interpretability and achieves up to 86.07% EX with 14B models using the Planner&amp;Executor merging strategy. The attained performance is contingent upon the efficacy of the routing mechanism, thereby narrowing the gap to GPT-4-based SOTA (89.65% EX) while using much smaller open-source LLMs. Beyond accuracy, AGENTIQL enhances transparency by exposing intermediate reasoning steps, offering a robust, scalable, and interpretable approach to semantic parsing.</description>

      <title>BrowserAgent: Building Web Agents with Human-Inspired Web Browsing Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently solving real-world problems with LLMs increasingly hinges on their ability to interact with dynamic web environments and autonomously acquire external information. While recent research like Search-R1 and WebDancer demonstrates strong performance in solving web tasks, they heavily rely on additional tools to convert the interactive web environment into static text content. This is in contrast to human browsing behaviors, which involve diverse interactions with the browser, such as scrolling, clicking, and typing. In this paper, we propose BrowserAgent, a more interactive agent that solves complex tasks through human-inspired browser actions. BrowserAgent operates directly on raw web pages via Playwright through a set of predefined browser actions. We adopt a two-stage training (Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT)) to improve the model's generalization abilities. Despite using significantly less training data than Search-R1, BrowserAgent achieves more competitive results across different Open-QA tasks. Additionally, we introduce an explicit memory mechanism to store key conclusions across steps, further enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities for long-horizon tasks. Notably, BrowserAgent-7B can achieve around 20\% improvement over Search-R1 on multi-hop QA tasks like HotpotQA, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle. These results indicate that BrowserAgent can serve as a more advanced framework for more interactive and scalable web agents.</description>

      <title>Optimally Deep Networks -- Adapting Model Depth to Datasets for Superior Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical. To address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which provide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which begins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the given datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and inference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.</description>

      <title>ParsVoice: A Large-Scale Multi-Speaker Persian Speech Corpus for Text-to-Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing Persian speech datasets are typically smaller than their English counterparts, which creates a key limitation for developing Persian speech technologies. We address this gap by introducing ParsVoice, the largest Persian speech corpus designed specifically for text-to-speech(TTS) applications. We created an automated pipeline that transforms raw audiobook content into TTS-ready data, incorporating components such as a BERT-based sentence completion detector, a binary search boundary optimization method for precise audio-text alignment, and audio-text quality assessment frameworks tailored to Persian. The pipeline processes 2,000 audiobooks, yielding 3,526 hours of clean speech, which was further filtered into a 1,804-hour high-quality subset suitable for TTS, featuring more than 470 speakers. To validate the dataset, we fine-tuned XTTS for Persian, achieving a naturalness Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 3.6/5 and a Speaker Similarity Mean Opinion Score (SMOS) of 4.0/5 demonstrating ParsVoice's effectiveness for training multi-speaker TTS systems. ParsVoice is the largest high-quality Persian speech dataset, offering speaker diversity and audio quality comparable to major English corpora. The complete dataset has been made publicly available to accelerate the development of Persian speech technologies. The ParsVoice dataset is publicly available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/ParsVoice.</description>

      <title>AndesVL Technical Report: An Efficient Mobile-side Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, while cloud-based MLLMs such as QwenVL, InternVL, GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude Sonnet have demonstrated outstanding performance with enormous model sizes reaching hundreds of billions of parameters, they significantly surpass the limitations in memory, power consumption, and computing capacity of edge devices such as mobile phones. This paper introduces AndesVL, a suite of mobile-side MLLMs with 0.6B to 4B parameters based on Qwen3's LLM and various visual encoders. We comprehensively outline the model architectures, training pipeline, and training data of AndesVL, which achieves first-tier performance across a wide range of open-source benchmarks, including fields such as text-rich image understanding, reasoning and math, multi-image comprehension, general VQA, hallucination mitigation, multilingual understanding, and GUI-related tasks when compared with state-of-the-art models of a similar scale. Furthermore, we introduce a 1+N LoRA architecture alongside a Quantization-Aware LoRA Fine-Tuning (QALFT) framework to facilitate efficient task adaptation and model compression during mobile-side deployment of AndesVL. Moreover, utilizing our cache eviction algorithm -- OKV -- along with customized speculative decoding and compression strategies, we achieve a 6.7x peak decoding speedup ratio, up to 30.9% memory reduction, and 1.8 bits-per-weight when deploying AndesVL-4B on MediaTek Dimensity 9500 chips. We release all models on https://huggingface.co/OPPOer.</description>

      <title>ManiAgent: An Agentic Framework for General Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in robotic manipulation, their performance in complex reasoning and long-horizon task planning is limited by data scarcity and model capacity. To address this, we introduce ManiAgent, an agentic architecture for general manipulation tasks that achieves end-to-end output from task descriptions and environmental inputs to robotic manipulation actions. In this framework, multiple agents involve inter-agent communication to perform environmental perception, sub-task decomposition and action generation, enabling efficient handling of complex manipulation scenarios. Evaluations show ManiAgent achieves an 86.8% success rate on the SimplerEnv benchmark and 95.8% on real-world pick-and-place tasks, enabling efficient data collection that yields VLA models with performance comparable to those trained on human-annotated datasets. The project webpage is available at https://yi-yang929.github.io/ManiAgent/.</description>

      <title>Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization for Memory-efficient RL of Diffusion Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large language models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood functions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating corresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we propose \emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance. Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks. Our codes and models are available at \href{https://github.com/THU-KEG/BGPO}{https://github.com/THU-KEG/BGPO}.</description>
