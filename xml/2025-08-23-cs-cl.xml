      <title>Efficient Switchable Safety Control in LLMs via Magic-Token-Guided Co-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained, post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably, each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction, or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals. This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Ranking of WMT25 General Machine Translation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the preliminary ranking of the WMT25 General Machine Translation Shared Task, in which MT systems have been evaluated using automatic metrics. As this ranking is based on automatic evaluations, it may be biased in favor of systems that employ re-ranking techniques, such as Quality Estimation re-ranking or Minimum Bayes Risk decoding. The official WMT25 ranking will be based on human evaluation, which is more reliable and will supersede the automatic ranking.
  The purpose of this report is not to present the final findings of the General MT task, but rather to share preliminary results with task participants, which may be useful when preparing their system submission papers.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Culture Gap: A Framework for LLM-Driven Socio-Cultural Localization of Math Word Problems in Low-Resource Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However, multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names, organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence, truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native entities are introduced across various languages.</description>

      <title>Improving LLMs for Machine Translation Using Synthetic Preference Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems. In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting errors.</description>

      <title>Multilingual Datasets for Custom Input Extraction and Explanation Requests Parsing in Conversational XAI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations. Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method. While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users' underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL. We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass, employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.</description>

      <title>Reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling Is An Efficient Test-Time Weak-to-Strong Aligner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>LongRecall: A Structured Approach for Robust Recall Evaluation in Long-Form Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts, successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks. This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Course for Prompt-based Structured Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Nemotron-CC-Math: A 133 Billion-Token-Scale High Quality Math Pretraining Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities. However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel, domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats (e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate, standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+ (133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably, Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to +12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines, while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our code and datasets.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Answering Questions with False Assumptions: An Interpretable Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains. We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations. Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the false assumptions.</description>

      <title>ContextualLVLM-Agent: A Holistic Framework for Multi-Turn Visually-Grounded Dialogue and Complex Instruction Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions, leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth. Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction following capabilities through an iterative "memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance, attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro (3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth, instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.</description>

      <title>SemToken: Semantic-Aware Tokenization for Efficient Long-Context Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work, we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens. Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density, allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods. Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103 and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large language models.</description>

      <title>Fin-PRM: A Domain-Specialized Process Reward Model for Financial Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM}, a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i) selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time. Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning.

      <title>SparK: Query-Aware Unstructured Sparsity with Recoverable KV Cache Channel Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis), thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques, making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration. By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.

      <title>Select to Know: An Internal-External Knowledge Self-Selection Framework for Domain-Specific Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts, then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know (S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal, and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.</description>

      <title>Self-Guided Function Calling in Large Language Models via Stepwise Experience Recall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Are Checklists Really Useful for Automatic Evaluation of Generative Tasks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively, generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available at~https://github.com/momo0817/checklist-effectiveness-study</description>

      <title>VocabTailor: Dynamic Vocabulary Selection for Downstream Tasks in Small Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid, one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle, the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static vocabulary pruning.</description>

      <title>WangchanThaiInstruct: An instruction-following Dataset for Culture-Aware, Multitask, and Multi-domain Evaluation in Thai</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers, WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.</description>

      <title>UniCoM: A Universal Code-Switching Speech Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual systems.</description>

      <title>EMNLP: Educator-role Moral and Normative Large Language Models Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88 teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations. Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection, revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors. This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at https://e-m-n-l-p.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Conflict-Aware Soft Prompting for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation (CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.</description>

      <title>TComQA: Extracting Temporal Commonsense from Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text. Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of temporal question answering task.</description>

      <title>CUPE: Contextless Universal Phoneme Encoder for Language-Agnostic Speech Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length windows.</description>

      <title>KG-EDAS: A Meta-Metric Framework for Evaluating Knowledge Graph Completion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements. Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank (MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset, different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories: general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning; domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination, unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design paradigm for future benchmark innovation.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Trust in Multimodal Large Language Models: Evaluation, Analysis, and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities. Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and 28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>Confidence-Modulated Speculative Decoding for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled, plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under varying conditions of uncertainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text, formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as "lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple, principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.</description>

      <title>Attribution, Citation, and Quotation: A Survey of Evidence-based Text Generation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate 300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges and outline promising directions for future work.</description>

      <title>When Audio and Text Disagree: Revealing Text Bias in Large Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon: when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling conflicting multi-modal inputs.

      <title>LLaSO: A Foundational Framework for Reproducible Research in Large Language and Speech Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open, end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong, reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models, LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset, pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.</description>

      <title>A Study of Privacy-preserving Language Modeling Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in language modeling have increased their use in various applications and domains. Language models, often trained on sensitive data, can memorize and disclose this information during privacy attacks, raising concerns about protecting individuals' privacy rights. Preserving privacy in language models has become a crucial area of research, as privacy is one of the fundamental human rights. Despite its significance, understanding of how much privacy risk these language models possess and how it can be mitigated is still limited. This research addresses this by providing a comprehensive study of the privacy-preserving language modeling approaches. This study gives an in-depth overview of these approaches, highlights their strengths, and investigates their limitations. The outcomes of this study contribute to the ongoing research on privacy-preserving language modeling, providing valuable insights and outlining future research directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mental health disorders are a global crisis. While various datasets exist for detecting such disorders, there remains a critical gap in identifying individuals actively seeking help. This paper introduces a novel dataset, M-Help, specifically designed to detect help-seeking behavior on social media. The dataset goes beyond traditional labels by identifying not only help-seeking activity but also specific mental health disorders and their underlying causes, such as relationship challenges or financial stressors. AI models trained on M-Help can address three key tasks: identifying help-seekers, diagnosing mental health conditions, and uncovering the root causes of issues.</description>

      <title>Principle Methods of Rendering Non-equivalent Words from Uzbek and Dari to Russian and English</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words because there are different local and internal words like food, garment, cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the target language and this research has been completed using library-based research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar &amp; Uzbek into English and Russian languages.</description>

      <title>PyTOD: Programmable Task-Oriented Dialogue with Execution Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach, using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses, demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.</description>

      <title>RadReason: Radiology Report Evaluation Metric with Reasons and Sub-Scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1) Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment. Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment. Code will be released upon publication.</description>

      <title>SLM4Offer: Personalized Marketing Offer Generation Using Contrastive Learning Based Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction. Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation, developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model, specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives in advancing personalized marketing.</description>

      <title>Subjective Behaviors and Preferences in LLM: Language of Browsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks, purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences. We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language", albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask: (i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM? (ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences? (iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved alignment.</description>

      <title>Influence-driven Curriculum Learning for Pre-training on Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training. Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their \textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10 percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric notion of difficulty is adopted.</description>

      <title>SLM-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark of Small Language Models on Environmental Impacts -- Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency and accessibility, yet a systematic evaluation of their performance and environmental impact remains lacking. We introduce SLM-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess SLMs across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, computational efficiency, and sustainability metrics. SLM-Bench evaluates 15 SLMs on 9 NLP tasks using 23 datasets spanning 14 domains. The evaluation is conducted on 4 hardware configurations, providing a rigorous comparison of their effectiveness. Unlike prior benchmarks, SLM-Bench quantifies 11 metrics across correctness, computation, and consumption, enabling a holistic assessment of efficiency trade-offs. Our evaluation considers controlled hardware conditions, ensuring fair comparisons across models. We develop an open-source benchmarking pipeline with standardized evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency and real-world applicability.</description>

      <title>HebID: Detecting Social Identities in Hebrew-language Political Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts (Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities (e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results (macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in other non-English political contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially, Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct to facilitate further research in diffusion-based language modeling.</description>

Abstract: We present the first large-scale computational study of political delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches (1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which 1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for understanding democratic discourse.</description>

      <title>SafetyFlow: An Agent-Flow System for Automated LLM Safety Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However, existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains 23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in text generation; however, these creative elements require heavy computation and are accompanied by a steep cost. Especially for targeted applications such as sales and marketing outreach, these costs are far from feasible. This paper introduces the concept of "Trained Miniatures" - Small Language Models(SLMs) fine-tuned for specific, high-value applications, generating similar domain-specific responses for a fraction of the cost.</description>

      <title>SDGO: Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization for Consistent Safety in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks. By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Computer Science Survey Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols. To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions: information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE</description>

      <title>Position Bias Mitigates Position Bias:Mitigate Position Bias Through Inter-Position Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones, thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself. We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and \textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior performance on their respective tasks.</description>

      <title>Stemming -- The Evolution and Current State with a Focus on Bangla</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider. This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and processing.</description>

      <title>EcomMMMU: Strategic Utilization of Visuals for Robust Multimodal E-Commerce Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question: do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images. EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8 essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content. Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks. Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through https://anonymous.4open.science/r/submission25.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Agentic RAG System Training for Traceable Diagnostic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help, but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure, and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses.

      <title>Dissecting Tool-Integrated Reasoning: An Empirical Study and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost (PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tool calling has emerged as a critical capability for AI agents to interact with the real world and solve complex tasks. While the Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is a significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve multi-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review, that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world agent capabilities, advancing toward autonomous AI systems that reliably execute complex tasks through tool use.</description>

      <title>A Chinese Heart Failure Status Speech Database with Universal and Personalised Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech is a cost-effective and non-intrusive data source for identifying acute and chronic heart failure (HF). However, there is a lack of research on whether Chinese syllables contain HF-related information, as observed in other well-studied languages. This study presents the first Chinese speech database of HF patients, featuring paired recordings taken before and after hospitalisation. The findings confirm the effectiveness of the Chinese language in HF detection using both standard 'patient-wise' and personalised 'pair-wise' classification approaches, with the latter serving as an ideal speaker-decoupled baseline for future research. Statistical tests and classification results highlight individual differences as key contributors to inaccuracy. Additionally, an adaptive frequency filter (AFF) is proposed for frequency importance analysis. The data and demonstrations are published at https://github.com/panyue1998/Voice_HF.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents the architecture and performance of a novel Multilingual Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system developed by the Transsion Speech Team for Track 1 of the MLC-SLM 2025 Challenge. The proposed system comprises three key components: 1) a frozen Whisper-large-v3 based speech encoder, leveraging large-scale pretraining to ensure robust acoustic feature extraction; 2) a trainable adaptor module using Linear-ReLU-Linear transformation mechanisms to effectively align speech and text representations; and 3) a frozen Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct large language model (LLM) integrated with trainable LoRA for optimized contextual linguistic decoding. By systematically combining pretrained models with task specific fine-tuning, the system achieved a word/character error rate (WER/CER) of 9.83% across 11 languages in the evaluation set and ranked third place among global participants.</description>

      <title>Robust Symbolic Reasoning for Visual Narratives via Hierarchical and Semantically Normalized Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding visual narratives such as comics requires structured representations that capture events, characters, and their relations across multiple levels of story organization. However, symbolic narrative graphs often suffer from inconsistency and redundancy, where similar actions or events are labeled differently across annotations or contexts. Such variance limits the effectiveness of reasoning and generalization.
  This paper introduces a semantic normalization framework for hierarchical narrative knowledge graphs. Building on cognitively grounded models of narrative comprehension, we propose methods that consolidate semantically related actions and events using lexical similarity and embedding-based clustering. The normalization process reduces annotation noise, aligns symbolic categories across narrative levels, and preserves interpretability.
  We demonstrate the framework on annotated manga stories from the Manga109 dataset, applying normalization to panel-, event-, and story-level graphs. Preliminary evaluations across narrative reasoning tasks, such as action retrieval, character grounding, and event summarization, show that semantic normalization improves coherence and robustness, while maintaining symbolic transparency. These findings suggest that normalization is a key step toward scalable, cognitively inspired graph models for multimodal narrative understanding.</description>

      <title>Don't Think Twice! Over-Reasoning Impairs Confidence Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence, increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we highlight the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI, in the insurance sector. We consider and emphasize the unique opportunities, challenges, and potential pathways in insurance amid rapid performance improvements, increased open-source access, decreasing deployment costs, and the complexity of LLM or agentic AI frameworks. To bring it closer to home, we identify critical gaps in the African insurance market and highlight key local efforts, players, and partnership opportunities. Finally, we call upon actuaries, insurers, regulators, and tech leaders to a collaborative effort aimed at creating inclusive, sustainable, and equitable AI strategies and solutions: by and for Africans.</description>

      <title>Open-Universe Assistance Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting, we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by both LLM-based and human evaluations.</description>

      <title>aiXiv: A Next-Generation Open Access Ecosystem for Scientific Discovery Generated by AI Scientists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers, and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem. Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content; existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted, reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

      <title>LLM4Sweat: A Trustworthy Large Language Model for Hyperhidrosis Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder, affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis, personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support. In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with similar data and trustworthiness challenges.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Review Generation for Poisoning Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that recommender systems (RSs) are highly vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious actors inject fake user profiles, including a group of well-designed fake ratings, to manipulate recommendations. Due to security and privacy constraints in practice, attackers typically possess limited knowledge of the victim system and thus need to craft profiles that have transferability across black-box RSs. To maximize the attack impact, the profiles often remains imperceptible. However, generating such high-quality profiles with the restricted resources is challenging. Some works suggest incorporating fake textual reviews to strengthen the profiles; yet, the poor quality of the reviews largely undermines the attack effectiveness and imperceptibility under the practical setting.
  To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose to enhance the quality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of multimodal foundation models. To this end, we introduce a demonstration retrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the navie ICL. Specifically, we propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to generate high-quality fake user profiles, which can gain insights into the robustness of RSs. The profiles are generated by a jailbreaker and collaboratively optimized on an instructional agent and a guardian to improve the attack transferability and imperceptibility. Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAN achieves the state-of-the-art poisoning attack performance.</description>

      <title>AmbiSQL: Interactive Ambiguity Detection and Resolution for Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into SQL queries, providing substantial value for non-expert users. While large language models (LLMs) show promising results for this task, they remain error-prone. Query ambiguity has been recognized as a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL systems, leading to misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL generation. We demonstrate AmbiSQL, an interactive system that automatically detects query ambiguities and guides users through intuitive multiple-choice questions to clarify their intent. Our approach introduces a fine-grained ambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities that affect database element mapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous questions. Evaluation on an ambiguous query dataset shows that AmbiSQL achieves 87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by 50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems. Our demonstration showcases the significant performance gains and highlights the system's practical usability. Code repo and demonstration are available at: https://github.com/JustinzjDing/AmbiSQL.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Attacks against Neural Ranking Models via In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While neural ranking models (NRMs) have shown high effectiveness, they remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we introduce Few-Shot Adversarial Prompting (FSAP), a novel black-box attack framework that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate high-ranking adversarial documents. Unlike previous approaches that rely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents, FSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting, requiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning the LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP synthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly embed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic content. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful examples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which enables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across unrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health Misinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate documents. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that these adversarial outputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability, posing a realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also effectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Knowledge Graph Complexity via Semantic, Spectral, and Structural Metrics for Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree, Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.</description>

      <title>Multiple Memory Systems for Enhancing the Long-term Memory of Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results, but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments, with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase, MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its practical value.</description>

      <title>IPIGuard: A Novel Tool Dependency Graph-Based Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection in LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are widely deployed in real-world applications, where they leverage tools to retrieve and manipulate external data for complex tasks. However, when interacting with untrusted data sources (e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain injected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to malicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI). Existing defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary detection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness, they fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security, which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents still retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable to stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the model. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel defensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents' task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph (TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external data, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by injected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks. Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>DiagECG: An LLM-Driven Framework for Diagnostic Reasoning via Discretized ECG Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task, enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model, DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.</description>

      <title>CITE: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Heterogeneous Text-Attributed Graphs on Catalytic Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck, hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials. CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across diverse modeling paradigms.</description>

      <title>Foundational Design Principles and Patterns for Building Robust and Adaptive GenAI-Native Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology, demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse application domains. However, GenAI faces several major challenges in developing reliable and efficient GenAI-empowered systems due to its unpredictability and inefficiency. This paper advocates for a paradigm shift: future GenAI-native systems should integrate GenAI's cognitive capabilities with traditional software engineering principles to create robust, adaptive, and efficient systems.
  We introduce foundational GenAI-native design principles centered around five key pillars -- reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and assurance -- and propose architectural patterns such as GenAI-native cells, organic substrates, and programmable routers to guide the creation of resilient and self-evolving systems. Additionally, we outline the key ingredients of a GenAI-native software stack and discuss the impact of these systems from technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives, underscoring the need for further validation and experimentation. Our work aims to inspire future research and encourage relevant communities to implement and refine this conceptual framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) is critically dependent on the availability of high-quality datasets for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work, we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored for these training paradigms. Our approach employs a modular and configuration-based pipeline capable of modeling complex dialogue flows with minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT and DPO use cases, enabling seamless integration into diverse training workflows. Together, these innovations offer a robust solution for generating and managing synthetic conversational data at scale, significantly reducing the overhead of data preparation in LLM training pipelines.</description>

      <title>Classification errors distort findings in automated speech processing: examples and solutions from child-development research</title>

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language experience and the association between children's production and their input. In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%, potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.</description>

      <title>Language-Guided Tuning: Enhancing Numeric Optimization with Textual Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning, requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy, feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods, achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.</description>

      <title>Intern-S1: A Scientific Multimodal Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged, achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters, continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic stabilities for crystals.

      <title>Unplug and Play Language Models: Decomposing Experts in Language Models at Inference Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enabled by large-scale text corpora with huge parameters, pre-trained language models operate as multi-task experts using a single model architecture. However, recent studies have revealed that certain neurons play disproportionately important roles in solving specific tasks, suggesting that task-relevant substructures can be isolated and selectively activated for each task. Therefore, we introduce Decomposition of Experts (DoE), a novel framework that dynamically identifies and activates task-specific experts within a language model to reduce inference cost without sacrificing accuracy. We first define a task expert as a set of parameters that significantly influence the performance of a specific task and propose a four-step unplug-and-play process: (1) receiving a user request, (2) identifying the corresponding task expert, (3) performing inference using the expert-localized model, and (4) restoring the original model and waiting for the next task. Using attribution methods and prompt tuning, DoE isolates task-relevant neurons, minimizing computational overhead while maintaining task performance. We assume a setting where a language model receives user requests from five widely used natural language understanding benchmarks, processing one task at a time. In this setup, we demonstrate that DoE achieves up to a x1.73 inference speed-up with a 65% pruning rate, without compromising accuracy. Comparisons with various task expert localization methods reveal that DoE effectively identifies task experts, while ablation studies validate the importance of its components. Additionally, we analyze the effects of batch size, token count, and layer types on inference speed-up, providing practical insights for adopting DoE. The proposed framework is both practical and scalable, applicable to any transformer-based architecture, offering a robust solution for efficient task-specific inference.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Entity and Event Level Conceptualization in Generalizable Reasoning: A Survey of Tasks, Methods, Applications, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conceptualization, a fundamental element of human cognition, plays a pivotal role in human generalizable reasoning. Generally speaking, it refers to the process of sequentially abstracting specific instances into higher-level concepts and then forming abstract knowledge that can be applied in unfamiliar or novel situations. This enhances models' inferential capabilities and supports the effective transfer of knowledge across various domains. Despite its significance, the broad nature of this term has led to inconsistencies in understanding conceptualization across various works, as there exists different types of instances that can be abstracted in a wide variety of ways. There is also a lack of a systematic overview that comprehensively examines existing works on the definition, execution, and application of conceptualization to enhance reasoning tasks. In this paper, we address these gaps by first proposing a categorization of different types of conceptualizations into four levels based on the types of instances being conceptualized, in order to clarify the term and define the scope of our work. Then, we present the first comprehensive survey of over 150 papers, surveying various definitions, resources, methods, and downstream applications related to conceptualization into a unified taxonomy, with a focus on the entity and event levels. Furthermore, we shed light on potential future directions in this field and hope to garner more attention from the community.</description>

Abstract: We present two multilingual LLMs, Teuken 7B-base and Teuken 7B-instruct, designed to embrace Europe's linguistic diversity by supporting all 24 official languages of the European Union. Trained on a dataset comprising around 60% non-English data and utilizing a custom multilingual tokenizer, our models address the limitations of existing LLMs that predominantly focus on English or a few high-resource languages. We detail the models' development principles, i.e., data composition, tokenizer optimization, and training methodologies. The models demonstrate strong performance across multilingual benchmarks, as evidenced by their performance on European versions of ARC, HellaSwag, and TruthfulQA.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning foundational models to code diagnoses from veterinary health records</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Veterinary medical records represent a large data resource for application to veterinary and One Health clinical research efforts. Use of the data is limited by interoperability challenges including inconsistent data formats and data siloing. Clinical coding using standardized medical terminologies enhances the quality of medical records and facilitates their interoperability with veterinary and human health records from other sites. Previous studies, such as DeepTag and VetTag, evaluated the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate veterinary diagnosis coding, employing long short-term memory (LSTM) and transformer models to infer a subset of Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) diagnosis codes from free-text clinical notes. This study expands on these efforts by incorporating all 7,739 distinct SNOMED-CT diagnosis codes recognized by the Colorado State University (CSU) Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) and by leveraging the increasing availability of pre-trained language models (LMs). 13 freely-available pre-trained LMs were fine-tuned on the free-text notes from 246,473 manually-coded veterinary patient visits included in the CSU VTH's electronic health records (EHRs), which resulted in superior performance relative to previous efforts. The most accurate results were obtained when expansive labeled data were used to fine-tune relatively large clinical LMs, but the study also showed that comparable results can be obtained using more limited resources and non-clinical LMs. The results of this study contribute to the improvement of the quality of veterinary EHRs by investigating accessible methods for automated coding and support both animal and human health research by paving the way for more integrated and comprehensive health databases that span species and institutions.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Automated Literature Review: An Evaluation of Reference Generation, Abstract Writing, and Review Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13612v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a potential solution to automate the complex processes involved in writing literature reviews, such as literature collection, organization, and summarization. However, it is yet unclear how good LLMs are at automating comprehensive and reliable literature reviews. This study introduces a framework to automatically evaluate the performance of LLMs in three key tasks of literature writing: reference generation, literature summary, and literature review composition. We introduce multidimensional evaluation metrics that assess the hallucination rates in generated references and measure the semantic coverage and factual consistency of the literature summaries and compositions against human-written counterparts. The experimental results reveal that even the most advanced models still generate hallucinated references, despite recent progress. Moreover, we observe that the performance of different models varies across disciplines when it comes to writing literature reviews. These findings highlight the need for further research and development to improve the reliability of LLMs in automating academic literature reviews.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Addressing in Language Models via Contexualized Equivariant Positional Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers rely on both content-based and position-based addressing mechanisms to make predictions, but existing positional encoding techniques often diminish the effectiveness of position-based addressing. Many current methods enforce rigid patterns in attention maps, limiting the ability to model long-range dependencies and adapt to diverse tasks. Additionally, most positional encodings are learned as general biases, lacking the specialization required for different instances within a dataset. To address this, we propose con\textbf{T}extualized equivari\textbf{A}nt \textbf{P}osition \textbf{E}ncoding (\textbf{TAPE}), a novel framework that enhances positional embeddings by incorporating sequence content across layers. TAPE introduces dynamic, context-aware positional encodings, overcoming the constraints of traditional fixed patterns. We show that TAPE can provably facilitate LLM reasoning ability by emulating a broader class of algorithms. By enforcing permutation and orthogonal equivariance, TAPE ensures the stability of positional encodings during updates, improving long-context ability. Our method can be easily integrated into pre-trained transformers, offering parameter-efficient fine-tuning with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments show that TAPE achieves superior performance in language modeling, arithmetic reasoning, and long-context retrieval tasks compared to existing positional embedding techniques. Code is available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/TAPE.</description>

      <title>Everybody Likes to Sleep: A Computer-Assisted Comparison of Object Naming Data from 30 Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Object naming - the act of identifying an object with a word or a phrase - is a fundamental skill in interpersonal communication, relevant to many disciplines, such as psycholinguistics, cognitive linguistics, or language and vision research. Object naming datasets, which consist of concept lists with picture pairings, are used to gain insights into how humans access and select names for objects in their surroundings and to study the cognitive processes involved in converting visual stimuli into semantic concepts. Unfortunately, object naming datasets often lack transparency and have a highly idiosyncratic structure. Our study tries to make current object naming data transparent and comparable by using a multilingual, computer-assisted approach that links individual items of object naming lists to unified concepts. Our current sample links 17 object naming datasets that cover 30 languages from 10 different language families. We illustrate how the comparative dataset can be explored by searching for concepts that recur across the majority of datasets and comparing the conceptual spaces of covered object naming datasets with classical basic vocabulary lists from historical linguistics and linguistic typology. Our findings can serve as a basis for enhancing cross-linguistic object naming research and as a guideline for future studies dealing with object naming tasks.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Prompt Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Well-designed prompts are crucial for enhancing Large language models' (LLMs) reasoning capabilities while aligning their outputs with task requirements across diverse domains. However, manually designed prompts require expertise and iterative experimentation. While existing prompt optimization methods aim to automate this process, they rely heavily on external references such as ground truth or by humans, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where such data is unavailable or costly to obtain. To address this, we propose Self-Supervised Prompt Optimization (SPO), a cost-efficient framework that discovers effective prompts for both closed and open-ended tasks without requiring external reference. Motivated by the observations that prompt quality manifests directly in LLM outputs and LLMs can effectively assess adherence to task requirements, we derive evaluation and optimization signals purely from output comparisons. Specifically, SPO selects superior prompts through pairwise output comparisons evaluated by an LLM evaluator, followed by an LLM optimizer that aligns outputs with task requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPO outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods, achieving comparable or superior results with significantly lower costs (e.g., 1.1% to 5.6% of existing methods) and fewer samples (e.g., three samples). The code is available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/SPO.</description>

      <title>RefineCoder: Iterative Improving of Large Language Models via Adaptive Critique Refinement for Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Code generation has attracted increasing attention with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs). Many studies have developed powerful code LLMs by synthesizing code-related instruction data and applying supervised fine-tuning. However, these methods are limited by teacher model distillation and ignore the potential of iterative refinement by self-generated code. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Critique Refinement (ACR), which enables the model to refine itself by self-generated code and external critique, rather than directly imitating the code responses of the teacher model. Concretely, ACR includes a composite scoring system with LLM-as-a-Judge to evaluate the quality of code responses and a selective critique strategy with LLM-as-a-Critic to critique self-generated low-quality code responses. We develop the RefineCoder series by iteratively applying ACR, achieving continuous performance improvement on multiple code generation benchmarks. Compared to the baselines of the same size, our proposed RefineCoder series can achieve comparable or even superior performance using less data.</description>

      <title>Ontology-Guided Reverse Thinking Makes Large Language Models Stronger on Knowledge Graph Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing. However, in knowledge graph question answering tasks (KGQA), there remains the issue of answering questions that require multi-hop reasoning. Existing methods rely on entity vector matching, but the purpose of the question is abstract and difficult to match with specific entities. As a result, it is difficult to establish reasoning paths to the purpose, which leads to information loss and redundancy. To address this issue, inspired by human reverse thinking, we propose Ontology-Guided Reverse Thinking (ORT), a novel framework that constructs reasoning paths from purposes back to conditions. ORT operates in three key phases: (1) using LLM to extract purpose labels and condition labels, (2) constructing label reasoning paths based on the KG ontology, and (3) using the label reasoning paths to guide knowledge retrieval. Experiments on the WebQSP and CWQ datasets show that ORT achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly enhances the capability of LLMs for KGQA.</description>

      <title>Pub-Guard-LLM: Detecting Retracted Biomedical Articles with Reliable Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15429v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A significant and growing number of published scientific articles is found to involve fraudulent practices, posing a serious threat to the credibility and safety of research in fields such as medicine. We propose Pub-Guard-LLM, the first large language model-based system tailored to fraud detection of biomedical scientific articles. We provide three application modes for deploying Pub-Guard-LLM: vanilla reasoning, retrieval-augmented generation, and multi-agent debate. Each mode allows for textual explanations of predictions. To assess the performance of our system, we introduce an open-source benchmark, PubMed Retraction, comprising over 11K real-world biomedical articles, including metadata and retraction labels. We show that, across all modes, Pub-Guard-LLM consistently surpasses the performance of various baselines and provides more reliable explanations, namely explanations which are deemed more relevant and coherent than those generated by the baselines when evaluated by multiple assessment methods. By enhancing both detection performance and explainability in scientific fraud detection, Pub-Guard-LLM contributes to safeguarding research integrity with a novel, effective, open-source tool.</description>

      <title>Robust Bias Detection in MLMs and its Application to Human Trait Ratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been significant prior work using templates to study bias against demographic attributes in MLMs. However, these have limitations: they overlook random variability of templates and target concepts analyzed, assume equality amongst templates, and overlook bias quantification. Addressing these, we propose a systematic statistical approach to assess bias in MLMs, using mixed models to account for random effects, pseudo-perplexity weights for sentences derived from templates and quantify bias using statistical effect sizes. Replicating prior studies, we match on bias scores in magnitude and direction with small to medium effect sizes. Next, we explore the novel problem of gender bias in the context of $\emph{personality}$ and $\textit{character}$ traits, across seven MLMs (base and large). We find that MLMs vary; ALBERT is unbiased for binary gender but the most biased for non-binary $\textit{neo}$, while RoBERTa-large is the most biased for binary gender but shows small to no bias for $\textit{neo}$. There is some alignment of MLM bias and findings in psychology (human perspective) - in $\textit{agreeableness}$ with RoBERTa-large and $\textit{emotional stability}$ with BERT-large. There is general agreement for the remaining 3 personality dimensions: both sides observe at most small differences across gender. For character traits, human studies on gender bias are limited thus comparisons are not feasible.</description>

      <title>Synthetic vs. Gold: The Role of LLM Generated Labels and Data in Cyberbullying Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyberbullying (CB) presents a pressing threat, especially to children, underscoring the urgent need for robust detection systems to ensure online safety. While large-scale datasets on online abuse exist, there remains a significant gap in labeled data that specifically reflects the language and communication styles used by children. The acquisition of such data from vulnerable populations, such as children, is challenging due to ethical, legal and technical barriers. Moreover, the creation of these datasets relies heavily on human annotation, which not only strains resources but also raises significant concerns due to annotators exposure to harmful content. In this paper, we address these challenges by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data and labels. Our experiments demonstrate that synthetic data enables BERT-based CB classifiers to achieve performance close to that of those trained on fully authentic datasets (75.8% vs. 81.5% accuracy). Additionally, LLMs can effectively label authentic yet unlabeled data, allowing BERT classifiers to attain a comparable performance level (79.1% vs. 81.5% accuracy). These results highlight the potential of LLMs as a scalable, ethical, and cost-effective solution for generating data for CB detection.</description>

      <title>Pragmatic Inference Chain (PIC) Improving LLMs' Reasoning of Authentic Implicit Toxic Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) gives rise to ethical concerns about their performance, while opening new avenues for developing toxic language detection techniques. However, LLMs' unethical output and their capability of detecting toxicity have primarily been tested on language data that do not demand complex meaning inference, such as the biased associations of 'he' with programmer and 'she' with household. Nowadays toxic language adopts a much more creative range of implicit forms, thanks to advanced censorship. In this study, we collect authentic toxic interactions that evade online censorship and that are verified by human annotators as inference-intensive. To evaluate and improve LLMs' reasoning of the authentic implicit toxic language, we propose a new prompting method, Pragmatic Inference Chain (PIC), drawn on interdisciplinary findings from cognitive science and linguistics. The PIC prompting significantly improves the success rate of GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, DeepSeek-v2.5, and DeepSeek-v3 in identifying implicit toxic language, compared to five baseline prompts, such as CoT and rule-based baselines. In addition, it also facilitates the models to produce more explicit and coherent reasoning processes, hence can potentially be generalized to other inference-intensive tasks, e.g., understanding humour and metaphors.</description>

      <title>Advancing the Database of Cross-Linguistic Colexifications with New Workflows and Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lexical resources are crucial for cross-linguistic analysis and can provide new insights into computational models for natural language learning. Here, we present an advanced database for comparative studies of words with multiple meanings, a phenomenon known as colexification. The new version includes improvements in the handling, selection and presentation of the data. We compare the new database with previous versions and find that our improvements provide a more balanced sample covering more language families worldwide, with enhanced data quality, given that all word forms are provided in phonetic transcription. We conclude that the new Database of Cross-Linguistic Colexifications has the potential to inspire exciting new studies that link cross-linguistic data to open questions in linguistic typology, historical linguistics, psycholinguistics, and computational linguistics.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Explainable Activity Recognition in Smart Homes: A Critical Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to uncover the inner reasoning of machine learning models. In IoT systems, XAI improves the transparency of models processing sensor data from multiple heterogeneous devices, ensuring end-users understand and trust their outputs. Among the many applications, XAI has also been applied to sensor-based Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) recognition in smart homes. Existing approaches highlight which sensor events are most important for each predicted activity, using simple rules to convert these events into natural language explanations for non-expert users. However, these methods produce rigid explanations lacking natural language flexibility and are not scalable. With the recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is worth exploring whether they can enhance explanation generation, considering their proven knowledge of human activities. This paper investigates potential approaches to combine XAI and LLMs for sensor-based ADL recognition. We evaluate if LLMs can be used: a) as explainable zero-shot ADL recognition models, avoiding costly labeled data collection, and b) to automate the generation of explanations for existing data-driven XAI approaches when training data is available and the goal is higher recognition rates. Our critical evaluation provides insights into the benefits and challenges of using LLMs for explainable ADL recognition.</description>

      <title>VerifiAgent: a Unified Verification Agent in Language Model Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities but often produce unreliable or incorrect responses. Existing verification methods are typically model-specific or domain-restricted, requiring significant computational resources and lacking scalability across diverse reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we propose VerifiAgent, a unified verification agent that integrates two levels of verification: meta-verification, which assesses completeness and consistency in model responses, and tool-based adaptive verification, where VerifiAgent autonomously selects appropriate verification tools based on the reasoning type, including mathematical, logical, or commonsense reasoning. This adaptive approach ensures both efficiency and robustness across different verification scenarios. Experimental results show that VerifiAgent outperforms baseline verification methods (e.g., deductive verifier, backward verifier) among all reasoning tasks. Additionally, it can further enhance reasoning accuracy by leveraging feedback from verification results. VerifiAgent can also be effectively applied to inference scaling, achieving better results with fewer generated samples and costs compared to existing process reward models in the mathematical reasoning domain.

      <title>MuSeD: A Multimodal Spanish Dataset for Sexism Detection in Social Media Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sexism is generally defined as prejudice and discrimination based on sex or gender, affecting every sector of society, from social institutions to relationships and individual behavior. Social media platforms amplify the impact of sexism by conveying discriminatory content not only through text but also across multiple modalities, highlighting the critical need for a multimodal approach to the analysis of sexism online. With the rise of social media platforms where users share short videos, sexism is increasingly spreading through video content. Automatically detecting sexism in videos is a challenging task, as it requires analyzing the combination of verbal, audio, and visual elements to identify sexist content. In this study, (1) we introduce MuSeD, a new Multimodal Spanish dataset for Sexism Detection consisting of $\approx$ 11 hours of videos extracted from TikTok and BitChute; (2) we propose an innovative annotation framework for analyzing the contributions of textual, vocal, and visual modalities to the classification of content as either sexist or non-sexist; and (3) we evaluate a range of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs on the task of sexism detection. We find that visual information plays a key role in labeling sexist content for both humans and models. Models effectively detect explicit sexism; however, they struggle with implicit cases, such as stereotypes, instances where annotators also show low agreement. This highlights the inherent difficulty of the task, as identifying implicit sexism depends on the social and cultural context.</description>

Abstract: Enhancing existing models with new knowledge is a crucial aspect of AI development. This paper introduces a novel method for integrating a new language into a large language model (LLM). Our approach successfully incorporates a previously unseen target language into an existing LLM without compromising its prior knowledge. We trained a tiny model with 1.5 billion parameters named Kuwain by injecting the Arabic language into a small open-source model mainly trained in English. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in Arabic language performance, with an average 8% improvement across various benchmarks, while retaining the model's existing knowledge with a minimum amount of the original model's data. This offers a cost-effective alternative to training a comprehensive model in both English and Arabic. The results highlight the potential for efficient, targeted language model expansion without extensive retraining or resource-intensive processes.</description>

      <title>Cequel: Cost-Effective Querying of Large Language Models for Text Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text clustering aims to automatically partition a collection of documents into coherent groups based on their linguistic features. In the literature, this task is formulated either as metric clustering over pre-trained text embeddings or as graph clustering based on pairwise similarities derived from an oracle, e.g., a large machine learning model. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved this field by providing high-quality contextualized embeddings and accurate semantic similarity estimates. However, leveraging LLMs at scale introduces substantial computational and financial costs due to the large number of required API queries or inference calls. To address this issue, we propose Cequel, a cost-effective framework that achieves accurate text clustering under a limited budget of LLM queries. At its core, Cequel constructs must-link and cannot-link constraints by selectively querying LLMs on informative text pairs or triplets, identified via our proposed algorithms, EdgeLLM and TriangleLLM. These constraints are then utilized in a weighted constrained clustering algorithm to form high-quality clusters. Specifically, EdgeLLM and TriangleLLM employ carefully designed greedy selection strategies and prompting techniques to identify and extract informative constraints efficiently. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Cequel consistently outperforms existing methods in unsupervised text clustering under the same query budget.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents the Annif system in SemEval-2025 Task 5 (LLMs4Subjects), which focussed on subject indexing using large language models (LLMs). The task required creating subject predictions for bibliographic records from the bilingual TIBKAT database using the GND subject vocabulary. Our approach combines traditional natural language processing and machine learning techniques implemented in the Annif toolkit with innovative LLM-based methods for translation and synthetic data generation, and merging predictions from monolingual models. The system ranked first in the all-subjects category and second in the tib-core-subjects category in the quantitative evaluation, and fourth in qualitative evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of combining traditional XMTC algorithms with modern LLM techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of subject indexing in multilingual contexts.</description>

      <title>WebEvolver: Enhancing Web Agent Self-Improvement with Coevolving World Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agent self-improvement, where the backbone Large Language Model (LLM) of the agent are trained on trajectories sampled autonomously based on their own policies, has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing performance. Recent advancements, particularly in web environments, face a critical limitation: their performance will reach a stagnation point during autonomous learning cycles, hindering further improvement. We argue that this stems from limited exploration of the web environment and insufficient exploitation of pre-trained web knowledge in LLMs. To improve the performance of self-improvement, we propose a novel framework that introduces a co-evolving World Model LLM. This world model predicts the next observation based on the current observation and action within the web environment. Leveraging LLMs' pretrained knowledge of abundant web content, the World Model serves dual roles: (1) as a virtual web server generating self-instructed training data to continuously refine the agent's policy, and (2) as an imagination engine during inference, enabling look-ahead simulation to guide action selection for the agent LLM. Experiments in real-world web environments (Mind2Web-Live, WebVoyager, and GAIA-web) show a 10% performance gain over existing self-evolving agents, demonstrating the efficacy and generalizability of our approach, without using any distillation from more powerful close-sourced models. Our work establishes the necessity of integrating world models into autonomous agent frameworks to unlock sustained adaptability.

      <title>Sadeed: Advancing Arabic Diacritization Through Small Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arabic text diacritization remains a persistent challenge in natural language processing due to the language's morphological richness. In this paper, we introduce Sadeed, a novel approach based on a fine-tuned decoder-only language model adapted from Kuwain 1.5B Hennara et al. [2025], a compact model originally trained on diverse Arabic corpora. Sadeed is fine-tuned on carefully curated, high-quality diacritized datasets, constructed through a rigorous data-cleaning and normalization pipeline. Despite utilizing modest computational resources, Sadeed achieves competitive results compared to proprietary large language models and outperforms traditional models trained on similar domains. Additionally, we highlight key limitations in current benchmarking practices for Arabic diacritization. To address these issues, we introduce SadeedDiac-25, a new benchmark designed to enable fairer and more comprehensive evaluation across diverse text genres and complexity levels. Together, Sadeed and SadeedDiac-25 provide a robust foundation for advancing Arabic NLP applications, including machine translation, text-to-speech, and language learning tools.</description>

Abstract: We introduce Mutarjim, a compact yet powerful language model for bidirectional Arabic-English translation. While large-scale LLMs have shown impressive progress in natural language processing tasks, including machine translation, smaller models. Leveraging this insight, we developed Mutarjim based on Kuwain-1.5B , a language model tailored for both Arabic and English. Despite its modest size, Mutarjim outperforms much larger models on several established benchmarks, achieved through an optimized two-phase training approach and a carefully curated, high-quality training corpus.. Experimental results show that Mutarjim rivals models up to 20 times larger while significantly reducing computational costs and training requirements. We also introduce Tarjama-25, a new benchmark designed to overcome limitations in existing Arabic-English benchmarking datasets, such as domain narrowness, short sentence lengths, and English-source bias. Tarjama-25 comprises 5,000 expert-reviewed sentence pairs and spans a wide range of domains, offering a more comprehensive and balanced evaluation framework. Notably, Mutarjim achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English-to-Arabic task in Tarjama-25, surpassing even significantly larger and proprietary models like GPT-4o mini. We publicly release Tarjama-25 to support future research and advance the evaluation of Arabic-English translation systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20282v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We trained 13,440 large language models and found that entropy minimization requires only a single unlabeled data and 10 steps optimization to achieve performance improvements comparable to or even greater than those obtained using thousands of data and carefully designed rewards in rule-based reinforcement learning. This striking result may prompt a rethinking of post-training paradigms for large language models. Our code is avaliable at https://github.com/zitian-gao/one-shot-em.</description>

      <title>Lossless Token Sequence Compression via Meta-Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing work on prompt compression for Large Language Models (LLM) focuses on lossy methods that try to maximize the retention of semantic information that is relevant to downstream tasks while significantly reducing the sequence length. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic lossless compression technique similar to LZ77 that makes it possible to reduce the input token sequence length on average by 27\% and 18\% for the two evaluation tasks explored here. Given that we use transformer-based LLMs, this equates to 47\% and 33\% less encoding computation, respectively, due to the quadratic nature of attention. The token sequence transformation is trivial to reverse and highlights that no semantic information is lost in the process. We evaluate our proposed approach on two tasks that require strict preservation of semantics/syntax and demonstrate that existing lossy compression methods perform poorly in this setting. We find that our lossless compression technique produces only a small gap in performance compared to using the uncompressed input and posit that larger models and an expanded computing budget would likely erase the gap entirely.</description>

      <title>LaMP-Cap: Personalized Figure Caption Generation With Multimodal Figure Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Figure captions are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a figure's key message. Many models have been developed to generate these captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet, authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances, these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.</description>

      <title>AraReasoner: Evaluating Reasoning-Based LLMs for Arabic NLP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08768v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in reasoning abilities and general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their performance on Arabic data, characterized by rich morphology, diverse dialects, and complex script, remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking study of multiple reasoning-focused LLMs, with a special emphasis on the newly introduced DeepSeek models, across a suite of fifteen Arabic NLP tasks. We experiment with various strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning. This allows us to systematically evaluate performance on datasets covering a range of applications to examine their capacity for linguistic reasoning under different levels of complexity. Our experiments reveal several key findings. First, carefully selecting just three in-context examples delivers an average uplift of over 13 F1 points on classification tasks-boosting sentiment analysis from 35.3% to 87.5% and paraphrase detection from 56.1% to 87.0%. Second, reasoning-focused DeepSeek architectures outperform a strong GPT o4-mini baseline by an average of 12 F1 points on complex inference tasks in the zero-shot setting. Third, LoRA-based fine-tuning yields up to an additional 8 points in F1 and BLEU compared to equivalent increases in model scale.

      <title>MFTCXplain: A Multilingual Benchmark Dataset for Evaluating the Moral Reasoning of LLMs through Hate Speech Multi-hop Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring the moral reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a growing concern as these systems are used in socially sensitive tasks. Nevertheless, current evaluation benchmarks present two major shortcomings: a lack of annotations that justify moral classifications, which limits transparency and interpretability; and a predominant focus on English, which constrains the assessment of moral reasoning across diverse cultural settings. In this paper, we introduce MFTCXplain, a multilingual benchmark dataset for evaluating the moral reasoning of LLMs via hate speech multi-hop explanation using Moral Foundation Theory (MFT). The dataset comprises 3,000 tweets across Portuguese, Italian, Persian, and English, annotated with binary hate speech labels, moral categories, and text span-level rationales. Empirical results highlight a misalignment between LLM outputs and human annotations in moral reasoning tasks. While LLMs perform well in hate speech detection (F1 up to 0.836), their ability to predict moral sentiments is notably weak (F1 &lt; 0.35). Furthermore, rationale alignment remains limited mainly in underrepresented languages. These findings show the limited capacity of current LLMs to internalize and reflect human moral reasoning.</description>

      <title>Empirical Evidence for Alignment Faking in a Small LLM and Prompt-Based Mitigation Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current literature suggests that alignment faking (deceptive alignment) is an emergent property of large language models. We present the first empirical evidence that a small instruction-tuned model, specifically LLaMA 3 8B, can exhibit alignment faking. We further show that prompt-only interventions, including deontological moral framing and scratchpad reasoning, significantly reduce this behavior without modifying model internals. This challenges the assumption that prompt-based ethics are trivial and that deceptive alignment requires scale. We introduce a taxonomy distinguishing shallow deception, shaped by context and suppressible through prompting, from deep deception, which reflects persistent, goal-driven misalignment. Our findings refine the understanding of deception in language models and underscore the need for alignment evaluations across model sizes and deployment settings.</description>

      <title>SAND: Boosting LLM Agents with Self-Taught Action Deliberation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND) framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20% improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Encode Semantics in Low-Dimensional Linear Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the latent space geometry of large language models (LLMs) is key to interpreting their behavior and improving alignment. However, it remains unclear to what extent LLMs internally organize representations related to semantic understanding. To explore this, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of hidden representations in 11 autoregressive models across 6 scientific topics. We find that high-level semantic information consistently resides in low-dimensional subspaces that form linearly separable representations across domains. This separability becomes more pronounced in deeper layers and under prompts that elicit structured reasoning or alignment behavior$\unicode{x2013}$even when surface content remains unchanged. These findings support geometry-aware tools that operate directly in latent space to detect and mitigate harmful or adversarial content. As a proof of concept, we train an MLP probe on final-layer hidden states to act as a lightweight latent-space guardrail. This approach substantially improves refusal rates on malicious queries and prompt injections that bypass both the model's built-in safety alignment and external token-level filters.</description>

      <title>Seed-X: Building Strong Multilingual Translation LLM with 7B Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13618v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilingual translation stands as a challenging task for large language models (LLMs) to handle intricate language patterns and stilted translations that arise in automated translations. In this paper, we introduce Seed-X, a family of open-source LLMs comprising instruct and reasoning models, pushing the limits of translation capability with 7B parameter size. The base model is pre-trained on a diverse, high-quality dataset encompassing both monolingual and bilingual content across 28 languages, harnessing the full potential of multilingual data. The instruct model is then finetuned to translate by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and further enhanced through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve better generalization across diverse language pairs. Seed-X achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models, including Gemini-2.5 and GPT-4o, across 28 languages, and significantly outperforms larger open-source models in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. We share the best practices through our optimization process, and make the parameter public available for advancing translation research and applications.</description>

      <title>Length Representations in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various tasks, that are learned from massive amounts of text-based data. Although LLMs can control output sequence length, particularly in instruction-based settings, the internal mechanisms behind this control have been unexplored yet. In this study, we provide empirical evidence on how output sequence length information is encoded within the internal representations in LLMs. In particular, our findings show that multi-head attention mechanisms are critical in determining output sequence length, which can be adjusted in a disentangled manner. By scaling specific hidden units within the model, we can control the output sequence length without losing the informativeness of the generated text, thereby indicating that length information is partially disentangled from semantic information. Moreover, some hidden units become increasingly active as prompts become more length-specific, thus reflecting the model's internal awareness of this attribute. Our findings suggest that LLMs have learned robust and adaptable internal mechanisms for controlling output length without any external control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce CUS-QA, a benchmark for open-ended regional question answering that encompasses both textual and visual modalities. We also provide strong baselines using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our dataset consists of manually curated questions and answers grounded in Wikipedia, created by native speakers from Czechia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, with accompanying English translations. It includes both purely textual questions and those requiring visual understanding. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs through prompting and complement this with human judgments of answer correctness. Using these human evaluations, we analyze the reliability of existing automatic evaluation metrics. Our baseline results show that even the best open-weight LLMs achieve only around 50% accuracy on textual questions and below 30% on visual questions. LLM-based evaluation metrics show strong correlation with human judgment, while traditional string-overlap metrics perform surprisingly well due to the prevalence of named entities in answers.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Memorization in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning, One Token at a Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on reasoning benchmarks but often fail when inputs alter slightly, raising concerns about the extent to which their success relies on memorization. This issue is especially acute in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, where spurious memorized patterns can trigger intermediate errors that cascade into incorrect final answers. We introduce STIM, a novel framework for Source-aware Token-level Identification of Memorization, which attributes each token in a reasoning chain to one of multiple memorization sources - local, mid-range, or long-range - based on their statistical co-occurrence with the token in the pretraining corpus. Our token-level analysis across tasks and distributional settings reveals that models rely more on memorization in complex or long-tail cases, and that local memorization is often the dominant driver of errors, leading to up to 67% of wrong tokens. We also show that memorization scores from STIM can be effective in predicting the wrong tokens in the wrong reasoning step. STIM offers a powerful tool for diagnosing and improving model reasoning and can generalize to other structured step-wise generation tasks.</description>

      <title>IBPS: Indian Bail Prediction System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bail decisions are among the most frequently adjudicated matters in Indian courts, yet they remain plagued by subjectivity, delays, and inconsistencies. With over 75% of India's prison population comprising undertrial prisoners, many from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, the lack of timely and fair bail adjudication exacerbates human rights concerns and contributes to systemic judicial backlog. In this paper, we present the Indian Bail Prediction System (IBPS), an AI-powered framework designed to assist in bail decision-making by predicting outcomes and generating legally sound rationales based solely on factual case attributes and statutory provisions. We curate and release a large-scale dataset of 150,430 High Court bail judgments, enriched with structured annotations such as age, health, criminal history, crime category, custody duration, statutes, and judicial reasoning. We fine-tune a large language model using parameter-efficient techniques and evaluate its performance across multiple configurations, with and without statutory context, and with RAG. Our results demonstrate that models fine-tuned with statutory knowledge significantly outperform baselines, achieving strong accuracy and explanation quality, and generalize well to a test set independently annotated by legal experts. IBPS offers a transparent, scalable, and reproducible solution to support data-driven legal assistance, reduce bail delays, and promote procedural fairness in the Indian judicial system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning clients embeddings from sequences of their historic communications is central to financial applications. While large language models (LLMs) offer general world knowledge, their direct use on long event sequences is computationally expensive and impractical in real-world pipelines. In this paper, we propose LATTE, a contrastive learning framework that aligns raw event embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs. Behavioral features are summarized into short prompts, embedded by the LLM, and used as supervision via contrastive loss. The proposed approach significantly reduces inference cost and input size compared to conventional processing of complete sequence by LLM. We experimentally show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for learning event sequence representations on real-world financial datasets while remaining deployable in latency-sensitive environments.</description>

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Learning (MML) aims to integrate and analyze information from diverse modalities, such as text, audio, and visuals, enabling machines to address complex tasks like sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, and multimedia retrieval. Recently, Arabic MML has reached a certain level of maturity in its foundational development, making it time to conduct a comprehensive survey. This paper explores Arabic MML by categorizing efforts through a novel taxonomy and analyzing existing research. Our taxonomy organizes these efforts into four key topics: datasets, applications, approaches, and challenges. By providing a structured overview, this survey offers insights into the current state of Arabic MML, highlighting areas that have not been investigated and critical research gaps. Researchers will be empowered to build upon the identified opportunities and address challenges to advance the field.</description>

      <title>NVIDIA Nemotron Nano 2: An Accurate and Efficient Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Reasoning Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model designed to increase throughput for reasoning workloads while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy compared to similarly-sized models. Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 builds on the Nemotron-H architecture, in which the majority of the self-attention layers in the common Transformer architecture are replaced with Mamba-2 layers, to achieve improved inference speed when generating the long thinking traces needed for reasoning. We create Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 by first pre-training a 12-billion-parameter model (Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base) on 20 trillion tokens using an FP8 training recipe. After aligning Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, we employ the Minitron strategy to compress and distill the model with the goal of enabling inference on up to 128k tokens on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU (22GiB of memory, bfloat16 precision). Compared to existing similarly-sized models (e.g., Qwen3-8B), we show that Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 achieves on-par or better accuracy on reasoning benchmarks while achieving up to 6x higher inference throughput in reasoning settings like 8k input and 16k output tokens. We are releasing Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, Nemotron-Nano12B-v2-Base, and Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base checkpoints along with the majority of our pre- and post-training datasets on Hugging Face.</description>

      <title>CRISPR-GPT for Agentic Automation of Gene-editing Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The introduction of genome engineering technology has transformed biomedical research, making it possible to make precise changes to genetic information. However, creating an efficient gene-editing system requires a deep understanding of CRISPR technology, and the complex experimental systems under investigation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various tasks, they often lack specific knowledge and struggle to accurately solve biological design problems. In this work, we introduce CRISPR-GPT, an LLM agent augmented with domain knowledge and external tools to automate and enhance the design process of CRISPR-based gene-editing experiments. CRISPR-GPT leverages the reasoning ability of LLMs to facilitate the process of selecting CRISPR systems, designing guide RNAs, recommending cellular delivery methods, drafting protocols, and designing validation experiments to confirm editing outcomes. We showcase the potential of CRISPR-GPT for assisting non-expert researchers with gene-editing experiments from scratch and validate the agent's effectiveness in a real-world use case. Furthermore, we explore the ethical and regulatory considerations associated with automated gene-editing design, highlighting the need for responsible and transparent use of these tools. Our work aims to bridge the gap between beginner biological researchers and CRISPR genome engineering techniques, and demonstrate the potential of LLM agents in facilitating complex biological discovery tasks.

      <title>MATATA: Weakly Supervised End-to-End MAthematical Tool-Augmented Reasoning for Tabular Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18915v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Business documents often contain substantial tabular and textual information with numerical values, requiring mathematical reasoning for effective document understanding. While Small Language Models (SLMs) still struggle at this task, tool-augmented multi-step agents perform better, at the cost of relying on closed-source or larger models, external data, or extensive prompt-engineering. This work introduces MATATA, a novel weakly supervised end-to-end approach to train multi-step reasoning language agents for document tabular applications. MATATA presents an annotation-free paradigm for each agent to enhance 3.8B/8B SLMs. During its two-stage training, MATATA uses the final outcome of the multi-step reasoning chain as weak supervision. This approach avoids having to individually supervise each intermediate agent in the reasoning chain. By employing an adaptive planner and shared tools across different datasets, MATATA shows robust performance. Experiments demonstrate that MATATA achieves state-of-the-art on FinQA, and on TAT-QA among reasoning methods based on open-source SLMs. Although being SLM-based, MATATA closely matches GPT-4-based frameworks on TabMWP. This novel weakly supervised approach enables training an end-to-end multi-step reasoning agent without intermediate supervision, supporting future developments of cost-effective powerful agentic systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluation Agent: Efficient and Promptable Evaluation Framework for Visual Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in visual generative models have enabled high-quality image and video generation, opening diverse applications. However, evaluating these models often demands sampling hundreds or thousands of images or videos, making the process computationally expensive, especially for diffusion-based models with inherently slow sampling. Moreover, existing evaluation methods rely on rigid pipelines that overlook specific user needs and provide numerical results without clear explanations. In contrast, humans can quickly form impressions of a model's capabilities by observing only a few samples. To mimic this, we propose the Evaluation Agent framework, which employs human-like strategies for efficient, dynamic, multi-round evaluations using only a few samples per round, while offering detailed, user-tailored analyses. It offers four key advantages: 1) efficiency, 2) promptable evaluation tailored to diverse user needs, 3) explainability beyond single numerical scores, and 4) scalability across various models and tools. Experiments show that Evaluation Agent reduces evaluation time to 10% of traditional methods while delivering comparable results. The Evaluation Agent framework is fully open-sourced to advance research in visual generative models and their efficient evaluation.</description>

      <title>InfAlign: Inference-aware language model alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19792v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language model alignment is a critical step in training modern generative language models. Alignment targets to improve win rate of a sample from the aligned model against the base model. Today, we are increasingly using inference-time algorithms (e.g., Best-of-N, controlled decoding, tree search) to decode from language models rather than standard sampling. We show that this train/test mismatch makes standard RLHF framework sub-optimal in view of such inference-time methods. To this end, we propose a framework for inference-aware alignment (InfAlign), which aims to optimize inference-time win rate of the aligned policy against the base model. We prove that for any inference-time decoding procedure, the optimal aligned policy is the solution to the standard RLHF problem with a transformation of the reward. This motivates us to provide the calibrate-and-transform RL (InfAlign-CTRL) algorithm to solve this problem, which involves a reward calibration step and a KL-regularized reward maximization step with a transformation of the calibrated reward. For best-of-N sampling and best-of-N jailbreaking, we propose specific transformations offering up to 3-8% improvement on inference-time win rates. Finally, we also show that our proposed reward calibration method is a strong baseline for optimizing standard win rate.</description>

      <title>Learning to Generate Unit Tests for Automated Debugging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unit tests (UTs) play an instrumental role in assessing code correctness as well as providing feedback to large language models (LLMs), motivating automated test generation. However, we uncover a trade-off between generating unit test inputs that reveal errors when given a faulty code and correctly predicting the unit test output without access to the gold solution. To address this trade-off, we propose UTGen, which teaches LLMs to generate unit test inputs that reveal errors along with their correct expected outputs based on task descriptions. Since model-generated tests can provide noisy signals (e.g., from incorrectly predicted outputs), we propose UTDebug that (i) scales UTGen via test-time compute to improve UT output prediction, and (ii) validates and backtracks edits based on multiple generated UTs to avoid overfitting, and helps LLMs debug effectively. We show that UTGen outperforms other LLM-based baselines by 7.59% based on a metric measuring the presence of both error-revealing UT inputs and correct UT outputs. When used with UTDebug, we find that feedback from UTGen's unit tests improves pass@1 accuracy of Qwen2.5 32B on HumanEvalFix and our own harder debugging split of MBPP+ by over 3.17% and 12.35% (respectively) over other LLM-based UT generation baselines. Moreover, we observe that feedback from Qwen2.5 32B-based UTGen model can enhance debugging with frontier LLMs like GPT-4o by 13.8%. Lastly, we demonstrate that UTGen is a better judge for code correctness, outperforming a state-of-the-art trained 8B reward model by 4.43% on HumanEval+ with best-of-10 sampling using Qwen2.5 7B.</description>

      <title>Versatile Framework for Song Generation with Prompt-based Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19062v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Song generation focuses on producing controllable high-quality songs based on various prompts. However, existing methods struggle to generate vocals and accompaniments with prompt-based control and proper alignment. Additionally, they fall short in supporting various tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce VersBand, a multi-task song generation framework for synthesizing high-quality, aligned songs with prompt-based control. VersBand comprises these primary models: 1) VocalBand, a decoupled model, leverages the flow-matching method for generating singing styles, pitches, and mel-spectrograms, allowing fast, high-quality vocal generation with style control. 2) AccompBand, a flow-based transformer model, incorporates the Band-MOE, selecting suitable experts for enhanced quality, alignment, and control. This model allows for generating controllable, high-quality accompaniments aligned with vocals. 3) Two generation models, LyricBand for lyrics and MelodyBand for melodies, contribute to the comprehensive multi-task song generation system, allowing for extensive control based on multiple prompts. Experimental results show that VersBand outperforms baseline models across multiple song generation tasks using objective and subjective metrics. Demos and codes are available at https://aaronz345.github.io/VersBandDemo and https://github.com/AaronZ345/VersBand.</description>

      <title>Flexible Tool Selection through Low-dimensional Attribute Alignment of Vision and Language</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22146v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flexible tool selection reflects a complex cognitive ability that distinguishes humans from other species, yet computational models that capture this ability remain underdeveloped. We developed a framework using low-dimensional attribute representations to bridge visual tool perception and linguistic task understanding. We constructed a comprehensive dataset (ToolNet) containing 115 common tools labeled with 13 carefully designed attributes spanning physical, functional, and psychological properties, paired with natural language scenarios describing tool usage. Visual encoders (ResNet or ViT) extract attributes from tool images while fine-tuned language models (GPT-2, LLaMA, DeepSeek) derive required attributes from task descriptions. Our approach achieves 74% accuracy in tool selection tasks-significantly outperforming direct tool matching (20%) and smaller multimodal models (21%-58%), while approaching performance of much larger models like GPT-4o (73%) with substantially fewer parameters. Human evaluation studies validate our framework's alignment with human decision-making patterns, and generalization experiments demonstrate effective performance on novel tool categories. Ablation studies revealed that manipulation-related attributes (graspability, elongation, hand-relatedness) consistently prove most critical across modalities. This work provides a parameter-efficient, interpretable solution that mimics human-like tool cognition, advancing both cognitive science understanding and practical applications in tool selection tasks.</description>

      <title>On the Fundamental Impossibility of Hallucination Control in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06382v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a fundamental impossibility theorem: no LLM capable of performing non-trivial knowledge aggregation can simultaneously achieve truthful knowledge representation, semantic information conservation, complete revelation of relevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality. The impossibility is not an engineering limitation but arises from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself.
  We establish this result by describing the inference process as an auction of ideas, where distributed components compete exploiting their partial knowledge to shape responses. The proof spans three independent mathematical domains: mechanism design theory (Green-Laffont), the theory of proper scoring rules (Savage), and direct architectural analysis of transformers (Log-Sum-Exp convexity). In particular, we show how to quantify the creation of overconfident or intuitive responses-the signature of both hallucination and creativity, or imagination.
  To support this analysis, we introduce the complementary concepts of the semantic information measure and the emergence operator to model bounded reasoning in a general setting. We prove that while bounded reasoning generates accessible information, providing valuable insights and inspirations, the idealized unconstrained reasoning strictly preserves semantic content.
  By demonstrating that hallucination and imagination are mathematically identical phenomena-grounded in departures from truthfulness, semantic information conservation, revelation of relevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality-we offer a principled foundation for managing these behaviors in advanced AI systems. Finally, we present some speculative ideas to inspire evaluation and refinements of the proposed theory.</description>

      <title>Exploring Big Five Personality and AI Capability Effects in LLM-Simulated Negotiation Dialogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15928v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation framework for agentic AI systems in mission-critical negotiation contexts, addressing the need for AI agents that can adapt to diverse human operators and stakeholders. Using Sotopia as a simulation testbed, we present two experiments that systematically evaluated how personality traits and AI agent characteristics influence LLM-simulated social negotiation outcomes--a capability essential for a variety of applications involving cross-team coordination and civil-military interactions. Experiment 1 employs causal discovery methods to measure how personality traits impact price bargaining negotiations, through which we found that Agreeableness and Extraversion significantly affect believability, goal achievement, and knowledge acquisition outcomes. Sociocognitive lexical measures extracted from team communications detected fine-grained differences in agents' empathic communication, moral foundations, and opinion patterns, providing actionable insights for agentic AI systems that must operate reliably in high-stakes operational scenarios. Experiment 2 evaluates human-AI job negotiations by manipulating both simulated human personality and AI system characteristics, specifically transparency, competence, adaptability, demonstrating how AI agent trustworthiness impact mission effectiveness. These findings establish a repeatable evaluation methodology for experimenting with AI agent reliability across diverse operator personalities and human-agent team dynamics, directly supporting operational requirements for reliable AI systems. Our work advances the evaluation of agentic AI workflows by moving beyond standard performance metrics to incorporate social dynamics essential for mission success in complex operations.</description>

      <title>Exploring Modularity of Agentic Systems for Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) and agentic systems present exciting opportunities to accelerate drug discovery. In this study, we examine the modularity of LLM-based agentic systems for drug discovery, i.e., whether parts of the system such as the LLM and type of agent are interchangeable, a topic that has received limited attention in drug discovery. We compare the performance of different LLMs and the effectiveness of tool-calling agents versus code-generating agents. Our case study, comparing performance in orchestrating tools for chemistry and drug discovery using an LLM-as-a-judge score, shows that Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4o outperform alternative language models such as Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.1-70B, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and Nova-Micro. Although we confirm that code-generating agents outperform the tool-calling ones on average, we show that this is highly question- and model-dependent. Furthermore, the impact of replacing system prompts is dependent on the question and model, underscoring that even in this particular domain one cannot just replace components of the system without re-engineering. Our study highlights the necessity of further research into the modularity of agentic systems to enable the development of reliable and modular solutions for real-world problems.</description>

      <title>The Devil is in the EOS: Sequence Training for Detailed Image Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), image captioning often suffers from a lack of detail, with base models producing short, generic captions. This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS) token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an expected increase in the rate of hallucinations.</description>

      <title>Prescriptive Agents based on RAG for Automated Maintenance (PARAM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial sectors.</description>

      <title>ThinkTuning: Instilling Cognitive Reflections without Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in test-time scaling have led to the emergence of thinking LLMs that exhibit self-reflective behaviors and multi-step reasoning. While RL drives this self-improvement paradigm, a recent study (Gandhi et al., 2025) shows that RL alone does not truly instill these new reasoning abilities - it merely draws out behaviors already present in the base models. This raises a question: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior to develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a GRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a student model with the guidance from a teacher model. A simple idea from classroom practice inspires our method: a teacher poses a problem, lets the student try an answer, then gives corrective feedback -- enough to point the mind in the right direction and then show the solution. Each piece of feedback reshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct solution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through feedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning capabilities of the student model. In particular, on average, our method shows a 3.85% improvement over zero-shot baselines across benchmarks, and on MATH-500, AIME and GPQA-Diamond it shows 2.08%, 2.23% and 3.99% improvements over the vanilla-GRPO baseline.

      <title>FinAgentBench: A Benchmark Dataset for Agentic Retrieval in Financial Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate information retrieval (IR) is critical in the financial domain, where investors must identify relevant information from large collections of documents. Traditional IR methods-whether sparse or dense-often fall short in retrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but also performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and domain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the model ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is most relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate such capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce FinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with multi-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The benchmark consists of 3,429 expert-annotated examples on S&amp;P-100 listed firms and assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document type among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected document. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning steps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a quantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance. We evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance. Our benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior in complex, domain-specific tasks for finance. We will release the dataset publicly upon acceptance of the paper and plan to expand and share dataset for the full S&amp;P 500 and beyond.</description>
