      <title>Edge-AI Perception Node for Cooperative Road-Safety Enforcement and Connected-Vehicle Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid motorization in emerging economies such as India has created severe enforcement asymmetries, with over 11 million recorded violations in 2023 against a human policing density of roughly one officer per 4000 vehicles. Traditional surveillance and manual ticketing cannot scale to this magnitude, motivating the need for an autonomous, cooperative, and energy efficient edge AI perception infrastructure. This paper presents a real time roadside perception node for multi class traffic violation analytics and safety event dissemination within a connected and intelligent vehicle ecosystem. The node integrates YOLOv8 Nano for high accuracy multi object detection, DeepSORT for temporally consistent vehicle tracking, and a rule guided OCR post processing engine capable of recognizing degraded or multilingual license plates compliant with MoRTH AIS 159 and ISO 7591 visual contrast standards. Deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano with a 128 core Maxwell GPU and optimized via TensorRT FP16 quantization, the system sustains 28 to 30 frames per second inference at 9.6 W, achieving 97.7 percent violation detection accuracy and 84.9 percent OCR precision across five violation classes, namely signal jumping, zebra crossing breach, wrong way driving, illegal U turn, and speeding, without manual region of interest calibration. Comparative benchmarking against YOLOv4 Tiny, PP YOLOE S, and Nano DetPlus demonstrates a 10.7 percent mean average precision gain and a 1.4 times accuracy per watt improvement. Beyond enforcement, the node publishes standardized safety events of CAM and DENM type to connected vehicles and intelligent transportation system backends via V2X protocols, demonstrating that roadside edge AI analytics can augment cooperative perception and proactive road safety management within the IEEE Intelligent Vehicles ecosystem.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study on Knowledge Transfer under Domain and Label Shifts in 3D LiDAR Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For 3D perception systems to be practical in real-world applications -- from autonomous driving to embodied AI -- models must adapt to continuously evolving object definitions and sensor domains. Yet, research on continual and transfer learning in 3D point cloud perception remains underexplored compared to 2D vision -- particularly under simultaneous domain and label shifts. To address this gap, we propose the RObust Autonomous driving under Dataset shifts (ROAD) benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation suite for LiDAR-based object classification that explicitly accounts for domain shifts as well as three key forms of label evolution: class split, class expansion, and class insertion. Using large-scale datasets (Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse2), we evaluate zero-shot transfer, linear probe, and CL, and analyze the impact of backbone architectures, training objectives, and CL methods. Our findings reveal limitations of existing approaches under realistic shifts and establish strong baselines for future research in robust 3D perception.</description>

      <title>Moonworks Lunara Aesthetic Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dataset spans diverse artistic styles, including regionally grounded aesthetics from the Middle East, Northern Europe, East Asia, and South Asia, alongside general categories such as sketch and oil painting. All images are generated using the Moonworks Lunara model and intentionally crafted to embody distinct, high-quality aesthetic styles, yielding a first-of-its-kind dataset with substantially higher aesthetic scores, exceeding even aesthetics-focused datasets, and general-purpose datasets by a larger margin. Each image is accompanied by a human-refined prompt and structured annotations that jointly describe salient objects, attributes, relationships, and stylistic cues. Unlike large-scale web-derived datasets that emphasize breadth over precision, the Lunara Aesthetic Dataset prioritizes aesthetic quality, stylistic diversity, and licensing transparency, and is released under the Apache 2.0 license to support research and unrestricted academic and commercial use.</description>

      <title>LWMSCNN-SE: A Lightweight Multi-Scale Network for Efficient Maize Disease Classification on Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maize disease classification plays a vital role in mitigating yield losses and ensuring food security. However, the deployment of traditional disease detection models in resource-constrained environments, such as those using smartphones and drones, faces challenges due to high computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose LWMSCNN-SE, a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates multi-scale feature extraction, depthwise separable convolutions, and squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention mechanisms. This novel combination enables the model to achieve 96.63% classification accuracy with only 241,348 parameters and 0.666 GFLOPs, making it suitable for real-time deployment in field applications. Our approach addresses the accuracy--efficiency trade-off by delivering high accuracy while maintaining low computational costs, demonstrating its potential for efficient maize disease diagnosis on edge devices in precision farming systems.</description>

      <title>3DGS-Drag: Dragging Gaussians for Intuitive Point-Based 3D Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transformative potential of 3D content creation has been progressively unlocked through advancements in generative models. Recently, intuitive drag editing with geometric changes has attracted significant attention in 2D editing yet remains challenging for 3D scenes. In this paper, we introduce 3DGS-Drag -- a point-based 3D editing framework that provides efficient, intuitive drag manipulation of real 3D scenes. Our approach bridges the gap between deformation-based and 2D-editing-based 3D editing methods, addressing their limitations to geometry-related content editing. We leverage two key innovations: deformation guidance utilizing 3D Gaussian Splatting for consistent geometric modifications and diffusion guidance for content correction and visual quality enhancement. A progressive editing strategy further supports aggressive 3D drag edits. Our method enables a wide range of edits, including motion change, shape adjustment, inpainting, and content extension. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of 3DGS-Drag in various scenes, achieving state-of-the-art performance in geometry-related 3D content editing. Notably, the editing is efficient, taking 10 to 20 minutes on a single RTX 4090 GPU.</description>

      <title>Sesame Plant Segmentation Dataset: A YOLO Formatted Annotated Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the Sesame Plant Segmentation Dataset, an open source annotated image dataset designed to support the development of artificial intelligence models for agricultural applications, with a specific focus on sesame plants. The dataset comprises 206 training images, 43 validation images, and 43 test images in YOLO compatible segmentation format, capturing sesame plants at early growth stages under varying environmental conditions. Data were collected using a high resolution mobile camera from farms in Jirdede, Daura Local Government Area, Katsina State, Nigeria, and annotated using the Segment Anything Model version 2 with farmer supervision. Unlike conventional bounding box datasets, this dataset employs pixel level segmentation to enable more precise detection and analysis of sesame plants in real world farm settings. Model evaluation using the Ultralytics YOLOv8 framework demonstrated strong performance for both detection and segmentation tasks. For bounding box detection, the model achieved a recall of 79 percent, precision of 79 percent, mean average precision at IoU 0.50 of 84 percent, and mean average precision from 0.50 to 0.95 of 58 percent. For segmentation, it achieved a recall of 82 percent, precision of 77 percent, mean average precision at IoU 0.50 of 84 percent, and mean average precision from 0.50 to 0.95 of 52 percent. The dataset represents a novel contribution to sesame focused agricultural vision datasets in Nigeria and supports applications such as plant monitoring, yield estimation, and agricultural research.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Additive Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer for Point-Level Maize Localization in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution UAV photogrammetry has become a key technology for precision agriculture, enabling centimeter-level crop monitoring and point-level plant localization. However, point-level maize localization in UAV imagery remains challenging due to (1) extremely small object-to-pixel ratios, typically less than 0.1%, (2) prohibitive computational costs of quadratic attention on ultra-high-resolution images larger than 3000 x 4000 pixels, and (3) agricultural scene-specific complexities such as sparse object distribution and environmental variability that are poorly handled by general-purpose vision models.
  To address these challenges, we propose the Additive Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (AKT), which replaces conventional multilayer perceptrons with Pade Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PKAN) modules to enhance functional expressivity for small-object feature extraction, and introduces PKAN Additive Attention (PAA) to model multiscale spatial dependencies with reduced computational complexity. In addition, we present the Point-based Maize Localization (PML) dataset, consisting of 1,928 high-resolution UAV images with approximately 501,000 point annotations collected under real field conditions.
  Extensive experiments show that AKT achieves an average F1-score of 62.8%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 4.2%, while reducing FLOPs by 12.6% and improving inference throughput by 20.7%. For downstream tasks, AKT attains a mean absolute error of 7.1 in stand counting and a root mean square error of 1.95-1.97 cm in interplant spacing estimation. These results demonstrate that integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theory with efficient attention mechanisms offers an effective framework for high-resolution agricultural remote sensing.</description>

      <title>Likelihood ratio for a binary Bayesian classifier under a noise-exclusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new statistical ideal observer model that performs holistic visual search (or gist) processing in part by placing thresholds on minimum extractable image features. In this model, the ideal observer reduces the number of free parameters thereby shrinking down the system. The applications of this novel framework is in medical image perception (for optimizing imaging systems and algorithms), computer vision, benchmarking performance and enabling feature selection/evaluations. Other applications are in target detection and recognition in defense/security as well as evaluating sensors and detectors.</description>

      <title>Predicting Region of Interest in Human Visual Search Based on Statistical Texture and Gabor Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding human visual search behavior is a fundamental problem in vision science and computer vision, with direct implications for modeling how observers allocate attention in location-unknown search tasks. In this study, we investigate the relationship between Gabor-based features and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based texture features in modeling early-stage visual search behavior. Two feature-combination pipelines are proposed to integrate Gabor and GLCM features for narrowing the region of possible human fixations. The pipelines are evaluated using simulated digital breast tomosynthesis images. Results show qualitative agreement among fixation candidates predicted by the proposed pipelines and a threshold-based model observer. A strong correlation is observed between GLCM mean and Gabor feature responses, indicating that these features encode related image information despite their different formulations. Eye-tracking data from human observers further suggest consistency between predicted fixation regions and early-stage gaze behavior. These findings highlight the value of combining structural and texture-based features for modeling visual search and support the development of perceptually informed observer models.</description>

      <title>CASHEW: Stabilizing Multimodal Reasoning via Iterative Trajectory Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models achieve strong performance across a wide range of multimodal understanding and reasoning tasks, yet their multi-step reasoning remains unstable. Repeated sampling over the same input often produces divergent reasoning trajectories and inconsistent final predictions. To address this, we introduce two complementary approaches inspired by test-time scaling: (1) CASHEW, an inference-time framework that stabilizes reasoning by iteratively aggregating multiple candidate trajectories into higher-quality reasoning traces, with explicit visual verification filtering hallucinated steps and grounding reasoning in visual evidence, and (2) CASHEW-RL, a learned variant that internalizes this aggregation behavior within a single model. CASHEW-RL is trained using Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) with a composite reward that encourages correct answers grounded in minimal yet sufficient visual evidence, while adaptively allocating reasoning effort based on task difficulty. This training objective enables robust self-aggregation at inference. Extensive experiments on 13 image understanding, video understanding, and video reasoning benchmarks show significant performance improvements, including gains of up to +23.6 percentage points on ScienceQA and +8.1 percentage points on EgoSchema.</description>

      <title>TP-Blend: Textual-Prompt Attention Pairing for Precise Object-Style Blending in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current text-conditioned diffusion editors handle single object replacement well but struggle when a new object and a new style must be introduced simultaneously. We present Twin-Prompt Attention Blend (TP-Blend), a lightweight training-free framework that receives two separate textual prompts, one specifying a blend object and the other defining a target style, and injects both into a single denoising trajectory. TP-Blend is driven by two complementary attention processors. Cross-Attention Object Fusion (CAOF) first averages head-wise attention to locate spatial tokens that respond strongly to either prompt, then solves an entropy-regularised optimal transport problem that reassigns complete multi-head feature vectors to those positions. CAOF updates feature vectors at the full combined dimensionality of all heads (e.g., 640 dimensions in SD-XL), preserving rich cross-head correlations while keeping memory low. Self-Attention Style Fusion (SASF) injects style at every self-attention layer through Detail-Sensitive Instance Normalization. A lightweight one-dimensional Gaussian filter separates low- and high-frequency components; only the high-frequency residual is blended back, imprinting brush-stroke-level texture without disrupting global geometry. SASF further swaps the Key and Value matrices with those derived from the style prompt, enforcing context-aware texture modulation that remains independent of object fusion. Extensive experiments show that TP-Blend produces high-resolution, photo-realistic edits with precise control over both content and appearance, surpassing recent baselines in quantitative fidelity, perceptual quality, and inference speed.</description>

      <title>Decoder Generates Manufacturable Structures: A Framework for 3D-Printable Object Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel decoder-based approach for generating manufacturable 3D structures optimized for additive manufacturing. We introduce a deep learning framework that decodes latent representations into geometrically valid, printable objects while respecting manufacturing constraints such as overhang angles, wall thickness, and structural integrity. The methodology demonstrates that neural decoders can learn complex mapping functions from abstract representations to valid 3D geometries, producing parts with significantly improved manufacturability compared to naive generation approaches. We validate the approach on diverse object categories and demonstrate practical 3D printing of decoder-generated structures.</description>

      <title>Representations of Text and Images Align From Layer One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for a variety of concepts in adapter-based vision-language models, the representations of their images and their text descriptions are meaningfully aligned from the very first layer. This contradicts the established view that such image-text alignment only appears in late layers. We show this using a new synthesis-based method inspired by DeepDream: given a textual concept such as "Jupiter", we extract its concept vector at a given layer, and then use optimisation to synthesise an image whose representation aligns with that vector. We apply our approach to hundreds of concepts across seven layers in Gemma 3, and find that the synthesised images often depict salient visual features of the targeted textual concepts: for example, already at layer 1, more than 50 % of images depict recognisable features of animals, activities, or seasons. Our method thus provides direct, constructive evidence of image-text alignment on a concept-by-concept and layer-by-layer basis. Unlike previous methods for measuring multimodal alignment, our approach is simple, fast, and does not require auxiliary models or datasets. It also offers a new path towards model interpretability, by providing a way to visualise a model's representation space by backtracing through its image processing components.</description>

      <title>Training Free Zero-Shot Visual Anomaly Localization via Diffusion Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-Shot image Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) aims to detect and localise anomalies without access to any normal training samples of the target data. While recent ZSAD approaches leverage additional modalities such as language to generate fine-grained prompts for localisation, vision-only methods remain limited to image-level classification, lacking spatial precision. In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective training-free vision-only ZSAD framework that circumvents the need for fine-grained prompts by leveraging the inversion of a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM). Specifically, given an input image and a generic text description (e.g., "an image of an [object class]"), we invert the image to obtain latent representations and initiate the denoising process from a fixed intermediate timestep to reconstruct the image. Since the underlying diffusion model is trained solely on normal data, this process yields a normal-looking reconstruction. The discrepancy between the input image and the reconstructed one highlights potential anomalies. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VISA dataset, demonstrating strong localisation capabilities without auxiliary modalities and facilitating a shift away from prompt dependence for zero-shot anomaly detection research.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maintaining or improving the performance of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) through fine-tuning requires labeling newly collected inputs, a process that is often costly and time-consuming. To alleviate this problem, input selection approaches have been developed in recent years to identify small, yet highly informative subsets for labeling. Diversity-based selection is one of the most effective approaches for this purpose. However, they are often computationally intensive and lack scalability for large input sets, limiting their practical applicability. To address this challenge, we introduce Concept-Based Diversity (CBD), a highly efficient metric for image inputs that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLM). Our results show that CBD exhibits a strong correlation with Geometric Diversity (GD), an established diversity metric, while requiring only a fraction of its computation time. Building on this finding, we propose a hybrid input selection approach that combines CBD with Margin, a simple uncertainty metric. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across a diverse set of DNN models, input sets, selection budgets, and five most effective state-of-the-art selection baselines. The results demonstrate that the CBD-based selection consistently outperforms all baselines at guiding input selection to improve the DNN model. Furthermore, the CBD-based selection approach remains highly efficient, requiring selection times close to those of simple uncertainty-based methods such as Margin, even on larger input sets like ImageNet. These results confirm not only the effectiveness and computational advantage of the CBD-based approach, particularly compared to hybrid baselines, but also its scalability in repetitive and extensive input selection scenarios.</description>

      <title>FigEx2: Visual-Conditioned Panel Detection and Captioning for Scientific Compound Figures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific compound figures combine multiple labeled panels into a single image, but captions in real pipelines are often missing or only provide figure-level summaries, making panel-level understanding difficult. In this paper, we propose FigEx2, visual-conditioned framework that localizes panels and generates panel-wise captions directly from the compound figure. To mitigate the impact of diverse phrasing in open-ended captioning, we introduce a noise-aware gated fusion module that adaptively filters token-level features to stabilize the detection query space. Furthermore, we employ a staged optimization strategy combining supervised learning with reinforcement learning (RL), utilizing CLIP-based alignment and BERTScore-based semantic rewards to enforce strict multimodal consistency. To support high-quality supervision, we curate BioSci-Fig-Cap, a refined benchmark for panel-level grounding, alongside cross-disciplinary test suites in physics and chemistry. Experimental results demonstrate that FigEx2 achieves a superior 0.726 mAP@0.5:0.95 for detection and significantly outperforms Qwen3-VL-8B by 0.51 in METEOR and 0.24 in BERTScore. Notably, FigEx2 exhibits remarkable zero-shot transferability to out-of-distribution scientific domains without any fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Rescind: Countering Image Misconduct in Biomedical Publications with Vision-Language and State-Space Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific image manipulation in biomedical publications poses a growing threat to research integrity and reproducibility. Unlike natural image forensics, biomedical forgery detection is uniquely challenging due to domain-specific artifacts, complex textures, and unstructured figure layouts. We present the first vision-language guided framework for both generating and detecting biomedical image forgeries. By combining diffusion-based synthesis with vision-language prompting, our method enables realistic and semantically controlled manipulations, including duplication, splicing, and region removal, across diverse biomedical modalities. We introduce Rescind, a large-scale benchmark featuring fine-grained annotations and modality-specific splits, and propose Integscan, a structured state space modeling framework that integrates attention-enhanced visual encoding with prompt-conditioned semantic alignment for precise forgery localization. To ensure semantic fidelity, we incorporate a vision-language model based verification loop that filters generated forgeries based on consistency with intended prompts. Extensive experiments on Rescind and existing benchmarks demonstrate that Integscan achieves state of the art performance in both detection and localization, establishing a strong foundation for automated scientific integrity analysis.</description>

      <title>The Role of Noisy Data in Improving CNN Robustness for Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data quality plays a central role in the performance and robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification. While high-quality data is often preferred for training, real-world inputs are frequently affected by noise and other distortions. This paper investigates the effect of deliberately introducing controlled noise into the training data to improve model robustness. Using the CIFAR-10 dataset, we evaluate the impact of three common corruptions, namely Gaussian noise, Salt-and-Pepper noise, and Gaussian blur at varying intensities and training set pollution levels. Experiments using a Resnet-18 model reveal that incorporating just 10\% noisy data during training is sufficient to significantly reduce test loss and enhance accuracy under fully corrupted test conditions, with minimal impact on clean-data performance. These findings suggest that strategic exposure to noise can act as a simple yet effective regularizer, offering a practical trade-off between traditional data cleanliness and real-world resilience.</description>

      <title>Exploiting DINOv3-Based Self-Supervised Features for Robust Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic medical image segmentation plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning but remains challenging in few-shot scenarios due to the scarcity of annotated training data. Recently, self-supervised foundation models such as DINOv3, which were trained on large natural image datasets, have shown strong potential for dense feature extraction that can help with the few-shot learning challenge. Yet, their direct application to medical images is hindered by domain differences. In this work, we propose DINO-AugSeg, a novel framework that leverages DINOv3 features to address the few-shot medical image segmentation challenge. Specifically, we introduce WT-Aug, a wavelet-based feature-level augmentation module that enriches the diversity of DINOv3-extracted features by perturbing frequency components, and CG-Fuse, a contextual information-guided fusion module that exploits cross-attention to integrate semantic-rich low-resolution features with spatially detailed high-resolution features. Extensive experiments on six public benchmarks spanning five imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, endoscopy, and dermoscopy, demonstrate that DINO-AugSeg consistently outperforms existing methods under limited-sample conditions. The results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating wavelet-domain augmentation and contextual fusion for robust feature representation, suggesting DINO-AugSeg as a promising direction for advancing few-shot medical image segmentation. Code and data will be made available on https://github.com/apple1986/DINO-AugSeg.</description>

      <title>From Prompts to Deployment: Auto-Curated Domain-Specific Dataset Generation via Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an automated pipeline for generating domain-specific synthetic datasets with diffusion models, addressing the distribution shift between pre-trained models and real-world deployment environments. Our three-stage framework first synthesizes target objects within domain-specific backgrounds through controlled inpainting. The generated outputs are then validated via a multi-modal assessment that integrates object detection, aesthetic scoring, and vision-language alignment. Finally, a user-preference classifier is employed to capture subjective selection criteria. This pipeline enables the efficient construction of high-quality, deployable datasets while reducing reliance on extensive real-world data collection.</description>

      <title>PathoGen: Diffusion-Based Synthesis of Realistic Lesions in Histopathology Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of robust artificial intelligence models for histopathology diagnosis is severely constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated lesion data, particularly for rare pathologies and underrepresented disease subtypes. While data augmentation offers a potential solution, existing methods fail to generate sufficiently realistic lesion morphologies that preserve the complex spatial relationships and cellular architectures characteristic of histopathological tissues. Here we present PathoGen, a diffusion-based generative model that enables controllable, high-fidelity inpainting of lesions into benign histopathology images. Unlike conventional augmentation techniques, PathoGen leverages the iterative refinement process of diffusion models to synthesize lesions with natural tissue boundaries, preserved cellular structures, and authentic staining characteristics. We validate PathoGen across four diverse datasets representing distinct diagnostic challenges: kidney, skin, breast, and prostate pathology. Quantitative assessment confirms that PathoGen outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines, including conditional GAN and Stable Diffusion, in image fidelity and distributional similarity. Crucially, we show that augmenting training sets with PathoGen-synthesized lesions enhances downstream segmentation performance compared to traditional geometric augmentations, particularly in data-scarce regimes. Besides, by simultaneously generating realistic morphology and pixel-level ground truth, PathoGen effectively overcomes the manual annotation bottleneck. This approach offers a scalable pathway for developing generalizable medical AI systems despite limited expert-labeled data.</description>

      <title>How Do Optical Flow and Textual Prompts Collaborate to Assist in Audio-Visual Semantic Segmentation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-visual semantic segmentation (AVSS) represents an extension of the audio-visual segmentation (AVS) task, necessitating a semantic understanding of audio-visual scenes beyond merely identifying sound-emitting objects at the visual pixel level. Contrary to a previous methodology, by decomposing the AVSS task into two discrete subtasks by initially providing a prompted segmentation mask to facilitate subsequent semantic analysis, our approach innovates on this foundational strategy. We introduce a novel collaborative framework, \textit{S}tepping \textit{S}tone \textit{P}lus (SSP), which integrates optical flow and textual prompts to assist the segmentation process. In scenarios where sound sources frequently coexist with moving objects, our pre-mask technique leverages optical flow to capture motion dynamics, providing essential temporal context for precise segmentation. To address the challenge posed by stationary sound-emitting objects, such as alarm clocks, SSP incorporates two specific textual prompts: one identifies the category of the sound-emitting object, and the other provides a broader description of the scene. Additionally, we implement a visual-textual alignment module (VTA) to facilitate cross-modal integration, delivering more coherent and contextually relevant semantic interpretations. Our training regimen involves a post-mask technique aimed at compelling the model to learn the diagram of the optical flow. Experimental results demonstrate that SSP outperforms existing AVS methods, delivering efficient and precise segmentation results.</description>

      <title>Subspace Alignment for Vision-Language Model Test-time Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), despite their extraordinary zero-shot capabilities, are vulnerable to distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation (TTA) emerges as a predominant strategy to adapt VLMs to unlabeled test data on the fly. However, existing TTA methods heavily rely on zero-shot predictions as pseudo-labels for self-training, which can be unreliable under distribution shifts and misguide adaptation due to two fundamental limitations. First (Modality Gap), distribution shifts induce gaps between visual and textual modalities, making cross-modal relations inaccurate. Second (Visual Nuisance), visual embeddings encode rich but task-irrelevant noise that often overwhelms task-specific semantics under distribution shifts. To address these limitations, we propose SubTTA, which aligns the semantic subspaces of both modalities to enhance zero-shot predictions to better guide the TTA process. To bridge the modality gap, SubTTA extracts the principal subspaces of both modalities and aligns the visual manifold to the textual semantic anchor by minimizing their chordal distance. To eliminate visual nuisance, SubTTA projects the aligned visual features onto the task-specific textual subspace, which filters out task-irrelevant noise by constraining visual embeddings within the valid semantic span, and standard TTA is further performed on the purified space to refine the decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and VLM architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of SubTTA, yielding an average improvement of 2.24% over state-of-the-art TTA methods.</description>

      <title>Where Does Vision Meet Language? Understanding and Refining Visual Fusion in MLLMs via Contrastive Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language understanding, yet how they internally integrate visual and textual information remains poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we perform a systematic layer-wise masking analysis across multiple architectures, revealing how visual-text fusion evolves within MLLMs. The results show that fusion emerges at several specific layers rather than being uniformly distributed across the network, and certain models exhibit a late-stage "review" phenomenon where visual signals are reactivated before output generation. Besides, we further analyze layer-wise attention evolution and observe persistent high-attention noise on irrelevant regions, along with gradually increasing attention on text-aligned areas. Guided by these insights, we introduce a training-free contrastive attention framework that models the transformation between early fusion and final layers to highlight meaningful attention shifts. Extensive experiments across various MLLMs and benchmarks validate our analysis and demonstrate that the proposed approach improves multimodal reasoning performance. Code will be released.</description>

      <title>Instance-Aligned Captions for Explainable Video Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for safety-critical applications, yet even with recent progress, much of the research still lacks spatial grounding, making the explanations unverifiable. This limitation is especially pronounced in multi-entity interactions, where existing explainable VAD methods often produce incomplete or visually misaligned descriptions, reducing their trustworthiness. To address these challenges, we introduce instance-aligned captions that link each textual claim to specific object instances with appearance and motion attributes. Our framework captures who caused the anomaly, what each entity was doing, whom it affected, and where the explanationis grounded, enabling verifiable and actionable reasoning. We annotate eight widely used VAD benchmarks and extend the 360-degree egocentric dataset, VIEW360, with 868 additional videos, eight locations, and four new anomaly types, creating VIEW360+, a comprehensive testbed for explainable VAD. Experiments show that our instance-level spatially grounded captions reveal significant limitations in current LLM- and VLM-based methods while providing a robust benchmark for future research in trustworthy and interpretable anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>A Hardware-Algorithm Co-Designed Framework for HDR Imaging and Dehazing in Extreme Rocket Launch Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative optical measurement of critical mechanical parameters -- such as plume flow fields, shock wave structures, and nozzle oscillations -- during rocket launch faces severe challenges due to extreme imaging conditions. Intense combustion creates dense particulate haze and luminance variations exceeding 120 dB, degrading image data and undermining subsequent photogrammetric and velocimetric analyses. To address these issues, we propose a hardware-algorithm co-design framework that combines a custom Spatially Varying Exposure (SVE) sensor with a physics-aware dehazing algorithm. The SVE sensor acquires multi-exposure data in a single shot, enabling robust haze assessment without relying on idealized atmospheric models. Our approach dynamically estimates haze density, performs region-adaptive illumination optimization, and applies multi-scale entropy-constrained fusion to effectively separate haze from scene radiance. Validated on real launch imagery and controlled experiments, the framework demonstrates superior performance in recovering physically accurate visual information of the plume and engine region. This offers a reliable image basis for extracting key mechanical parameters, including particle velocity, flow instability frequency, and structural vibration, thereby supporting precise quantitative analysis in extreme aerospace environments.</description>

      <title>Representation Learning with Semantic-aware Instance and Sparse Token Alignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical contrastive vision-language pre-training (VLP) has demonstrated significant potential in improving performance on downstream tasks. Traditional approaches typically employ contrastive learning, treating paired image-report samples as positives and unpaired ones as negatives. However, in medical datasets, there can be substantial similarities between images or reports from different patients. Rigidly treating all unpaired samples as negatives, can disrupt the underlying semantic structure and negatively impact the quality of the learned representations. In this paper, we propose a multi-level alignment framework, Representation Learning with Semantic-aware Instance and Sparse Token Alignments (SISTA) by exploiting the semantic correspondence between medical image and radiology reports at two levels, i.e., image-report and patch-word levels. Specifically, we improve the conventional contrastive learning by incorporating inter-report similarity to eliminate the false negatives and introduce a method to effectively align image patches with relevant word tokens. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving transfer performance across different datasets on three downstream tasks: image classification, image segmentation, and object detection. Notably, our framework achieves significant improvements in fine-grained tasks even with limited labeled data. Codes and pre-trained models will be made available.</description>

Abstract: This technical report represents the award-winning solution to the Cross-platform 3D Object Detection task in the RoboSense2025 Challenge. Our approach is built upon PVRCNN++, an efficient 3D object detection framework that effectively integrates point-based and voxel-based features. On top of this foundation, we improve cross-platform generalization by narrowing domain gaps through tailored data augmentation and a self-training strategy with pseudo-labels. These enhancements enabled our approach to secure the 3rd place in the challenge, achieving a 3D AP of 62.67% for the Car category on the phase-1 target domain, and 58.76% and 49.81% for Car and Pedestrian categories respectively on the phase-2 target domain.</description>

      <title>CogniMap3D: Cognitive 3D Mapping and Rapid Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present CogniMap3D, a bioinspired framework for dynamic 3D scene understanding and reconstruction that emulates human cognitive processes. Our approach maintains a persistent memory bank of static scenes, enabling efficient spatial knowledge storage and rapid retrieval. CogniMap3D integrates three core capabilities: a multi-stage motion cue framework for identifying dynamic objects, a cognitive mapping system for storing, recalling, and updating static scenes across multiple visits, and a factor graph optimization strategy for refining camera poses. Given an image stream, our model identifies dynamic regions through motion cues with depth and camera pose priors, then matches static elements against its memory bank.

      <title>Instruction-Driven 3D Facial Expression Generation and Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 3D avatar typically has one of six cardinal facial expressions. To simulate realistic emotional variation, we should be able to render a facial transition between two arbitrary expressions. This study presents a new framework for instruction-driven facial expression generation that produces a 3D face and, starting from an image of the face, transforms the facial expression from one designated facial expression to another. The Instruction-driven Facial Expression Decomposer (IFED) module is introduced to facilitate multimodal data learning and capture the correlation between textual descriptions and facial expression features. Subsequently, we propose the Instruction to Facial Expression Transition (I2FET) method, which leverages IFED and a vertex reconstruction loss function to refine the semantic comprehension of latent vectors, thus generating a facial expression sequence according to the given instruction. Lastly, we present the Facial Expression Transition model to generate smooth transitions between facial expressions. Extensive evaluation suggests that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the CK+ and CelebV-HQ datasets. The results show that our framework can generate facial expression trajectories according to text instruction. Considering that text prompts allow us to make diverse descriptions of human emotional states, the repertoire of facial expressions and the transitions between them can be expanded greatly. We expect our framework to find various practical applications More information about our project can be found at https://vohoanganh.github.io/tg3dfet/</description>

      <title>Second-order Gaussian directional derivative representations for image high-resolution corner detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Corner detection is widely used in various computer vision tasks, such as image matching and 3D reconstruction. Our research indicates that there are theoretical flaws in Zhang et al.'s use of a simple corner model to obtain a series of corner characteristics, as the grayscale information of two adjacent corners can affect each other. In order to address the above issues, a second-order Gaussian directional derivative (SOGDD) filter is used in this work to smooth two typical high-resolution angle models (i.e. END-type and L-type models). Then, the SOGDD representations of these two corner models were derived separately, and many characteristics of high-resolution corners were discovered, which enabled us to demonstrate how to select Gaussian filtering scales to obtain intensity variation information from images, accurately depicting adjacent corners. In addition, a new high-resolution corner detection method for images has been proposed for the first time, which can accurately detect adjacent corner points. The experimental results have verified that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of localization error, robustness to image blur transformation, image matching, and 3D reconstruction.</description>

      <title>GI-Bench: A Panoramic Benchmark Revealing the Knowledge-Experience Dissociation of Multimodal Large Language Models in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Against Clinical Standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise in gastroenterology, yet their performance against comprehensive clinical workflows and human benchmarks remains unverified. To systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs across a panoramic gastrointestinal endoscopy workflow and determine their clinical utility compared with human endoscopists. We constructed GI-Bench, a benchmark encompassing 20 fine-grained lesion categories. Twelve MLLMs were evaluated across a five-stage clinical workflow: anatomical localization, lesion identification, diagnosis, findings description, and management. Model performance was benchmarked against three junior endoscopists and three residency trainees using Macro-F1, mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), and multi-dimensional Likert scale. Gemini-3-Pro achieved state-of-the-art performance. In diagnostic reasoning, top-tier models (Macro-F1 0.641) outperformed trainees (0.492) and rivaled junior endoscopists (0.727; p&gt;0.05). However, a critical "spatial grounding bottleneck" persisted; human lesion localization (mIoU &gt;0.506) significantly outperformed the best model (0.345; p&lt;0.05). Furthermore, qualitative analysis revealed a "fluency-accuracy paradox": models generated reports with superior linguistic readability compared with humans (p&lt;0.05) but exhibited significantly lower factual correctness (p&lt;0.05) due to "over-interpretation" and hallucination of visual features.GI-Bench maintains a dynamic leaderboard that tracks the evolving performance of MLLMs in clinical endoscopy.

      <title>Human-inspired Global-to-Parallel Multi-scale Encoding for Lightweight Vision Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lightweight vision networks have witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, yet achieving a satisfactory balance among parameter scale, computational overhead, and task performance remains difficult. Although many existing lightweight models manage to reduce computation considerably, they often do so at the expense of a substantial increase in parameter count (e.g., LSNet, MobileMamba), which still poses obstacles for deployment on resource-limited devices. In parallel, some studies attempt to draw inspiration from human visual perception, but their modeling tends to oversimplify the visual process, making it hard to reflect how perception truly operates. Revisiting the cooperative mechanism of the human visual system, we propose GPM (Global-to-Parallel Multi-scale Encoding). GPM first employs a Global Insight Generator (GIG) to extract holistic cues, and subsequently processes features of different scales through parallel branches: LSAE emphasizes mid-/large-scale semantic relations, while IRB (Inverted Residual Block) preserves fine-grained texture information, jointly enabling coherent representation of global and local features. As such, GPM conforms to two characteristic behaviors of human vision perceiving the whole before focusing on details, and maintaining broad contextual awareness even during local attention. Built upon GPM, we further develop the lightweight H-GPE network. Experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation show that H-GPE achieves strong performance while maintaining a balanced footprint in both FLOPs and parameters, delivering a more favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off compared with recent state-of-the-art lightweight models.</description>

      <title>Route, Retrieve, Reflect, Repair: Self-Improving Agentic Framework for Visual Detection and Linguistic Reasoning in Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image analysis increasingly relies on large vision-language models (VLMs), yet most systems remain single-pass black boxes that offer limited control over reasoning, safety, and spatial grounding. We propose R^4, an agentic framework that decomposes medical imaging workflows into four coordinated agents: a Router that configures task- and specialization-aware prompts from the image, patient history, and metadata; a Retriever that uses exemplar memory and pass@k sampling to jointly generate free-text reports and bounding boxes; a Reflector that critiques each draft-box pair for key clinical error modes (negation, laterality, unsupported claims, contradictions, missing findings, and localization errors); and a Repairer that iteratively revises both narrative and spatial outputs under targeted constraints while curating high-quality exemplars for future cases. Instantiated on chest X-ray analysis with multiple modern VLM backbones and evaluated on report generation and weakly supervised detection, R^4 consistently boosts LLM-as-a-Judge scores by roughly +1.7-+2.5 points and mAP50 by +2.5-+3.5 absolute points over strong single-VLM baselines, without any gradient-based fine-tuning. These results show that agentic routing, reflection, and repair can turn strong but brittle VLMs into more reliable and better grounded tools for clinical image interpretation.

      <title>Unified Multi-Site Multi-Sequence Brain MRI Harmonization Enriched by Biomedical Semantic Style</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aggregating multi-site brain MRI data can enhance deep learning model training, but also introduces non-biological heterogeneity caused by site-specific variations (e.g., differences in scanner vendors, acquisition parameters, and imaging protocols) that can undermine generalizability. Recent retrospective MRI harmonization seeks to reduce such site effects by standardizing image style (e.g., intensity, contrast, noise patterns) while preserving anatomical content. However, existing methods often rely on limited paired traveling-subject data or fail to effectively disentangle style from anatomy. Furthermore, most current approaches address only single-sequence harmonization, restricting their use in real-world settings where multi-sequence MRI is routinely acquired. To this end, we introduce MMH, a unified framework for multi-site multi-sequence brain MRI harmonization that leverages biomedical semantic priors for sequence-aware style alignment. MMH operates in two stages: (1) a diffusion-based global harmonizer that maps MR images to a sequence-specific unified domain using style-agnostic gradient conditioning, and (2) a target-specific fine-tuner that adapts globally aligned images to desired target domains. A tri-planar attention BiomedCLIP encoder aggregates multi-view embeddings to characterize volumetric style information, allowing explicit disentanglement of image styles from anatomy without requiring paired data. Evaluations on 4,163 T1- and T2-weighted MRIs demonstrate MMH's superior harmonization over state-of-the-art methods in image feature clustering, voxel-level comparison, tissue segmentation, and downstream age and site classification.</description>

      <title>MobiDiary: Autoregressive Action Captioning with Wearable Devices and Wireless Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) in smart homes is critical for health monitoring and assistive living. While vision-based systems are common, they face privacy concerns and environmental limitations (e.g., occlusion). In this work, we present MobiDiary, a framework that generates natural language descriptions of daily activities directly from heterogeneous physical signals (specifically IMU and Wi-Fi). Unlike conventional approaches that restrict outputs to pre-defined labels, MobiDiary produces expressive, human-readable summaries. To bridge the semantic gap between continuous, noisy physical signals and discrete linguistic descriptions, we propose a unified sensor encoder. Instead of relying on modality-specific engineering, we exploit the shared inductive biases of motion-induced signals--where both inertial and wireless data reflect underlying kinematic dynamics. Specifically, our encoder utilizes a patch-based mechanism to capture local temporal correlations and integrates heterogeneous placement embedding to unify spatial contexts across different sensors. These unified signal tokens are then fed into a Transformer-based decoder, which employs an autoregressive mechanism to generate coherent action descriptions word-by-word. We comprehensively evaluate our approach on multiple public benchmarks (XRF V2, UWash, and WiFiTAD). Experimental results demonstrate that MobiDiary effectively generalizes across modalities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on captioning metrics (e.g., BLEU@4, CIDEr, RMC) and outperforming specialized baselines in continuous action understanding.</description>

      <title>FUME: Fused Unified Multi-Gas Emission Network for Livestock Rumen Acidosis Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruminal acidosis is a prevalent metabolic disorder in dairy cattle causing significant economic losses and animal welfare concerns. Current diagnostic methods rely on invasive pH measurement, limiting scalability for continuous monitoring. We present FUME (Fused Unified Multi-gas Emission Network), the first deep learning approach for rumen acidosis detection from dual-gas optical imaging under in vitro conditions. Our method leverages complementary carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emission patterns captured by infrared cameras to classify rumen health into Healthy, Transitional, and Acidotic states. FUME employs a lightweight dual-stream architecture with weight-shared encoders, modality-specific self-attention, and channel attention fusion, jointly optimizing gas plume segmentation and classification of dairy cattle health. We introduce the first dual-gas OGI dataset comprising 8,967 annotated frames across six pH levels with pixel-level segmentation masks. Experiments demonstrate that FUME achieves 80.99% mIoU and 98.82% classification accuracy while using only 1.28M parameters and 1.97G MACs--outperforming state-of-the-art methods in segmentation quality with 10x lower computational cost. Ablation studies reveal that CO2 provides the primary discriminative signal and dual-task learning is essential for optimal performance. Our work establishes the feasibility of gas emission-based livestock health monitoring, paving the way for practical, in vitro acidosis detection systems.

Abstract: This research analyzed and compared the multi-modal approach in the Vision Transformer(EVA-ViT) based image encoder with the LlaMA or ChatGPT LLM to reduce the hallucination problem and detect diseases in chest x-ray images. In this research, we utilized the NIH Chest X-ray image to train the model and compared it in image-based RAG, text-based RAG, and baseline. [3] [5] In a result, the text-based RAG[2] e!ectively reduces the hallucination problem by using external knowledge information, and the image-based RAG improved the prediction con"dence and calibration by using the KNN methods. [4] Moreover, the GPT LLM showed better performance, a low hallucination rate, and better Expected Calibration Error(ECE) than Llama Llama-based model. This research shows the challenge of data imbalance, a complex multi-stage structure, but suggests a large experience environment and a balanced example of use.</description>

      <title>Improving Zero-shot ADL Recognition with Large Language Models through Event-based Context and Confidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unobtrusive sensor-based recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in smart homes by processing data collected from IoT sensing devices supports applications such as healthcare, safety, and energy management. Recent zero-shot methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have the advantage of removing the reliance on labeled ADL sensor data. However, existing approaches rely on time-based segmentation, which is poorly aligned with the contextual reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Moreover, existing approaches lack methods for estimating prediction confidence. This paper proposes to improve zero-shot ADL recognition with event-based segmentation and a novel method for estimating prediction confidence. Our experimental evaluation shows that event-based segmentation consistently outperforms time-based LLM approaches on complex, realistic datasets and surpasses supervised data-driven methods, even with relatively small LLMs (e.g., Gemma 3 27B). The proposed confidence measure effectively distinguishes correct from incorrect predictions.</description>

      <title>AIMC-Spec: A Benchmark Dataset for Automatic Intrapulse Modulation Classification under Variable Noise Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A lack of standardized datasets has long hindered progress in automatic intrapulse modulation classification (AIMC) - a critical task in radar signal analysis for electronic support systems, particularly under noisy or degraded conditions. AIMC seeks to identify the modulation type embedded within a single radar pulse from its complex in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) representation, enabling automated interpretation of intrapulse structure. This paper introduces AIMC-Spec, a comprehensive synthetic dataset for spectrogram-based image classification, encompassing 33 modulation types across 13 signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. To benchmark AIMC-Spec, five representative deep learning algorithms - ranging from lightweight CNNs and denoising architectures to transformer-based networks - were re-implemented and evaluated under a unified input format. The results reveal significant performance variation, with frequency-modulated (FM) signals classified more reliably than phase or hybrid types, particularly at low SNRs. A focused FM-only test further highlights how modulation type and network architecture influence classifier robustness. AIMC-Spec establishes a reproducible baseline and provides a foundation for future research and standardization in the AIMC domain.</description>

      <title>HIPPO: Accelerating Video Large Language Models Inference via Holistic-aware Parallel Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate LLM inference without sacrificing output quality. Existing SD methods tailored for video-LLMs primarily focus on pruning redundant visual tokens to mitigate the computational burden of massive visual inputs. However, existing methods do not achieve inference acceleration comparable to text-only LLMs. We observe from extensive experiments that this phenomenon mainly stems from two limitations: (i) their pruning strategies inadequately preserve visual semantic tokens, degrading draft quality and acceptance rates; (ii) even with aggressive pruning (e.g., 90% visual tokens removed), the draft model's remaining inference cost limits overall speedup. To address these limitations, we propose HIPPO, a general holistic-aware parallel speculative decoding framework. Specifically, HIPPO proposes (i) a semantic-aware token preservation method, which fuses global attention scores with local visual semantics to retain semantic information at high pruning ratios; (ii) a video parallel SD algorithm that decouples and overlaps draft generation and target verification phases. Experiments on four video-LLMs across six benchmarks demonstrate HIPPO's effectiveness, yielding up to 3.51x speedup compared to vanilla auto-regressive decoding.</description>

      <title>One-Shot Identification with Different Neural Network Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in the computer vision community, significantly improving the state-of-the-art. But learning good features often is computationally expensive in machine learning settings and is especially difficult when there is a lack of data. One-shot learning is one such area where only limited data is available. In one-shot learning, predictions have to be made after seeing only one example from one class, which requires special techniques. In this paper we explore different approaches to one-shot identification tasks in different domains including an industrial application and face recognition. We use a special technique with stacked images and use siamese capsule networks. It is encouraging to see that the approach using capsule architecture achieves strong results and exceeds other techniques on a wide range of datasets from industrial application to face recognition benchmarks while being easy to use and optimise.</description>

      <title>KidVis: Do Multimodal Large Language Models Possess the Visual Perceptual Capabilities of a 6-Year-Old?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive proficiency in high-level reasoning tasks, such as complex diagrammatic interpretation, it remains an open question whether they possess the fundamental visual primitives comparable to human intuition. To investigate this, we introduce KidVis, a novel benchmark grounded in the theory of human visual development. KidVis deconstructs visual intelligence into six atomic capabilities - Concentration, Tracking, Discrimination, Memory, Spatial, and Closure - already possessed by 6-7 year old children, comprising 10 categories of low-semantic-dependent visual tasks. Evaluating 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs against a human physiological baseline reveals a stark performance disparity. Results indicate that while human children achieve a near-perfect average score of 95.32, the state-of-the-art GPT-5 attains only 67.33. Crucially, we observe a "Scaling Law Paradox": simply increasing model parameters fails to yield linear improvements in these foundational visual capabilities. This study confirms that current MLLMs, despite their reasoning prowess, lack the essential physiological perceptual primitives required for generalized visual intelligence.</description>

      <title>M3SR: Multi-Scale Multi-Perceptual Mamba for Efficient Spectral Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mamba architecture has been widely applied to various low-level vision tasks due to its exceptional adaptability and strong performance. Although the Mamba architecture has been adopted for spectral reconstruction, it still faces the following two challenges: (1) Single spatial perception limits the ability to fully understand and analyze hyperspectral images; (2) Single-scale feature extraction struggles to capture the complex structures and fine details present in hyperspectral images. To address these issues, we propose a multi-scale, multi-perceptual Mamba architecture for the spectral reconstruction task, called M3SR. Specifically, we design a multi-perceptual fusion block to enhance the ability of the model to comprehensively understand and analyze the input features. By integrating the multi-perceptual fusion block into a U-Net structure, M3SR can effectively extract and fuse global, intermediate, and local features, thereby enabling accurate reconstruction of hyperspectral images at multiple scales. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed M3SR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods while incurring a lower computational cost.</description>

      <title>ReCo-KD: Region- and Context-Aware Knowledge Distillation for Efficient 3D Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate 3D medical image segmentation is vital for diagnosis and treatment planning, but state-of-the-art models are often too large for clinics with limited computing resources. Lightweight architectures typically suffer significant performance loss. To address these deployment and speed constraints, we propose Region- and Context-aware Knowledge Distillation (ReCo-KD), a training-only framework that transfers both fine-grained anatomical detail and long-range contextual information from a high-capacity teacher to a compact student network. The framework integrates Multi-Scale Structure-Aware Region Distillation (MS-SARD), which applies class-aware masks and scale-normalized weighting to emphasize small but clinically important regions, and Multi-Scale Context Alignment (MS-CA), which aligns teacher-student affinity patterns across feature levels. Implemented on nnU-Net in a backbone-agnostic manner, ReCo-KD requires no custom student design and is easily adapted to other architectures. Experiments on multiple public 3D medical segmentation datasets and a challenging aggregated dataset show that the distilled lightweight model attains accuracy close to the teacher while markedly reducing parameters and inference latency, underscoring its practicality for clinical deployment.</description>

      <title>SnapGen++: Unleashing Diffusion Transformers for Efficient High-Fidelity Image Generation on Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) have set new standards in image generation, yet remain impractical for on-device deployment due to their high computational and memory costs. In this work, we present an efficient DiT framework tailored for mobile and edge devices that achieves transformer-level generation quality under strict resource constraints. Our design combines three key components. First, we propose a compact DiT architecture with an adaptive global-local sparse attention mechanism that balances global context modeling and local detail preservation. Second, we propose an elastic training framework that jointly optimizes sub-DiTs of varying capacities within a unified supernetwork, allowing a single model to dynamically adjust for efficient inference across different hardware. Finally, we develop Knowledge-Guided Distribution Matching Distillation, a step-distillation pipeline that integrates the DMD objective with knowledge transfer from few-step teacher models, producing high-fidelity and low-latency generation (e.g., 4-step) suitable for real-time on-device use. Together, these contributions enable scalable, efficient, and high-quality diffusion models for deployment on diverse hardware.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Image Quality Assessment Ability of LMMs via Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently shown remarkable promise in low-level visual perception tasks, particularly in Image Quality Assessment (IQA), demonstrating strong zero-shot capability. However, achieving state-of-the-art performance often requires computationally expensive fine-tuning methods, which aim to align the distribution of quality-related token in output with image quality levels. Inspired by recent training-free works for LMM, we introduce IQARAG, a novel, training-free framework that enhances LMMs' IQA ability. IQARAG leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve some semantically similar but quality-variant reference images with corresponding Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) for input image. These retrieved images and input image are integrated into a specific prompt. Retrieved images provide the LMM with a visual perception anchor for IQA task. IQARAG contains three key phases: Retrieval Feature Extraction, Image Retrieval, and Integration &amp; Quality Score Generation. Extensive experiments across multiple diverse IQA datasets, including KADID, KonIQ, LIVE Challenge, and SPAQ, demonstrate that the proposed IQARAG effectively boosts the IQA performance of LMMs, offering a resource-efficient alternative to fine-tuning for quality assessment.</description>

      <title>YOLOBirDrone: Dataset for Bird vs Drone Detection and Classification and a YOLO based enhanced learning architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of aerial drones for commercial and defense applications has benefited in many ways and is therefore utilized in several different application domains. However, they are also increasingly used for targeted attacks, posing a significant safety challenge and necessitating the development of drone detection systems. Vision-based drone detection systems currently have an accuracy limitation and struggle to distinguish between drones and birds, particularly when the birds are small in size. This research work proposes a novel YOLOBirDrone architecture that improves the detection and classification accuracy of birds and drones. YOLOBirDrone has different components, including an adaptive and extended layer aggregation (AELAN), a multi-scale progressive dual attention module (MPDA), and a reverse MPDA (RMPDA) to preserve shape information and enrich features with local and global spatial and channel information. A large-scale dataset, BirDrone, is also introduced in this article, which includes small and challenging objects for robust aerial object identification. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement in performance metrics through the proposed YOLOBirDrone architecture compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms, with detection accuracy reaching approximately 85% across various scenarios.</description>

      <title>UM-Text: A Unified Multimodal Model for Image Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of image generation, visual text editing using natural language instructions has received increasing attention. The main challenge of this task is to fully understand the instruction and reference image, and thus generate visual text that is style-consistent with the image. Previous methods often involve complex steps of specifying the text content and attributes, such as font size, color, and layout, without considering the stylistic consistency with the reference image. To address this, we propose UM-Text, a unified multimodal model for context understanding and visual text editing by natural language instructions. Specifically, we introduce a Visual Language Model (VLM) to process the instruction and reference image, so that the text content and layout can be elaborately designed according to the context information. To generate an accurate and harmonious visual text image, we further propose the UM-Encoder to combine the embeddings of various condition information, where the combination is automatically configured by VLM according to the input instruction. During training, we propose a regional consistency loss to offer more effective supervision for glyph generation on both latent and RGB space, and design a tailored three-stage training strategy to further enhance model performance. In addition, we contribute the UM-DATA-200K, a large-scale visual text image dataset on diverse scenes for model training. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>IGAN: A New Inception-based Model for Stable and High-Fidelity Image Synthesis Using Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) face a significant challenge of striking an optimal balance between high-quality image generation and training stability. Recent techniques, such as DCGAN, BigGAN, and StyleGAN, improve visual fidelity; however, such techniques usually struggle with mode collapse and unstable gradients at high network depth. This paper proposes a novel GAN structural model that incorporates deeper inception-inspired convolution and dilated convolution. This novel model is termed the Inception Generative Adversarial Network (IGAN). The IGAN model generates high-quality synthetic images while maintaining training stability, by reducing mode collapse as well as preventing vanishing and exploding gradients. Our proposed IGAN model achieves the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 13.12 and 15.08 on the CUB-200 and ImageNet datasets, respectively, representing a 28-33% improvement in FID over the state-of-the-art GANs. Additionally, the IGAN model attains an Inception Score (IS) of 9.27 and 68.25, reflecting improved image diversity and generation quality. Finally, the two techniques of dropout and spectral normalization are utilized in both the generator and discriminator structures to further mitigate gradient explosion and overfitting. These findings confirm that the IGAN model potentially balances training stability with image generation quality, constituting a scalable and computationally efficient framework for high-fidelity image synthesis.</description>

      <title>Tissue Classification and Whole-Slide Images Analysis via Modeling of the Tumor Microenvironment and Biological Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic integration of whole slide images (WSIs) and gene expression profiles has demonstrated substantial potential in precision clinical diagnosis and cancer progression studies. However, most existing studies focus on individual gene sequences and slide level classification tasks, with limited attention to spatial transcriptomics and patch level applications. To address this limitation, we propose a multimodal network, BioMorphNet, which automatically integrates tissue morphological features and spatial gene expression to support tissue classification and differential gene analysis. For considering morphological features, BioMorphNet constructs a graph to model the relationships between target patches and their neighbors, and adjusts the response strength based on morphological and molecular level similarity, to better characterize the tumor microenvironment. In terms of multimodal interactions, BioMorphNet derives clinical pathway features from spatial transcriptomic data based on a predefined pathway database, serving as a bridge between tissue morphology and gene expression. In addition, a novel learnable pathway module is designed to automatically simulate the biological pathway formation process, providing a complementary representation to existing clinical pathways. Compared with the latest morphology gene multimodal methods, BioMorphNet's average classification metrics improve by 2.67%, 5.48%, and 6.29% for prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer datasets, respectively. BioMorphNet not only classifies tissue categories within WSIs accurately to support tumor localization, but also analyzes differential gene expression between tissue categories based on prediction confidence, contributing to the discovery of potential tumor biomarkers.</description>

      <title>From Local Windows to Adaptive Candidates via Individualized Exploratory: Rethinking Attention for Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is a fundamental computer vision task that aims to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) image from a low-resolution (LR) input. Transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable performance by modeling long-range dependencies in degraded images. However, their feature-intensive attention computation incurs high computational cost. To improve efficiency, most existing approaches partition images into fixed groups and restrict attention within each group. Such group-wise attention overlooks the inherent asymmetry in token similarities, thereby failing to enable flexible and token-adaptive attention computation. To address this limitation, we propose the Individualized Exploratory Transformer (IET), which introduces a novel Individualized Exploratory Attention (IEA) mechanism that allows each token to adaptively select its own content-aware and independent attention candidates. This token-adaptive and asymmetric design enables more precise information aggregation while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on standard SR benchmarks demonstrate that IET achieves state-of-the-art performance under comparable computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Semantic Misalignment in Vision-Language Models under Perceptual Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous driving and embodied AI systems, where reliable perception is critical for safe semantic reasoning and decision-making. While recent VLMs demonstrate strong performance on multimodal benchmarks, their robustness to realistic perception degradation remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically study semantic misalignment in VLMs under controlled degradation of upstream visual perception, using semantic segmentation on the Cityscapes dataset as a representative perception module. We introduce perception-realistic corruptions that induce only moderate drops in conventional segmentation metrics, yet observe severe failures in downstream VLM behavior, including hallucinated object mentions, omission of safety-critical entities, and inconsistent safety judgments. To quantify these effects, we propose a set of language-level misalignment metrics that capture hallucination, critical omission, and safety misinterpretation, and analyze their relationship with segmentation quality across multiple contrastive and generative VLMs. Our results reveal a clear disconnect between pixel-level robustness and multimodal semantic reliability, highlighting a critical limitation of current VLM-based systems and motivating the need for evaluation frameworks that explicitly account for perception uncertainty in safety-critical applications.</description>

      <title>Geo-NVS-w: Geometry-Aware Novel View Synthesis In-the-Wild with an SDF Renderer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Geo-NVS-w, a geometry-aware framework for high-fidelity novel view synthesis from unstructured, in-the-wild image collections. While existing in-the-wild methods already excel at novel view synthesis, they often lack geometric grounding on complex surfaces, sometimes producing results that contain inconsistencies. Geo-NVS-w addresses this limitation by leveraging an underlying geometric representation based on a Signed Distance Function (SDF) to guide the rendering process. This is complemented by a novel Geometry-Preservation Loss which ensures that fine structural details are preserved. Our framework achieves competitive rendering performance, while demonstrating a 4-5x reduction reduction in energy consumption compared to similar methods. We demonstrate that Geo-NVS-w is a robust method for in-the-wild NVS, yielding photorealistic results with sharp, geometrically coherent details.</description>

      <title>Source-Free Domain Adaptation for Geospatial Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D geospatial point clouds is pivotal for remote sensing applications. However, variations in geographic patterns across regions and data acquisition strategies induce significant domain shifts, severely degrading the performance of deployed models. Existing domain adaptation methods typically rely on access to source-domain data. However, this requirement is rarely met due to data privacy concerns, regulatory policies, and data transmission limitations. This motivates the largely underexplored setting of source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA), where only a pretrained model and unlabeled target-domain data are available. In this paper, we propose LoGo (Local-Global Dual-Consensus), a novel SFUDA framework specifically designed for geospatial point clouds. At the local level, we introduce a class-balanced prototype estimation module that abandons conventional global threshold filtering in favor of an intra-class independent anchor mining strategy. This ensures that robust feature prototypes can be generated even for sample-scarce tail classes, effectively mitigating the feature collapse caused by long-tailed distributions. At the global level, we introduce an optimal transport-based global distribution alignment module that formulates pseudo-label assignment as a global optimization problem. By enforcing global distribution constraints, this module effectively corrects the over-dominance of head classes inherent in local greedy assignments, preventing model predictions from being severely biased towards majority classes. Finally, we propose a dual-consistency pseudo-label filtering mechanism. This strategy retains only high-confidence pseudo-labels where local multi-augmented ensemble predictions align with global optimal transport assignments for self-training.</description>

      <title>Design and Development of a Low-Cost Scalable GSM-IoT Smart Pet Feeder with a Remote Mobile Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pet ownership is increasingly common in modern households, yet maintaining a consistent feeding schedule remains challenging for the owners particularly those who live in cities and have busy lifestyles. This paper presents the design, development, and validation of a low-cost, scalable GSM-IoT smart pet feeder that enables remote monitoring and control through cellular communication. The device combines with an Arduino microcontroller, a SIM800L GSM module for communication, an ultrasonic sensor for real-time food-level assessment, and a servo mechanism for accurate portion dispensing. A dedicated mobile application was developed using MIT App Inventor which allows owners to send feeding commands and receive real-time status updates. Experimental results demonstrate a 98\% SMS command success rate, consistent portion dispensing with $\pm 2.67$\% variance, and reliable autonomous operation. Its modular, energy-efficient design makes it easy to use in a wide range of households, including those with limited resources. This work pushes forward the field of accessible pet care technology by providing a practical, scalable, and completely internet-independent solution for personalized pet feeding. In doing so, it sets a new benchmark for low-cost, GSM-powered automation in smart pet products.</description>

Abstract: Objectives: To overcome challenges in diagnosing pericoronitis on panoramic radiographs, an AI-assisted assessment system integrating anatomical localization, pathological classification, and interpretability. Methods: A two-stage deep learning pipeline was implemented. The first stage used YOLOv8 to detect third molars and classify their anatomical positions and angulations based on Winter's classification. Detected regions were then fed into a second-stage classifier, a modified ResNet-50 architecture, for detecting radiographic features suggestive of pericoronitis. To enhance clinical trust, Grad-CAM was used to highlight key diagnostic regions on the radiographs. Results: The YOLOv8 component achieved 92% precision and 92.5% mean average precision. The ResNet-50 classifier yielded F1-scores of 88% for normal cases and 86% for pericoronitis. Radiologists reported 84% alignment between Grad-CAM and their diagnostic impressions, supporting the radiographic relevance of the interpretability output. Conclusion: The system shows strong potential for AI-assisted panoramic assessment, with explainable AI features that support clinical confidence.</description>

      <title>Edge-Optimized Multimodal Learning for UAV Video Understanding via BLIP-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for real-time visual understanding and interaction in complex scenarios is increasingly critical for unmanned aerial vehicles. However, a significant challenge arises from the contradiction between the high computational cost of large Vision language models and the limited computing resources available on UAV edge devices. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a lightweight multimodal task platform based on BLIP-2, integrated with YOLO-World and YOLOv8-Seg models. This integration extends the multi-task capabilities of BLIP-2 for UAV applications with minimal adaptation and without requiring task-specific fine-tuning on drone data. Firstly, the deep integration of BLIP-2 with YOLO models enables it to leverage the precise perceptual results of YOLO for fundamental tasks like object detection and instance segmentation, thereby facilitating deeper visual-attention understanding and reasoning. Secondly, a content-aware key frame sampling mechanism based on K-Means clustering is designed, which incorporates intelligent frame selection and temporal feature concatenation. This equips the lightweight BLIP-2 architecture with the capability to handle video-level interactive tasks effectively. Thirdly, a unified prompt optimization scheme for multi-task adaptation is implemented. This scheme strategically injects structured event logs from the YOLO models as contextual information into BLIP-2's input. Combined with output constraints designed to filter out technical details, this approach effectively guides the model to generate accurate and contextually relevant outputs for various tasks.</description>

      <title>SPARK: Scalable Real-Time Point Cloud Aggregation with Multi-View Self-Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time multi-camera 3D reconstruction is crucial for 3D perception, immersive interaction, and robotics. Existing methods struggle with multi-view fusion, camera extrinsic uncertainty, and scalability for large camera setups. We propose SPARK, a self-calibrating real-time multi-camera point cloud reconstruction framework that jointly handles point cloud fusion and extrinsic uncertainty. SPARK consists of: (1) a geometry-aware online extrinsic estimation module leveraging multi-view priors and enforcing cross-view and temporal consistency for stable self-calibration, and (2) a confidence-driven point cloud fusion strategy modeling depth reliability and visibility at pixel and point levels to suppress noise and view-dependent inconsistencies. By performing frame-wise fusion without accumulation, SPARK produces stable point clouds in dynamic scenes while scaling linearly with the number of cameras. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-camera systems show that SPARK outperforms existing approaches in extrinsic accuracy, geometric consistency, temporal stability, and real-time performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability for large-scale multi-camera 3D reconstruction.</description>

      <title>MMLGNet: Cross-Modal Alignment of Remote Sensing Data using CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal framework, Multimodal Language-Guided Network (MMLGNet), to align heterogeneous remote sensing modalities like Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) and LiDAR with natural language semantics using vision-language models such as CLIP. With the increasing availability of multimodal Earth observation data, there is a growing need for methods that effectively fuse spectral, spatial, and geometric information while enabling semantic-level understanding. MMLGNet employs modality-specific encoders and aligns visual features with handcrafted textual embeddings in a shared latent space via bi-directional contrastive learning. Inspired by CLIP's training paradigm, our approach bridges the gap between high-dimensional remote sensing data and language-guided interpretation. Notably, MMLGNet achieves strong performance with simple CNN-based encoders, outperforming several established multimodal visual-only methods on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating the significant benefit of language supervision. Codes are available at https://github.com/AdityaChaudhary2913/CLIP_HSI.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Facial Retargeting Using Local Patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of digital animation, the quest to produce lifelike facial animations for virtual characters has led to the development of various retargeting methods. While the retargeting facial motion between models of similar shapes has been very successful, challenges arise when the retargeting is performed on stylized or exaggerated 3D characters that deviate significantly from human facial structures. In this scenario, it is important to consider the target character's facial structure and possible range of motion to preserve the semantics assumed by the original facial motions after the retargeting. To achieve this, we propose a local patch-based retargeting method that transfers facial animations captured in a source performance video to a target stylized 3D character. Our method consists of three modules. The Automatic Patch Extraction Module extracts local patches from the source video frame. These patches are processed through the Reenactment Module to generate correspondingly re-enacted target local patches. The Weight Estimation Module calculates the animation parameters for the target character at every frame for the creation of a complete facial animation sequence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can successfully transfer the semantic meaning of source facial expressions to stylized characters with considerable variations in facial feature proportion.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing Cardiologist-Like Reasoning in MLLMs for Interpretable Echocardiographic Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Echocardiographic diagnosis is vital for cardiac screening yet remains challenging. Existing echocardiography foundation models do not effectively capture the relationships between quantitative measurements and clinical manifestations, whereas medical reasoning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) require costly construction of detailed reasoning paths and remain ineffective at directly incorporating such echocardiographic priors into their reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach comprising Cardiac Reasoning Template (CRT) and CardiacMind to enhance MLLM's echocardiographic reasoning by introducing cardiologist-like mindset. Specifically, CRT provides stepwise canonical diagnostic procedures for complex cardiac diseases to streamline reasoning path construction without the need for costly case-by-case verification. To incentivize reasoning MLLM under CRT, we develop CardiacMind, a new reinforcement learning scheme with three novel rewards: Procedural Quantity Reward (PQtR), Procedural Quality Reward (PQlR), and Echocardiographic Semantic Reward (ESR). PQtR promotes detailed reasoning; PQlR promotes integration of evidence across views and modalities, while ESR grounds stepwise descriptions in visual content. Our methods show a 48% improvement in multiview echocardiographic diagnosis for 15 complex cardiac diseases and a 5% improvement on CardiacNet-PAH over prior methods. The user study on our method's reasoning outputs shows 93.33% clinician agreement with cardiologist-like reasoning logic. Our code will be available.</description>

      <title>Noise-Adaptive Regularization for Robust Multi-Label Remote Sensing Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of reliable methods for multi-label classification (MLC) has become a prominent research direction in remote sensing (RS). As the scale of RS data continues to expand, annotation procedures increasingly rely on thematic products or crowdsourced procedures to reduce the cost of manual annotation. While cost-effective, these strategies often introduce multi-label noise in the form of partially incorrect annotations. In MLC, label noise arises as additive noise, subtractive noise, or a combination of both in the form of mixed noise. Previous work has largely overlooked this distinction and commonly treats noisy annotations as supervised signals, lacking mechanisms that explicitly adapt learning behavior to different noise types. To address this limitation, we propose NAR, a noise-adaptive regularization method that explicitly distinguishes between additive and subtractive noise within a semi-supervised learning framework. NAR employs a confidence-based label handling mechanism that dynamically retains label entries with high confidence, temporarily deactivates entries with moderate confidence, and corrects low confidence entries via flipping. This selective attenuation of supervision is integrated with early-learning regularization (ELR) to stabilize training and mitigate overfitting to corrupted labels. Experiments across additive, subtractive, and mixed noise scenarios demonstrate that NAR consistently improves robustness compared with existing methods. Performance improvements are most pronounced under subtractive and mixed noise, indicating that adaptive suppression and selective correction of noisy supervision provide an effective strategy for noise robust learning in RS MLC.</description>

      <title>Divide and Conquer: Static-Dynamic Collaboration for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to continuously recognize novel classes under limited data, which suffers from the key stability-plasticity dilemma: balancing the retention of old knowledge with the acquisition of new knowledge. To address this issue, we divide the task into two different stages and propose a framework termed Static-Dynamic Collaboration (SDC) to achieve a better trade-off between stability and plasticity. Specifically, our method divides the normal pipeline of FSCIL into Static Retaining Stage (SRS) and Dynamic Learning Stage (DLS), which harnesses old static and incremental dynamic class information, respectively. During SRS, we train an initial model with sufficient data in the base session and preserve the key part as static memory to retain fundamental old knowledge. During DLS, we introduce an extra dynamic projector jointly trained with the previous static memory. By employing both stages, our method achieves improved retention of old knowledge while continuously adapting to new classes. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks and a real-world application dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance against other competitors.</description>

      <title>Developing Predictive and Robust Radiomics Models for Chemotherapy Response in High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage with extensive peritoneal metastases, making treatment challenging. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is often used to reduce tumor burden before surgery, but about 40% of patients show limited response. Radiomics, combined with machine learning (ML), offers a promising non-invasive method for predicting NACT response by analyzing computed tomography (CT) imaging data. This study aimed to improve response prediction in HGSOC patients undergoing NACT by integration different feature selection methods. Materials and methods: A framework for selecting robust radiomics features was introduced by employing an automated randomisation algorithm to mimic inter-observer variability, ensuring a balance between feature robustness and prediction accuracy. Four response metrics were used: chemotherapy response score (CRS), RECIST, volume reduction (VolR), and diameter reduction (DiaR). Lesions in different anatomical sites were studied. Pre- and post-NACT CT scans were used for feature extraction and model training on one cohort, and an independent cohort was used for external testing. Results: The best prediction performance was achieved using all lesions combined for VolR prediction, with an AUC of 0.83. Omental lesions provided the best results for CRS prediction (AUC 0.77), while pelvic lesions performed best for DiaR (AUC 0.76). Conclusion: The integration of robustness into the feature selection processes ensures the development of reliable models and thus facilitates the implementation of the radiomics models in clinical applications for HGSOC patients. Future work should explore further applications of radiomics in ovarian cancer, particularly in real-time clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Modality-Decoupled RGB-Thermal Object Detector via Query Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advantage of RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) detection lies in its ability to perform modality fusion and integrate cross-modality complementary information, enabling robust detection under diverse illumination and weather conditions. However, under extreme conditions where one modality exhibits poor quality and disturbs detection, modality separation is necessary to mitigate the impact of noise. To address this problem, we propose a Modality-Decoupled RGB-T detection framework with Query Fusion (MDQF) to balance modality complementation and separation. In this framework, DETR-like detectors are employed as separate branches for the RGB and TIR images, with query fusion interspersed between the two branches in each refinement stage. Herein, query fusion is performed by feeding the high-quality queries from one branch to the other one after query selection and adaptation. This design effectively excludes the degraded modality and corrects the predictions using high-quality queries. Moreover, the decoupled framework allows us to optimize each individual branch with unpaired RGB or TIR images, eliminating the need for paired RGB-T data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach delivers superior performance to existing RGB-T detectors and achieves better modality independence.</description>

      <title>CoMa: Contextual Massing Generation with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conceptual design phase in architecture and urban planning, particularly building massing, is complex and heavily reliant on designer intuition and manual effort. To address this, we propose an automated framework for generating building massing based on functional requirements and site context. A primary obstacle to such data-driven methods has been the lack of suitable datasets. Consequently, we introduce the CoMa-20K dataset, a comprehensive collection that includes detailed massing geometries, associated economical and programmatic data, and visual representations of the development site within its existing urban context. We benchmark this dataset by formulating massing generation as a conditional task for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), evaluating both fine-tuned and large zero-shot models. Our experiments reveal the inherent complexity of the task while demonstrating the potential of VLMs to produce context-sensitive massing options. The dataset and analysis establish a foundational benchmark and highlight significant opportunities for future research in data-driven architectural design.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Distracted Driver Detection via Vision Language Models with Double Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distracted driving is a major cause of traffic collisions, calling for robust and scalable detection methods. Vision-language models (VLMs) enable strong zero-shot image classification, but existing VLM-based distracted driver detectors often underperform in real-world conditions. We identify subject-specific appearance variations (e.g., clothing, age, and gender) as a key bottleneck: VLMs entangle these factors with behavior cues, leading to decisions driven by who the driver is rather than what the driver is doing. To address this, we propose a subject decoupling framework that extracts a driver appearance embedding and removes its influence from the image embedding prior to zero-shot classification, thereby emphasizing distraction-relevant evidence. We further orthogonalize text embeddings via metric projection onto Stiefel manifold to improve separability while staying close to the original semantics. Experiments demonstrate consistent gains over prior baselines, indicating the promise of our approach for practical road-safety applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Safer Mobile Agents: Scalable Generation and Evaluation of Diverse Scenarios for VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous vehicles and mobile systems, making it crucial to evaluate their ability to support safer decision-making in complex environments. However, existing benchmarks inadequately cover diverse hazardous situations, especially anomalous scenarios with spatio-temporal dynamics. While image editing models are a promising means to synthesize such hazards, it remains challenging to generate well-formulated scenarios that include moving, intrusive, and distant objects frequently observed in the real world. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{HazardForge}, a scalable pipeline that leverages image editing models to generate these scenarios with layout decision algorithms, and validation modules. Using HazardForge, we construct \textbf{MovSafeBench}, a multiple-choice question (MCQ) benchmark comprising 7,254 images and corresponding QA pairs across 13 object categories, covering both normal and anomalous objects. Experiments using MovSafeBench show that VLM performance degrades notably under conditions including anomalous objects, with the largest drop in scenarios requiring nuanced motion understanding.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal Proxy Evolving for OOD Detection with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable zero-shot detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is critical for deploying vision-language models in open-world settings. However, the lack of labeled negatives in zero-shot OOD detection necessitates proxy signals that remain effective under distribution shift. Existing negative-label methods rely on a fixed set of textual proxies, which (i) sparsely sample the semantic space beyond in-distribution (ID) classes and (ii) remain static while only visual features drift, leading to cross-modal misalignment and unstable predictions. In this paper, we propose CoEvo, a training- and annotation-free test-time framework that performs bidirectional, sample-conditioned adaptation of both textual and visual proxies. Specifically, CoEvo introduces a proxy-aligned co-evolution mechanism to maintain two evolving proxy caches, which dynamically mines contextual textual negatives guided by test images and iteratively refines visual proxies, progressively realigning cross-modal similarities and enlarging local OOD margins. Finally, we dynamically re-weight the contributions of dual-modal proxies to obtain a calibrated OOD score that is robust to distribution shift. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoEvo achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC by 1.33% and reducing FPR95 by 45.98% on ImageNet-1K compared to strong negative-label baselines.</description>

      <title>An IoT-Enabled Smart Aquarium System for Real-Time Water Quality Monitoring and Automated Feeding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maintaining optimal water quality in aquariums is critical for aquatic health but remains challenging due to the need for continuous monitoring of multiple parameters. Traditional manual methods are inefficient, labor-intensive, and prone to human error, often leading to suboptimal aquatic conditions. This paper presents an IoT-based smart aquarium system that addresses these limitations by integrating an ESP32 microcontroller with multiple sensors (pH, TDS, temperature, turbidity) and actuators (servo feeder, water pump) for comprehensive real-time water quality monitoring and automated control. The system architecture incorporates edge processing capabilities, cloud connectivity via Blynk IoT platform, and an intelligent alert mechanism with configurable cooldown periods to prevent notification fatigue. Experimental evaluation in a 10-liter aquarium environment demonstrated the system's effectiveness, achieving 96\% average sensor accuracy and 1.2-second response time for anomaly detection. The automated feeding and water circulation modules maintained 97\% operational reliability throughout extended testing, significantly reducing manual intervention while ensuring stable aquatic conditions. This research demonstrates that cost-effective IoT solutions can revolutionize aquarium maintenance, making aquatic ecosystem management more accessible, reliable, and efficient for both residential and commercial applications.</description>

      <title>PKI: Prior Knowledge-Infused Neural Network for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to continually adapt a model on a limited number of new-class examples, facing two well-known challenges: catastrophic forgetting and overfitting to new classes. Existing methods tend to freeze more parts of network components and finetune others with an extra memory during incremental sessions. These methods emphasize preserving prior knowledge to ensure proficiency in recognizing old classes, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, constraining fewer parameters can help in overcoming overfitting with the assistance of prior knowledge. Following previous methods, we retain more prior knowledge and propose a prior knowledge-infused neural network (PKI) to facilitate FSCIL. PKI consists of a backbone, an ensemble of projectors, a classifier, and an extra memory. In each incremental session, we build a new projector and add it to the ensemble. Subsequently, we finetune the new projector and the classifier jointly with other frozen network components, ensuring the rich prior knowledge is utilized effectively. By cascading projectors, PKI integrates prior knowledge accumulated from previous sessions and learns new knowledge flexibly, which helps to recognize old classes and efficiently learn new classes. Further, to reduce the resource consumption associated with keeping many projectors, we design two variants of the prior knowledge-infused neural network (PKIV-1 and PKIV-2) to trade off a balance between resource consumption and performance by reducing the number of projectors. Extensive experiments on three popular benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>EfficientFSL: Enhancing Few-Shot Classification via Query-Only Tuning in Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large models such as Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable superiority over smaller architectures like ResNet in few-shot classification, owing to their powerful representational capacity. However, fine-tuning such large models demands extensive GPU memory and prolonged training time, making them impractical for many real-world low-resource scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose EfficientFSL, a query-only fine-tuning framework tailored specifically for few-shot classification with ViT, which achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. EfficientFSL fully leverages the knowledge embedded in the pre-trained model and its strong comprehension ability, achieving high classification accuracy with an extremely small number of tunable parameters. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight trainable Forward Block to synthesize task-specific queries that extract informative features from the intermediate representations of the pre-trained model in a query-only manner. We further propose a Combine Block to fuse multi-layer outputs, enhancing the depth and robustness of feature representations. Finally, a Support-Query Attention Block mitigates distribution shift by adjusting prototypes to align with the query set distribution. With minimal trainable parameters, EfficientFSL achieves state-of-the-art performance on four in-domain few-shot datasets and six cross-domain datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop LLM Discovery of Non-Standard Channel Priors in Vision Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel configuration search the optimization of layer specifications such as layer widths in deep neural networks presents a complex combinatorial challenge constrained by tensor shape compatibility and computational budgets. We posit that Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a transformative approach to Neural Architecture Search (NAS), capable of reasoning about architectural code structure in ways that traditional heuristics cannot. In this paper, we investigate the application of an LLM-driven NAS framework to the problem of channel configuration. We formulate the search as a sequence of conditional code generation tasks, where an LLM refines architectural specifications based on performance telemetry. Crucially, we address the data scarcity problem by generating a vast corpus of valid, shape-consistent architectures via Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) mutations. While these mutated networks are not necessarily high-performing, they provide the critical volume of structural data required for the LLM to learn the latent relationship between channel configurations and model performance. This allows the LLM to internalize complex design patterns and apply them to optimize feature extraction strategies. Experimental results on CIFAR-100 validate the efficacy of this approach, demonstrating that the model yields statistically significant improvements in accuracy. Our analysis confirms that the LLM successfully acquires domain-specific architectural priors, distinguishing this method from random search and highlighting the immense potential of language-driven design in deep learning.</description>

      <title>CD^2: Constrained Dataset Distillation for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) receives significant attention from the public to perform classification continuously with a few training samples, which suffers from the key catastrophic forgetting problem. Existing methods usually employ an external memory to store previous knowledge and treat it with incremental classes equally, which cannot properly preserve previous essential knowledge. To solve this problem and inspired by recent distillation works on knowledge transfer, we propose a framework termed \textbf{C}onstrained \textbf{D}ataset \textbf{D}istillation (\textbf{CD$^2$}) to facilitate FSCIL, which includes a dataset distillation module (\textbf{DDM}) and a distillation constraint module~(\textbf{DCM}). Specifically, the DDM synthesizes highly condensed samples guided by the classifier, forcing the model to learn compacted essential class-related clues from a few incremental samples. The DCM introduces a designed loss to constrain the previously learned class distribution, which can preserve distilled knowledge more sufficiently. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show the superiority of our method against other state-of-the-art competitors.</description>

      <title>VideoHEDGE: Entropy-Based Hallucination Detection for Video-VLMs via Semantic Clustering and Spatiotemporal Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucinations in video-capable vision-language models (Video-VLMs) remain frequent and high-confidence, while existing uncertainty metrics often fail to align with correctness. We introduce VideoHEDGE, a modular framework for hallucination detection in video question answering that extends entropy-based reliability estimation from images to temporally structured inputs. Given a video-question pair, VideoHEDGE draws a baseline answer and multiple high-temperature generations from both clean clips and photometrically and spatiotemporally perturbed variants, then clusters the resulting textual outputs into semantic hypotheses using either Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based or embedding-based methods. Cluster-level probability masses yield three reliability scores: Semantic Entropy (SE), RadFlag, and Vision-Amplified Semantic Entropy (VASE). We evaluate VideoHEDGE on the SoccerChat benchmark using an LLM-as-a-judge to obtain binary hallucination labels. Across three 7B Video-VLMs (Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL, and a SoccerChat-finetuned model), VASE consistently achieves the highest ROC-AUC, especially at larger distortion budgets, while SE and RadFlag often operate near chance. We further show that embedding-based clustering matches NLI-based clustering in detection performance at substantially lower computational cost, and that domain fine-tuning reduces hallucination frequency but yields only modest improvements in calibration. The hedge-bench PyPI library enables reproducible and extensible benchmarking, with full code and experimental resources available at https://github.com/Simula/HEDGE#videohedge .</description>

      <title>REVNET: Rotation-Equivariant Point Cloud Completion via Vector Neuron Anchor Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incomplete point clouds captured by 3D sensors often result in the loss of both geometric and semantic information. Most existing point cloud completion methods are built on rotation-variant frameworks trained with data in canonical poses, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. While data augmentation with random rotations can partially mitigate this issue, it significantly increases the learning burden and still fails to guarantee robust performance under arbitrary poses. To address this challenge, we propose the Rotation-Equivariant Anchor Transformer (REVNET), a novel framework built upon the Vector Neuron (VN) network for robust point cloud completion under arbitrary rotations. To preserve local details, we represent partial point clouds as sets of equivariant anchors and design a VN Missing Anchor Transformer to predict the positions and features of missing anchors. Furthermore, we extend VN networks with a rotation-equivariant bias formulation and a ZCA-based layer normalization to improve feature expressiveness. Leveraging the flexible conversion between equivariant and invariant VN features, our model can generate point coordinates with greater stability. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the synthetic MVP dataset in the equivariant setting. On the real-world KITTI dataset, REVNET delivers competitive results compared to non-equivariant networks, without requiring input pose alignment. The source code will be released on GitHub under URL: https://github.com/nizhf/REVNET.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Video Character Replacement without Structural Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controllable video character replacement with a user-provided identity remains a challenging problem due to the lack of paired video data. Prior works have predominantly relied on a reconstruction-based paradigm that requires per-frame segmentation masks and explicit structural guidance (e.g., skeleton, depth). This reliance, however, severely limits their generalizability in complex scenarios involving occlusions, character-object interactions, unusual poses, or challenging illumination, often leading to visual artifacts and temporal inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose MoCha, a pioneering framework that bypasses these limitations by requiring only a single arbitrary frame mask. To effectively adapt the multi-modal input condition and enhance facial identity, we introduce a condition-aware RoPE and employ an RL-based post-training stage. Furthermore, to overcome the scarcity of qualified paired-training data, we propose a comprehensive data construction pipeline. Specifically, we design three specialized datasets: a high-fidelity rendered dataset built with Unreal Engine 5 (UE5), an expression-driven dataset synthesized by current portrait animation techniques, and an augmented dataset derived from existing video-mask pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. We will release the code to facilitate further research.

      <title>WaveFormer: Frequency-Time Decoupled Vision Modeling with Wave Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision modeling has advanced rapidly with Transformers, whose attention mechanisms capture visual dependencies but lack a principled account of how semantic information propagates spatially. We revisit this problem from a wave-based perspective: feature maps are treated as spatial signals whose evolution over an internal propagation time (aligned with network depth) is governed by an underdamped wave equation. In this formulation, spatial frequency-from low-frequency global layout to high-frequency edges and textures-is modeled explicitly, and its interaction with propagation time is controlled rather than implicitly fixed. We derive a closed-form, frequency-time decoupled solution and implement it as the Wave Propagation Operator (WPO), a lightweight module that models global interactions in O(N log N) time-far lower than attention. Building on WPO, we propose a family of WaveFormer models as drop-in replacements for standard ViTs and CNNs, achieving competitive accuracy across image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, while delivering up to 1.6x higher throughput and 30% fewer FLOPs than attention-based alternatives. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that wave propagation introduces a complementary modeling bias to heat-based methods, effectively capturing both global coherence and high-frequency details essential for rich visual semantics.

      <title>Interpretability and Individuality in Knee MRI: Patient-Specific Radiomic Fingerprint with Reconstructed Healthy Personas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For automated assessment of knee MRI scans, both accuracy and interpretability are essential for clinical use and adoption. Traditional radiomics rely on predefined features chosen at the population level; while more interpretable, they are often too restrictive to capture patient-specific variability and can underperform end-to-end deep learning (DL). To address this, we propose two complementary strategies that bring individuality and interpretability: radiomic fingerprints and healthy personas. First, a radiomic fingerprint is a dynamically constructed, patient-specific feature set derived from MRI. Instead of applying a uniform population-level signature, our model predicts feature relevance from a pool of candidate features and selects only those most predictive for each patient, while maintaining feature-level interpretability. This fingerprint can be viewed as a latent-variable model of feature usage, where an image-conditioned predictor estimates usage probabilities and a transparent logistic regression with global coefficients performs classification. Second, a healthy persona synthesises a pathology-free baseline for each patient using a diffusion model trained to reconstruct healthy knee MRIs. Comparing features extracted from pathological images against their personas highlights deviations from normal anatomy, enabling intuitive, case-specific explanations of disease manifestations. We systematically compare fingerprints, personas, and their combination across three clinical tasks. Experimental results show that both approaches yield performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art DL models, while supporting interpretability at multiple levels. Case studies further illustrate how these perspectives facilitate human-explainable biomarker discovery and pathology localisation.</description>

      <title>SfMamba: Efficient Source-Free Domain Adaptation via Selective Scan Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) tackles the critical challenge of adapting source-pretrained models to unlabeled target domains without access to source data, overcoming data privacy and storage limitations in real-world applications. However, existing SFDA approaches struggle with the trade-off between perception field and computational efficiency in domain-invariant feature learning. Recently, Mamba has offered a promising solution through its selective scan mechanism, which enables long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity. However, the Visual Mamba (i.e., VMamba) remains limited in capturing channel-wise frequency characteristics critical for domain alignment and maintaining spatial robustness under significant domain shifts. To address these, we propose a framework called SfMamba to fully explore the stable dependency in source-free model transfer. SfMamba introduces Channel-wise Visual State-Space block that enables channel-sequence scanning for domain-invariant feature extraction. In addition, SfMamba involves a Semantic-Consistent Shuffle strategy that disrupts background patch sequences in 2D selective scan while preserving prediction consistency to mitigate error accumulation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks show that SfMamba achieves consistently stronger performance than existing methods while maintaining favorable parameter efficiency, offering a practical solution for SFDA. Our code is available at https://github.com/chenxi52/SfMamba.</description>

      <title>SoC: Semantic Orthogonal Calibration for Test-Time Prompt Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing adoption of vision-language models (VLMs) in critical decision-making systems such as healthcare or autonomous driving, the calibration of their uncertainty estimates becomes paramount. Yet, this dimension has been largely underexplored in the VLM test-time prompt-tuning (TPT) literature, which has predominantly focused on improving their discriminative performance. Recent state-of-the-art advocates for enforcing full orthogonality over pairs of text prompt embeddings to enhance separability, and therefore calibration. Nevertheless, as we theoretically show in this work, the inherent gradients from fully orthogonal constraints will strongly push semantically related classes away, ultimately making the model overconfident. Based on our findings, we propose Semantic Orthogonal Calibration (SoC), a Huber-based regularizer that enforces smooth prototype separation while preserving semantic proximity, thereby improving calibration compared to prior orthogonality-based approaches. Across a comprehensive empirical validation, we demonstrate that SoC consistently improves calibration performance, while also maintaining competitive discriminative capabilities.</description>

      <title>CtrlFuse: Mask-Prompt Guided Controllable Infrared and Visible Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion generates all-weather perception-capable images by combining complementary modalities, enhancing environmental awareness for intelligent unmanned systems. Existing methods either focus on pixel-level fusion while overlooking downstream task adaptability or implicitly learn rigid semantics through cascaded detection/segmentation models, unable to interactively address diverse semantic target perception needs. We propose CtrlFuse, a controllable image fusion framework that enables interactive dynamic fusion guided by mask prompts. The model integrates a multi-modal feature extractor, a reference prompt encoder (RPE), and a prompt-semantic fusion module (PSFM). The RPE dynamically encodes task-specific semantic prompts by fine-tuning pre-trained segmentation models with input mask guidance, while the PSFM explicitly injects these semantics into fusion features. Through synergistic optimization of parallel segmentation and fusion branches, our method achieves mutual enhancement between task performance and fusion quality. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results in both fusion controllability and segmentation accuracy, with the adapted task branch even outperforming the original segmentation model.</description>

      <title>SafeRedir: Prompt Embedding Redirection for Robust Unlearning in Image Generation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image generation models (IGMs), while capable of producing impressive and creative content, often memorize a wide range of undesirable concepts from their training data, leading to the reproduction of unsafe content such as NSFW imagery and copyrighted artistic styles. Such behaviors pose persistent safety and compliance risks in real-world deployments and cannot be reliably mitigated by post-hoc filtering, owing to the limited robustness of such mechanisms and a lack of fine-grained semantic control. Recent unlearning methods seek to erase harmful concepts at the model level, which exhibit the limitations of requiring costly retraining, degrading the quality of benign generations, or failing to withstand prompt paraphrasing and adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, we introduce SafeRedir, a lightweight inference-time framework for robust unlearning via prompt embedding redirection. Without modifying the underlying IGMs, SafeRedir adaptively routes unsafe prompts toward safe semantic regions through token-level interventions in the embedding space. The framework comprises two core components: a latent-aware multi-modal safety classifier for identifying unsafe generation trajectories, and a token-level delta generator for precise semantic redirection, equipped with auxiliary predictors for token masking and adaptive scaling to localize and regulate the intervention. Empirical results across multiple representative unlearning tasks demonstrate that SafeRedir achieves effective unlearning capability, high semantic and perceptual preservation, robust image quality, and enhanced resistance to adversarial attacks. Furthermore, SafeRedir generalizes effectively across a variety of diffusion backbones and existing unlearned models, validating its plug-and-play compatibility and broad applicability. Code and data are available at https://github.com/ryliu68/SafeRedir.</description>

      <title>Al\'em do Desempenho: Um Estudo da Confiabilidade de Detectores de Deepfakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deepfakes are synthetic media generated by artificial intelligence, with positive applications in education and creativity, but also serious negative impacts such as fraud, misinformation, and privacy violations. Although detection techniques have advanced, comprehensive evaluation methods that go beyond classification performance remain lacking. This paper proposes a reliability assessment framework based on four pillars: transferability, robustness, interpretability, and computational efficiency. An analysis of five state-of-the-art methods revealed significant progress as well as critical limitations.</description>

      <title>Salience-SGG: Enhancing Unbiased Scene Graph Generation with Iterative Salience Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) suffers from a long-tailed distribution, where a few predicate classes dominate while many others are underrepresented, leading to biased models that underperform on rare relations. Unbiased-SGG methods address this issue by implementing debiasing strategies, but often at the cost of spatial understanding, resulting in an over-reliance on semantic priors. We introduce Salience-SGG, a novel framework featuring an Iterative Salience Decoder (ISD) that emphasizes triplets with salient spatial structures. To support this, we propose semantic-agnostic salience labels guiding ISD. Evaluations on Visual Genome, Open Images V6, and GQA-200 show that Salience-SGG achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves existing Unbiased-SGG methods in their spatial understanding as demonstrated by the Pairwise Localization Average Precision</description>

      <title>ISLA: A U-Net for MRI-based acute ischemic stroke lesion segmentation with deep supervision, attention, domain adaptation, and ensemble learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate delineation of acute ischemic stroke lesions in MRI is a key component of stroke diagnosis and management. In recent years, deep learning models have been successfully applied to the automatic segmentation of such lesions. While most proposed architectures are based on the U-Net framework, they primarily differ in their choice of loss functions and in the use of deep supervision, residual connections, and attention mechanisms. Moreover, many implementations are not publicly available, and the optimal configuration for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) lesion segmentation remains unclear. In this work, we introduce ISLA (Ischemic Stroke Lesion Analyzer), a new deep learning model for AIS lesion segmentation from diffusion MRI, trained on three multicenter databases totaling more than 1500 AIS participants. Through systematic optimization of the loss function, convolutional architecture, deep supervision, and attention mechanisms, we developed a robust segmentation framework. We further investigated unsupervised domain adaptation to improve generalization to an external clinical dataset. ISLA outperformed two state-of-the-art approaches for AIS lesion segmentation on an external test set. Codes and trained models will be made publicly available to facilitate reuse and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>UR-Bench: A Benchmark for Multi-Hop Reasoning over Ultra-High-Resolution Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong capabilities in visual-language reasoning, yet their performance on ultra-high-resolution imagery remains largely unexplored. Existing visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks typically rely on medium-resolution data, offering limited visual complexity. To bridge this gap, we introduce Ultra-high-resolution Reasoning Benchmark (UR-Bench), a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs under extreme visual information. UR-Bench comprises two major categories, Humanistic Scenes and Natural Scenes, covering four subsets of ultra-high-resolution images with distinct spatial structures and data sources. Each subset contains images ranging from hundreds of megapixels to gigapixels, accompanied by questions organized into three levels, enabling evaluation of models' reasoning capabilities in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. We further propose an agent-based framework in which a language model performs reasoning by invoking external visual tools. In addition, we introduce Semantic Abstraction and Retrieval tools that enable more efficient processing of ultra-high-resolution images. We evaluate state-of-the-art models using both an end-to-end MLLMs and our agent-based framework, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.</description>

      <title>Translating Light-Sheet Microscopy Images to Virtual H&amp;E Using CycleGAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Histopathology analysis relies on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining, but fluorescence microscopy offers complementary information. Converting fluorescence images to H&amp;E-like appearance can aid interpretation and integration with standard workflows. We present a Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) approach for unpaired image-to-image translation from multi-channel fluorescence microscopy to pseudo H&amp;E stained histopathology images. The method combines C01 and C02 fluorescence channels into RGB and learns a bidirectional mapping between fluorescence and H&amp;E domains without paired training data. The architecture uses ResNet-based generators with residual blocks and PatchGAN discriminators, trained with adversarial, cycle-consistency, and identity losses. Experiments on fluorescence microscopy datasets show the model generates realistic pseudo H&amp;E images that preserve morphological structures while adopting H&amp;E-like color characteristics. This enables visualization of fluorescence data in a format familiar to pathologists and supports integration with existing H&amp;E-based analysis pipelines.</description>

      <title>Aggregating Diverse Cue Experts for AI-Generated Image Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid emergence of image synthesis models poses challenges to the generalization of AI-generated image detectors. However, existing methods often rely on model-specific features, leading to overfitting and poor generalization. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Cue Aggregation Network (MCAN), a novel framework that integrates different yet complementary cues in a unified network. MCAN employs a mixture-of-encoders adapter to dynamically process these cues, enabling more adaptive and robust feature representation. Our cues include the input image itself, which represents the overall content, and high-frequency components that emphasize edge details. Additionally, we introduce a Chromatic Inconsistency (CI) cue, which normalizes intensity values and captures noise information introduced during the image acquisition process in real images, making these noise patterns more distinguishable from those in AI-generated content. Unlike prior methods, MCAN's novelty lies in its unified multi-cue aggregation framework, which integrates spatial, frequency-domain, and chromaticity-based information for enhanced representation learning. These cues are intrinsically more indicative of real images, enhancing cross-model generalization. Extensive experiments on the GenImage, Chameleon, and UniversalFakeDetect benchmark validate the state-of-the-art performance of MCAN. In the GenImage dataset, MCAN outperforms the best state-of-the-art method by up to 7.4% in average ACC across eight different image generators.</description>

      <title>DentalX: Context-Aware Dental Disease Detection with Radiographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagnosing dental diseases from radiographs is time-consuming and challenging due to the subtle nature of diagnostic evidence. Existing methods, which rely on object detection models designed for natural images with more distinct target patterns, struggle to detect dental diseases that present with far less visual support. To address this challenge, we propose {\bf DentalX}, a novel context-aware dental disease detection approach that leverages oral structure information to mitigate the visual ambiguity inherent in radiographs. Specifically, we introduce a structural context extraction module that learns an auxiliary task: semantic segmentation of dental anatomy. The module extracts meaningful structural context and integrates it into the primary disease detection task to enhance the detection of subtle dental diseases. Extensive experiments on a dedicated benchmark demonstrate that DentalX significantly outperforms prior methods in both tasks. This mutual benefit arises naturally during model optimization, as the correlation between the two tasks is effectively captured. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhiqin1998/DentYOLOX.</description>

      <title>Near-perfect photo-ID of the Hula painted frog with zero-shot deep local-feature matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate individual identification is essential for monitoring rare amphibians, yet invasive marking is often unsuitable for critically endangered species. We evaluate state-of-the-art computer-vision methods for photographic re-identification of the Hula painted frog (Latonia nigriventer) using 1,233 ventral images from 191 individuals collected during 2013-2020 capture-recapture surveys. We compare deep local-feature matching in a zero-shot setting with deep global-feature embedding models. The local-feature pipeline achieves 98% top-1 closed-set identification accuracy, outperforming all global-feature models; fine-tuning improves the best global-feature model to 60% top-1 (91% top-10) but remains below local matching. To combine scalability with accuracy, we implement a two-stage workflow in which a fine-tuned global-feature model retrieves a short candidate list that is re-ranked by local-feature matching, reducing end-to-end runtime from 6.5-7.8 hours to ~38 minutes while maintaining ~96% top-1 closed-set accuracy on the labeled dataset. Separation of match scores between same- and different-individual pairs supports thresholding for open-set identification, enabling practical handling of novel individuals. We deploy this pipeline as a web application for routine field use, providing rapid, standardized, non-invasive identification to support conservation monitoring and capture-recapture analyses. Overall, in this species, zero-shot deep local-feature matching outperformed global-feature embedding and provides a strong default for photo-identification.</description>

      <title>S3-CLIP: Video Super Resolution for Person-ReID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracklet quality is often treated as an afterthought in most person re-identification (ReID) methods, with the majority of research presenting architectural modifications to foundational models. Such approaches neglect an important limitation, posing challenges when deploying ReID systems in real-world, difficult scenarios. In this paper, we introduce S3-CLIP, a video super-resolution-based CLIP-ReID framework developed for the VReID-XFD challenge at WACV 2026. The proposed method integrates recent advances in super-resolution networks with task-driven super-resolution pipelines, adapting them to the video-based person re-identification setting. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first systematic investigation of video super-resolution as a means of enhancing tracklet quality for person ReID, particularly under challenging cross-view conditions. Experimental results demonstrate performance competitive with the baseline, achieving 37.52% mAP in aerial-to-ground and 29.16% mAP in ground-to-aerial scenarios. In the ground-to-aerial setting, S3-CLIP achieves substantial gains in ranking accuracy, improving Rank-1, Rank-5, and Rank-10 performance by 11.24%, 13.48%, and 17.98%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Matters for 3D Visual Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent development of Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning ability has driven research in various domains such as mathematics, coding, and scientific discovery. Meanwhile, 3D visual grounding, as a fundamental task in 3D understanding, still remains challenging due to the limited reasoning ability of recent 3D visual grounding models. Most of the current methods incorporate a text encoder and visual feature encoder to generate cross-modal fuse features and predict the referring object. These models often require supervised training on extensive 3D annotation data. On the other hand, recent research also focus on scaling synthetic data to train stronger 3D visual grounding LLM, however, the performance gain remains limited and non-proportional to the data collection cost. In this work, we propose a 3D visual grounding data pipeline, which is capable of automatically synthesizing 3D visual grounding data along with corresponding reasoning process. Additionally, we leverage the generated data for LLM fine-tuning and introduce Reason3DVG-8B, a strong 3D visual grounding LLM that outperforms previous LLM-based method 3D-GRAND using only 1.6% of their training data, demonstrating the effectiveness of our data and the importance of reasoning in 3D visual grounding.</description>

      <title>Motion Attribution for Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of video generation models, the role of data in influencing motion is poorly understood. We present Motive (MOTIon attribution for Video gEneration), a motion-centric, gradient-based data attribution framework that scales to modern, large, high-quality video datasets and models. We use this to study which fine-tuning clips improve or degrade temporal dynamics. Motive isolates temporal dynamics from static appearance via motion-weighted loss masks, yielding efficient and scalable motion-specific influence computation. On text-to-video models, Motive identifies clips that strongly affect motion and guides data curation that improves temporal consistency and physical plausibility. With Motive-selected high-influence data, our method improves both motion smoothness and dynamic degree on VBench, achieving a 74.1% human preference win rate compared with the pretrained base model. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to attribute motion rather than visual appearance in video generative models and to use it to curate fine-tuning data.</description>

      <title>3AM: Segment Anything with Geometric Consistency in Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video object segmentation methods like SAM2 achieve strong performance through memory-based architectures but struggle under large viewpoint changes due to reliance on appearance features. Traditional 3D instance segmentation methods address viewpoint consistency but require camera poses, depth maps, and expensive preprocessing. We introduce 3AM, a training-time enhancement that integrates 3D-aware features from MUSt3R into SAM2. Our lightweight Feature Merger fuses multi-level MUSt3R features that encode implicit geometric correspondence. Combined with SAM2's appearance features, the model achieves geometry-consistent recognition grounded in both spatial position and visual similarity. We propose a field-of-view aware sampling strategy ensuring frames observe spatially consistent object regions for reliable 3D correspondence learning. Critically, our method requires only RGB input at inference, with no camera poses or preprocessing. On challenging datasets with wide-baseline motion (ScanNet++, Replica), 3AM substantially outperforms SAM2 and extensions, achieving 90.6% IoU and 71.7% Positive IoU on ScanNet++'s Selected Subset, improving over state-of-the-art VOS methods by +15.9 and +30.4 points.

      <title>RAVEN: Erasing Invisible Watermarks via Novel View Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Invisible watermarking has become a critical mechanism for authenticating AI-generated image content, with major platforms deploying watermarking schemes at scale. However, evaluating the vulnerability of these schemes against sophisticated removal attacks remains essential to assess their reliability and guide robust design. In this work, we expose a fundamental vulnerability in invisible watermarks by reformulating watermark removal as a view synthesis problem. Our key insight is that generating a perceptually consistent alternative view of the same semantic content, akin to re-observing a scene from a shifted perspective, naturally removes the embedded watermark while preserving visual fidelity. This reveals a critical gap: watermarks robust to pixel-space and frequency-domain attacks remain vulnerable to semantic-preserving viewpoint transformations. We introduce a zero-shot diffusion-based framework that applies controlled geometric transformations in latent space, augmented with view-guided correspondence attention to maintain structural consistency during reconstruction. Operating on frozen pre-trained models without detector access or watermark knowledge, our method achieves state-of-the-art watermark suppression across 15 watermarking methods--outperforming 14 baseline attacks while maintaining superior perceptual quality across multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>MLLM-VADStory: Domain Knowledge-Driven Multimodal LLMs for Video Ad Storyline Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose MLLM-VADStory, a novel domain knowledge-guided multimodal large language models (MLLM) framework to systematically quantify and generate insights for video ad storyline understanding at scale. The framework is centered on the core idea that ad narratives are structured by functional intent, with each scene unit performing a distinct communicative function, delivering product and brand-oriented information within seconds. MLLM-VADStory segments ads into functional units, classifies each unit's functionality using a novel advertising-specific functional role taxonomy, and then aggregates functional sequences across ads to recover data-driven storyline structures. Applying the framework to 50k social media video ads across four industry subverticals, we find that story-based creatives improve video retention, and we recommend top-performing story arcs to guide advertisers in creative design. Our framework demonstrates the value of using domain knowledge to guide MLLMs in generating scalable insights for video ad storylines, making it a versatile tool for understanding video creatives in general.</description>

      <title>HOSC: A Periodic Activation with Saturation Control for High-Fidelity Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic activations such as sine preserve high-frequency information in implicit neural representations (INRs) through their oscillatory structure, but often suffer from gradient instability and limited control over multi-scale behavior. We introduce the Hyperbolic Oscillator with Saturation Control (HOSC) activation, $\text{HOSC}(x) = \tanh\bigl(\beta \sin(\omega_0 x)\bigr)$, which exposes an explicit parameter $\beta$ that controls the Lipschitz bound of the activation by $\beta \omega_0$. This provides a direct mechanism to tune gradient magnitudes while retaining a periodic carrier. We provide a mathematical analysis and conduct a comprehensive empirical study across images, audio, video, NeRFs, and SDFs using standardized training protocols. Comparative analysis against SIREN, FINER, and related methods shows where HOSC provides substantial benefits and where it achieves competitive parity. Results establish HOSC as a practical periodic activation for INR applications, with domain-specific guidance on hyperparameter selection.

      <title>Imaging-anchored Multiomics in Cardiovascular Disease: Integrating Cardiac Imaging, Bulk, Single-cell, and Spatial Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiovascular disease arises from interactions between inherited risk, molecular programmes, and tissue-scale remodelling that are observed clinically through imaging. Health systems now routinely generate large volumes of cardiac MRI, CT and echocardiography together with bulk, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, yet these data are still analysed in separate pipelines. This review examines joint representations that link cardiac imaging phenotypes to transcriptomic and spatially resolved molecular states. An imaging-anchored perspective is adopted in which echocardiography, cardiac MRI and CT define a spatial phenotype of the heart, and bulk, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics provide cell-type- and location-specific molecular context. The biological and technical characteristics of these modalities are first summarised, and representation-learning strategies for each are outlined. Multimodal fusion approaches are reviewed, with emphasis on handling missing data, limited sample size, and batch effects. Finally, integrative pipelines for radiogenomics, spatial molecular alignment, and image-based prediction of gene expression are discussed, together with common failure modes, practical considerations, and open challenges. Spatial multiomics of human myocardium and atherosclerotic plaque, single-cell and spatial foundation models, and multimodal medical foundation models are collectively bringing imaging-anchored multiomics closer to large-scale cardiovascular translation.</description>

      <title>Application of Ideal Observer for Thresholded Data in Search Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study advances task-based image quality assessment by developing an anthropomorphic thresholded visual-search model observer. The model is an ideal observer for thresholded data inspired by the human visual system, allowing selective processing of high-salience features to improve discrimination performance. By filtering out irrelevant variability, the model enhances diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency.
  The observer employs a two-stage framework: candidate selection and decision-making. Using thresholded data during candidate selection refines regions of interest, while stage-specific feature processing optimizes performance. Simulations were conducted to evaluate the effects of thresholding on feature maps, candidate localization, and multi-feature scenarios. Results demonstrate that thresholding improves observer performance by excluding low-salience features, particularly in noisy environments. Intermediate thresholds often outperform no thresholding, indicating that retaining only relevant features is more effective than keeping all features.
  Additionally, the model demonstrates effective training with fewer images while maintaining alignment with human performance. These findings suggest that the proposed novel framework can predict human visual search performance in clinically realistic tasks and provide solutions for model observer training with limited resources. Our novel approach has applications in other areas where human visual search and detection tasks are modeled such as in computer vision, machine learning, defense and security image analysis.</description>

      <title>VULCA-Bench: A Multicultural Vision-Language Benchmark for Evaluating Cultural Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce VULCA-Bench, a multicultural art-critique benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models' (VLMs) cultural understanding beyond surface-level visual perception. Existing VLM benchmarks predominantly measure L1-L2 capabilities (object recognition, scene description, and factual question answering) while under-evaluate higher-order cultural interpretation. VULCA-Bench contains 7,410 matched image-critique pairs spanning eight cultural traditions, with Chinese-English bilingual coverage. We operationalise cultural understanding using a five-layer framework (L1-L5, from Visual Perception to Philosophical Aesthetics), instantiated as 225 culture-specific dimensions and supported by expert-written bilingual critiques. Our pilot results indicate that higher-layer reasoning (L3-L5) is consistently more challenging than visual and technical analysis (L1-L2). The dataset, evaluation scripts, and annotation tools are available under CC BY 4.0 in the supplementary materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tear film (TF) breakup is a key driver of understanding dry eye disease, yet estimating TF thickness and osmolarity from fluorescence (FL) imaging typically requires solving computationally expensive inverse problems. We propose an operator learning framework that replaces traditional inverse solvers with neural operators trained on simulated TF dynamics. This approach offers a scalable path toward rapid, data-driven analysis of tear film dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fiducial Exoskeletons: Image-Centric Robot State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Fiducial Exoskeletons, an image-based reformulation of 3D robot state estimation that replaces cumbersome procedures and motor-centric pipelines with single-image inference. Traditional approaches - especially robot-camera extrinsic estimation - often rely on high-precision actuators and require time-consuming routines such as hand-eye calibration. In contrast, modern learning-based robot control is increasingly trained and deployed from RGB observations on lower-cost hardware.
  Our key insight is twofold. First, we cast robot state estimation as 6D pose estimation of each link from a single RGB image: the robot-camera base transform is obtained directly as the estimated base-link pose, and the joint state is recovered via a lightweight global optimization that enforces kinematic consistency with the observed link poses (optionally warm-started with encoder readings). Second, we make per-link 6D pose estimation robust and simple - even without learning - by introducing the fiducial exoskeleton: a lightweight 3D-printed mount with a fiducial marker on each link and known marker-link geometry.
  This design yields robust camera-robot extrinsics, per-link SE(3) poses, and joint-angle state from a single image, enabling robust state estimation even on unplugged robots. Demonstrated on a low-cost robot arm, fiducial exoskeletons substantially simplify setup while improving calibration, state accuracy, and downstream 3D control performance. We release code and printable hardware designs to enable further algorithm-hardware co-design.</description>

      <title>Robust Subpixel Localization of Diagonal Markers in Large-Scale Navigation via Multi-Layer Screening and Adaptive Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a robust, high-precision positioning methodology to address localization failures arising from complex background interference in large-scale flight navigation and the computational inefficiency inherent in conventional sliding window matching techniques. The proposed methodology employs a three-tiered framework incorporating multi-layer corner screening and adaptive template matching. Firstly, dimensionality is reduced through illumination equalization and structural information extraction. A coarse-to-fine candidate selection strategy minimizes sliding window computational costs, enabling rapid estimation of the marker's position. Finally, adaptive templates are generated for candidate points, achieving subpixel precision through improved template matching with correlation coefficient extremum fitting. Experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in extracting and localizing diagonal markers in complex, large-scale environments, making it ideal for field-of-view measurement in navigation tasks.</description>

      <title>Temporal-Enhanced Interpretable Multi-Modal Prognosis and Risk Stratification Framework for Diabetic Retinopathy (TIMM-ProRS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR), affecting millions globally with projections indicating a significant rise, poses a severe blindness risk and strains healthcare systems. Diagnostic complexity arises from visual symptom overlap with conditions like age-related macular degeneration and hypertensive retinopathy, exacerbated by high misdiagnosis rates in underserved regions. This study introduces TIMM-ProRS, a novel deep learning framework integrating Vision Transformer (ViT), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Graph Neural Network (GNN) with multi-modal fusion. TIMM-ProRS uniquely leverages both retinal images and temporal biomarkers (HbA1c, retinal thickness) to capture multi-modal and temporal dynamics. Evaluated comprehensively across diverse datasets including APTOS 2019 (trained), Messidor-2, RFMiD, EyePACS, and Messidor-1 (validated), the model achieves 97.8\% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.96, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and outperforming existing methods like RSG-Net and DeepDR. This approach enables early, precise, and interpretable diagnosis, supporting scalable telemedical management and enhancing global eye health sustainability.</description>

      <title>Deep Exploration of Epoch-wise Double Descent in Noisy Data: Signal Separation, Large Activation, and Benign Overfitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep double descent is one of the key phenomena underlying the generalization capability of deep learning models. In this study, epoch-wise double descent, which is delayed generalization following overfitting, was empirically investigated by focusing on the evolution of internal structures. Fully connected neural networks of three different sizes were trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset with 30% label noise. By decomposing the loss curves into signal contributions from clean and noisy training data, the epoch-wise evolutions of internal signals were analyzed separately. Three main findings were obtained from this analysis. First, the model achieved strong re-generalization on test data even after perfectly fitting noisy training data during the double descent phase, corresponding to a "benign overfitting" state. Second, noisy data were learned after clean data, and as learning progressed, their corresponding internal activations became increasingly separated in outer layers; this enabled the model to overfit only noisy data. Third, a single, very large activation emerged in the shallow layer across all models; this phenomenon is referred as "outliers," "massive activa-tions," and "super activations" in recent large language models and evolves with re-generalization. The magnitude of large activation correlated with input patterns but not with output patterns. These empirical findings directly link the recent key phenomena of "deep double descent," "benign overfitting," and "large activation", and support the proposal of a novel scenario for understanding deep double descent.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Distribution Adaptation for Diffusion Models via Maximum Mean Discrepancy Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for both unconditional and conditional sample generation, yet their outputs often deviate from the characteristics of user-specific target data. Such mismatches are especially problematic in domain adaptation tasks, where only a few reference examples are available and retraining the diffusion model is infeasible. Existing inference-time guidance methods can adjust sampling trajectories, but they typically optimize surrogate objectives such as classifier likelihoods rather than directly aligning with the target distribution. We propose MMD Guidance, a training-free mechanism that augments the reverse diffusion process with gradients of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between generated samples and a reference dataset. MMD provides reliable distributional estimates from limited data, exhibits low variance in practice, and is efficiently differentiable, which makes it particularly well-suited for the guidance task. Our framework naturally extends to prompt-aware adaptation in conditional generation models via product kernels. Also, it can be applied with computational efficiency in latent diffusion models (LDMs), since guidance is applied in the latent space of the LDM. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that MMD Guidance can achieve distributional alignment while preserving sample fidelity.</description>

      <title>DiffMM: Efficient Method for Accurate Noisy and Sparse Trajectory Map Matching via One Step Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Map matching for sparse trajectories is a fundamental problem for many trajectory-based applications, e.g., traffic scheduling and traffic flow analysis. Existing methods for map matching are generally based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or encoder-decoder framework. However, these methods continue to face significant challenges when handling noisy or sparsely sampled GPS trajectories. To address these limitations, we propose DiffMM, an encoder-diffusion-based map matching framework that produces effective yet efficient matching results through a one-step diffusion process. We first introduce a road segment-aware trajectory encoder that jointly embeds the input trajectory and its surrounding candidate road segments into a shared latent space through an attention mechanism. Next, we propose a one step diffusion method to realize map matching through a shortcut model by leveraging the joint embedding of the trajectory and candidate road segments as conditioning context. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale trajectory datasets, demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art map matching methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, particularly for sparse trajectories and complex road network topologies.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we propose a new keyframe-based mapping system. The proposed method updates local Normal Distribution Transform maps (NDT) using data from an RGB-D sensor. The cells of the NDT are stored in 2D view-dependent structures to better utilize the properties and uncertainty model of RGB-D cameras. This method naturally represents an object closer to the camera origin with higher precision. The local maps are stored in the pose graph which allows correcting global map after loop closure detection. We also propose a procedure that allows merging and filtering local maps to obtain a global map of the environment. Finally, we compare our method with Octomap and NDT-OM and provide example applications of the proposed mapping method.</description>

      <title>VeriTaS: The First Dynamic Benchmark for Multimodal Automated Fact-Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing scale of online misinformation urgently demands Automated Fact-Checking (AFC). Existing benchmarks for evaluating AFC systems, however, are largely limited in terms of task scope, modalities, domain, language diversity, realism, or coverage of misinformation types. Critically, they are static, thus subject to data leakage as their claims enter the pretraining corpora of LLMs. As a result, benchmark performance no longer reliably reflects the actual ability to verify claims. We introduce Verified Theses and Statements (VeriTaS), the first dynamic benchmark for multimodal AFC, designed to remain robust under ongoing large-scale pretraining of foundation models. VeriTaS currently comprises 24,000 real-world claims from 108 professional fact-checking organizations across 54 languages, covering textual and audiovisual content. Claims are added quarterly via a fully automated seven-stage pipeline that normalizes claim formulation, retrieves original media, and maps heterogeneous expert verdicts to a novel, standardized, and disentangled scoring scheme with textual justifications. Through human evaluation, we demonstrate that the automated annotations closely match human judgments. We commit to update VeriTaS in the future, establishing a leakage-resistant benchmark, supporting meaningful AFC evaluation in the era of rapidly evolving foundation models. We will make the code and data publicly available.</description>

      <title>ViDoRe V3: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Retrieval Augmented Generation in Complex Real-World Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines must address challenges beyond simple single-document retrieval, such as interpreting visual elements (tables, charts, images), synthesizing information across documents, and providing accurate source grounding. Existing benchmarks fail to capture this complexity, often focusing on textual data, single-document comprehension, or evaluating retrieval and generation in isolation. We introduce ViDoRe v3, a comprehensive multimodal RAG benchmark featuring multi-type queries over visually rich document corpora. It covers 10 datasets across diverse professional domains, comprising ~26,000 document pages paired with 3,099 human-verified queries, each available in 6 languages. Through 12,000 hours of human annotation effort, we provide high-quality annotations for retrieval relevance, bounding box localization, and verified reference answers. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art RAG pipelines reveals that visual retrievers outperform textual ones, late-interaction models and textual reranking substantially improve performance, and hybrid or purely visual contexts enhance answer generation quality. However, current models still struggle with non-textual elements, open-ended queries, and fine-grained visual grounding. To encourage progress in addressing these challenges, the benchmark is released under a commercially permissive license at https://hf.co/vidore.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting anomalies in high-dimensional, time-dependent simulation data is challenging due to complex spatial and temporal dynamics. We study reconstruction-based anomaly detection for ensemble data from parameterized K\'arm\'an vortex street simulations using convolutional autoencoders. We compare a 2D autoencoder operating on individual frames with a 3D autoencoder that processes short temporal stacks. The 2D model identifies localized spatial irregularities in single time steps, while the 3D model exploits spatio-temporal context to detect anomalous motion patterns and reduces redundant detections across time. We further evaluate volumetric time-dependent data and find that reconstruction errors are strongly influenced by the spatial distribution of mass, with highly concentrated regions yielding larger errors than dispersed configurations. Our results highlight the importance of temporal context for robust anomaly detection in dynamic simulations.</description>

      <title>VLingNav: Embodied Navigation with Adaptive Reasoning and Visual-Assisted Linguistic Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: VLA models have shown promising potential in embodied navigation by unifying perception and planning while inheriting the strong generalization abilities of large VLMs. However, most existing VLA models rely on reactive mappings directly from observations to actions, lacking the explicit reasoning capabilities and persistent memory required for complex, long-horizon navigation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose VLingNav, a VLA model for embodied navigation grounded in linguistic-driven cognition. First, inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, we introduce an adaptive chain-of-thought mechanism, which dynamically triggers explicit reasoning only when necessary, enabling the agent to fluidly switch between fast, intuitive execution and slow, deliberate planning. Second, to handle long-horizon spatial dependencies, we develop a visual-assisted linguistic memory module that constructs a persistent, cross-modal semantic memory, enabling the agent to recall past observations to prevent repetitive exploration and infer movement trends for dynamic environments. For the training recipe, we construct Nav-AdaCoT-2.9M, the largest embodied navigation dataset with reasoning annotations to date, enriched with adaptive CoT annotations that induce a reasoning paradigm capable of adjusting both when to think and what to think about. Moreover, we incorporate an online expert-guided reinforcement learning stage, enabling the model to surpass pure imitation learning and to acquire more robust, self-explored navigation behaviors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLingNav achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of embodied navigation benchmarks. Notably, VLingNav transfers to real-world robotic platforms in a zero-shot manner, executing various navigation tasks and demonstrating strong cross-domain and cross-task generalization.</description>

      <title>Blind Deconvolution in Astronomy: How Does a Standalone U-Net Perform?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims: This study investigates whether a U-Net architecture can perform standalone end-to-end blind deconvolution of astronomical images without any prior knowledge of the Point Spread Function (PSF) or noise characteristics. Our goal is to evaluate its performance against the number of training images, classical Tikhonov deconvolution and to assess its generalization capability under varying seeing conditions and noise levels.
  Methods: Realistic astronomical observations are simulated using the GalSim toolkit, incorporating random transformations, PSF convolution (accounting for both optical and atmospheric effects), and Gaussian white noise. A U-Net model is trained using a Mean Square Error (MSE) loss function on datasets of varying sizes, up to 40,000 images of size 48x48 from the COSMOS Real Galaxy Dataset. Performance is evaluated using PSNR, SSIM, and cosine similarity metrics, with the latter employed in a two-model framework to assess solution stability.
  Results: The U-Net model demonstrates effectiveness in blind deconvolution, with performance improving consistently as the training dataset size increases, saturating beyond 5,000 images. Cosine similarity analysis reveals convergence between independently trained models, indicating stable solutions. Remarkably, the U-Net outperforms the oracle-like Tikhonov method in challenging conditions (low PSNR/medium SSIM). The model also generalizes well to unseen seeing and noise conditions, although optimal performance is achieved when training parameters include validation conditions. Experiments on synthetic $C^\alpha$ images further support the hypothesis that the U-Net learns a geometry-adaptive harmonic basis, akin to sparse representations observed in denoising tasks. These results align with recent mathematical insights into its adaptive learning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Region of interest detection for efficient aortic segmentation</title>

Abstract: Thoracic aortic dissection and aneurysms are the most lethal diseases of the aorta. The major hindrance to treatment lies in the accurate analysis of the medical images. More particularly, aortic segmentation of the 3D image is often tedious and difficult. Deep-learning-based segmentation models are an ideal solution, but their inability to deliver usable outputs in difficult cases and their computational cost cause their clinical adoption to stay limited. This study presents an innovative approach for efficient aortic segmentation using targeted region of interest (ROI) detection. In contrast to classical detection models, we propose a simple and efficient detection model that can be widely applied to detect a single ROI. Our detection model is trained as a multi-task model, using an encoder-decoder architecture for segmentation and a fully connected network attached to the bottleneck for detection. We compare the performance of a one-step segmentation model applied to a complete image, nnU-Net and our cascade model composed of a detection and a segmentation step. We achieve a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.944 with over 0.9 for all cases using a third of the computing power. This simple solution achieves state-of-the-art performance while being compact and robust, making it an ideal solution for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>MEMEWEAVER: Inter-Meme Graph Reasoning for Sexism and Misogyny Detection</title>

Abstract: Women are twice as likely as men to face online harassment due to their gender. Despite recent advances in multimodal content moderation, most approaches still overlook the social dynamics behind this phenomenon, where perpetrators reinforce prejudices and group identity within like-minded communities. Graph-based methods offer a promising way to capture such interactions, yet existing solutions remain limited by heuristic graph construction, shallow modality fusion, and instance-level reasoning. In this work, we present MemeWeaver, an end-to-end trainable multimodal framework for detecting sexism and misogyny through a novel inter-meme graph reasoning mechanism. We systematically evaluate multiple visual--textual fusion strategies and show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on the MAMI and EXIST benchmarks, while achieving faster training convergence. Further analyses reveal that the learned graph structure captures semantically meaningful patterns, offering valuable insights into the relational nature of online hate.</description>

      <title>Automated Lesion Segmentation of Stroke MRI Using nnU-Net: A Comprehensive External Validation Across Acute and Chronic Lesions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and generalisable segmentation of stroke lesions from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for advancing clinical research, prognostic modelling, and personalised interventions. Although deep learning has improved automated lesion delineation, many existing models are optimised for narrow imaging contexts and generalise poorly to independent datasets, modalities, and stroke stages. Here, we systematically evaluated stroke lesion segmentation using the nnU-Net framework across multiple heterogeneous, publicly available MRI datasets spanning acute and chronic stroke. Models were trained and tested on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and T1-weighted MRI, and evaluated on independent datasets. Across stroke stages, models showed robust generalisation, with segmentation accuracy approaching reported inter-rater reliability. Performance varied with imaging modality and training data characteristics. In acute stroke, DWI-trained models consistently outperformed FLAIR-based models, with only modest gains from multimodal combinations. In chronic stroke, increasing training set size improved performance, with diminishing returns beyond several hundred cases. Lesion volume was a key determinant of accuracy: smaller lesions were harder to segment, and models trained on restricted volume ranges generalised poorly. MRI image quality further constrained generalisability: models trained on lower-quality scans transferred poorly, whereas those trained on higher-quality data generalised well to noisier images. Discrepancies between predictions and reference masks were often attributable to limitations in manual annotations. Together, these findings show that automated lesion segmentation can approach human-level performance while identifying key factors governing generalisability and informing the development of lesion segmentation tools.</description>

Abstract: Localization is a fundamental capability for autonomous robots, enabling them to operate effectively in dynamic environments. In Robocon 2025, accurate and reliable localization is crucial for improving shooting precision, avoiding collisions with other robots, and navigating the competition field efficiently.

Abstract: We propose a novel piecewise smooth image model with piecewise constant local parameters that are automatically adapted to each image. Technically, the model is formulated in terms of factor graphs with NUP (normal with unknown parameters) priors, and the pertinent computations amount to iterations of conjugate-gradient steps and Gaussian message passing. The proposed model and algorithms are demonstrated with applications to denoising and contrast enhancement.</description>

      <title>M3CoTBench: Benchmark Chain-of-Thought of MLLMs in Medical Image Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has proven effective in enhancing large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning, and recent advances have extended this paradigm to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). In the medical domain, where diagnostic decisions depend on nuanced visual cues and sequential reasoning, CoT aligns naturally with clinical thinking processes. However, Current benchmarks for medical image understanding generally focus on the final answer while ignoring the reasoning path. An opaque process lacks reliable bases for judgment, making it difficult to assist doctors in diagnosis. To address this gap, we introduce a new M3CoTBench benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the correctness, efficiency, impact, and consistency of CoT reasoning in medical image understanding. M3CoTBench features 1) a diverse, multi-level difficulty dataset covering 24 examination types, 2) 13 varying-difficulty tasks, 3) a suite of CoT-specific evaluation metrics (correctness, efficiency, impact, and consistency) tailored to clinical reasoning, and 4) a performance analysis of multiple MLLMs. M3CoTBench systematically evaluates CoT reasoning across diverse medical imaging tasks, revealing current limitations of MLLMs in generating reliable and clinically interpretable reasoning, and aims to foster the development of transparent, trustworthy, and diagnostically accurate AI systems for healthcare.

      <description>arXiv:2406.09838v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meteorological heatmaps play a vital role in deciphering extreme weather phenomena, yet their inherent complexities marked by irregular contours, unstructured patterns, and complex color variations present unique analytical hurdles for state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Current state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o, Qwen-VL, and LLaVA 1.6 struggle with tasks such as precise color identification and spatial localization, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete interpretations. To address these challenges, we introduce Sparse Position and Outline Tracking (SPOT), a novel algorithm specifically designed to process irregularly shaped colored regions in visual data. SPOT identifies and localizes these regions by extracting their spatial coordinates, enabling structured representations of irregular shapes. Building on SPOT, we construct ClimateIQA, a novel meteorological visual question answering (VQA) dataset, comprising 26,280 high-resolution heatmaps and 762,120 instruction samples for wind gust, total precipitation, wind chill index and heat index analysis. ClimateIQA enhances VLM training by incorporating spatial cues, geographic metadata, and reanalysis data, improving model accuracy in interpreting and describing extreme weather features. Furthermore, we develop Climate-Zoo, a suite of fine-tuned VLMs based on SPOT-empowered ClimateIQA, which significantly outperforms existing models in meteorological heatmap tasks.</description>

Abstract: 3D reconstruction aims to recover the dense 3D structure of a scene. It plays an essential role in various applications such as Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), autonomous driving and robotics. Leveraging multiple views of a scene captured from different viewpoints, Multi-View Stereo (MVS) algorithms synthesize a comprehensive 3D representation, enabling precise reconstruction in complex environments. Due to its efficiency and effectiveness, MVS has become a pivotal method for image-based 3D reconstruction. Recently, with the success of deep learning, many learning-based MVS methods have been proposed, achieving impressive performance against traditional methods. We categorize these learning-based methods as: depth map-based, voxel-based, NeRF-based, 3D Gaussian Splatting-based, and large feed-forward methods. Among these, we focus significantly on depth map-based methods, which are the main family of MVS due to their conciseness, flexibility and scalability. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature at the time of this writing. We investigate these learning-based methods, summarize their performances on popular benchmarks, and discuss promising future research directions in this area.</description>

      <title>MSSF: A 4D Radar and Camera Fusion Framework With Multi-Stage Sampling for 3D Object Detection in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As one of the automotive sensors that have emerged in recent years, 4D millimeter-wave radar has a higher resolution than conventional 3D radar and provides precise elevation measurements. But its point clouds are still sparse and noisy, making it challenging to meet the requirements of autonomous driving. Camera, as another commonly used sensor, can capture rich semantic information. As a result, the fusion of 4D radar and camera can provide an affordable and robust perception solution for autonomous driving systems. However, previous radar-camera fusion methods have not yet been thoroughly investigated, resulting in a large performance gap compared to LiDAR-based methods. Specifically, they ignore the feature-blurring problem and do not deeply interact with image semantic information. To this end, we present a simple but effective multi-stage sampling fusion (MSSF) network based on 4D radar and camera. On the one hand, we design a fusion block that can deeply interact point cloud features with image features, and can be applied to commonly used single-modal backbones in a plug-and-play manner. The fusion block encompasses two types, namely, simple feature fusion (SFF) and multiscale deformable feature fusion (MSDFF). The SFF is easy to implement, while the MSDFF has stronger fusion abilities. On the other hand, we propose a semantic-guided head to perform foreground-background segmentation on voxels with voxel feature re-weighting, further alleviating the problem of feature blurring. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadset datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our MSSF. Notably, compared to state-of-the-art methods, MSSF achieves a 7.0% and 4.0% improvement in 3D mean average precision on the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets, respectively. It even surpasses classical LiDAR-based methods on the VoD dataset.</description>

      <title>Generating crossmodal gene expression from cancer histopathology improves multimodal AI predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00568v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging research has highlighted that artificial intelligence-based multimodal fusion of digital pathology and transcriptomic features can improve cancer diagnosis (grading/subtyping) and prognosis (survival risk) prediction. However, such direct fusion is impractical in clinical settings, where histopathology remains the gold standard and transcriptomic tests are rarely requested in public healthcare. We experiment on two publicly available multimodal datasets, The Cancer Genomic Atlas and the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium, spanning four independent cohorts: glioma-glioblastoma, renal, uterine, and breast, and observe significant performance gains in gradation and risk estimation (p-value&lt;0.05) when incorporating synthesized transcriptomic data with WSIs. Also, predictions using synthesized features were statistically close to those obtained with real transcriptomic data (p-value&gt;0.05), consistently across cohorts. Here we show that with our diffusion based crossmodal generative AI model, PathGen, gene expressions synthesized from digital histopathology jointly predict cancer grading and patient survival risk with high accuracy (state-of-the-art performance), certainty (through conformal coverage guarantee) and interpretability (through distributed co-attention maps). PathGen code is available for open use on GitHub at https://github.com/Samiran-Dey/PathGen.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Self-Pruning Intrinsic Selection Method for Training-Free Multimodal Data Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual instruction tuning adapts pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to follow human instructions for real-world applications. However, the rapid growth of these datasets introduces significant redundancy, leading to increased computational costs. Existing methods for selecting instruction data aim to prune this redundancy, but predominantly rely on computationally demanding techniques such as proxy-based inference or training-based metrics. Consequently, the substantial computational costs incurred by these selection processes often exacerbate the very efficiency bottlenecks they are intended to resolve, posing a significant challenge to the scalable and effective tuning of MLLMs. To address this challenge, we first identify a critical, yet previously overlooked, factor: the anisotropy inherent in visual feature distributions. We find that this anisotropy induces a \textit{Global Semantic Drift}, and overlooking this phenomenon is a key factor limiting the efficiency of current data selection methods. Motivated by this insight, we devise \textbf{PRISM}, the first training-free framework for efficient visual instruction selection. PRISM surgically removes the corrupting influence of global background features by modeling the intrinsic visual semantics via implicit re-centering. Empirically, PRISM reduces the end-to-end time for data selection and model tuning to just 30\% of conventional pipelines. More remarkably, it achieves this efficiency while simultaneously enhancing performance, surpassing models fine-tuned on the full dataset across eight multimodal and three language understanding benchmarks, culminating in a 101.7\% relative improvement over the baseline. The code is available for access via \href{https://github.com/bibisbar/PRISM}{this repository}.</description>

Abstract: Around 10% of newborns require some help to initiate breathing, and 5\% need ventilation assistance. Accurate Time of Birth (ToB) documentation is essential for optimizing neonatal care, as timely interventions are vital for proper resuscitation. However, current clinical methods for recording ToB often rely on manual processes, which can be prone to inaccuracies. In this study, we present a novel two-stream fusion system that combines the power of image and video analysis to accurately detect the ToB from thermal recordings in the delivery room and operating theater. By integrating static and dynamic streams, our approach captures richer birth-related spatiotemporal features, leading to more robust and precise ToB estimation. We demonstrate that this synergy between data modalities enhances performance over single-stream approaches. Our system achieves 95.7% precision and 84.8% recall in detecting birth within short video clips. Additionally, with the help of a score aggregation module, it successfully identifies ToB in 100% of test cases, with a median absolute error of 2 seconds and an absolute mean deviation of 4.5 seconds compared to manual annotations.</description>

Abstract: As an essential component of autonomous driving systems, high-definition (HD) maps provide rich and precise environmental information for auto-driving scenarios; however, existing methods, which primarily rely on query-based detection frameworks to directly model map elements or implicitly propagate queries over time, often struggle to maintain consistent temporal perception outcomes. These inconsistencies pose significant challenges to the stability and reliability of real-world autonomous driving and map data collection systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end tracking framework for global map construction by temporally tracking map elements' historical trajectories. Firstly, instance-level historical rasterization map representation is designed to explicitly store previous perception results, which can control and maintain different global instances' history information in a fine-grained way. Secondly, we introduce a Map-Trajectory Prior Fusion module within this tracking framework, leveraging historical priors for tracked instances to improve temporal smoothness and continuity. Thirdly, we propose a global perspective metric to evaluate the quality of temporal geometry construction in HD maps, filling the gap in current metrics for assessing global geometric perception results. Substantial experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both single-frame and temporal metrics.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm in fundamental cross-modality research, demonstrating significant potential in both image understanding and generation. However, existing research in the face domain primarily faces two challenges: $\textbf{(1)}$ $\textbf{fragmentation development}$, with existing methods failing to unify understanding and generation into a single one, hindering the way to artificial general intelligence. $\textbf{(2) lack of fine-grained facial attributes}$, which are crucial for high-fidelity applications. To handle those issues, we propose $\textbf{UniF$^2$ace}$, $\textit{the first UMM specifically tailored for fine-grained face understanding and generation}$. $\textbf{First}$, we introduce a novel theoretical framework with a Dual Discrete Diffusion (D3Diff) loss, unifying masked generative models with discrete score matching diffusion and leading to a more precise approximation of the negative log-likelihood. Moreover, this D3Diff significantly enhances the model's ability to synthesize high-fidelity facial details aligned with text input. $\textbf{Second}$, we propose a multi-level grouped Mixture-of-Experts architecture, adaptively incorporating the semantic and identity facial embeddings to complement the attribute forgotten phenomenon in representation evolvement. $\textbf{Finally}$, to this end, we construct UniF$^2$aceD-1M, a large-scale dataset comprising 130K fine-grained image-caption pairs and 1M visual question-answering pairs, spanning a much wider range of facial attributes than existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniF$^2$ace outperforms existing models with a similar scale in both understanding and generation tasks, with 7.1\% higher Desc-GPT and 6.6\% higher VQA-score, respectively.</description>

Abstract: Understanding human behavior requires measuring behavioral actions. Due to its complexity, behavior is best mapped onto a rich, semantic structure such as language. Emerging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are promising candidates, but their fine-grained action understanding ability has not been fully examined. In this work, we reformulate EPIC-KITCHENS-100, one of the largest and most challenging egocentric action recognition datasets, into a MLLM benchmark (EPIC-KITCHENS-100-MQA). We demonstrate that when we sample difficult answers based on specialist models as distractors, leading MLLMs struggle to recognize the correct actions. How can we increase the performance of MLLMs? We curated a supervised finetuning dataset that includes `hard' action recognition, temporal detection, captioning, and free-form question answering to improve models' diverse action understanding capabilities. We introduce a new model called LLaVAction that adds an action token to boost models' attention on visual tokens and a two-stage pipeline to obtain structured actions. LLaVAction greatly improves the MLLMs' ability of action understanding, achieving strong improvements on both MLLM benchmarks (21 points in accuracy over GPT-4o on EPIC-KITCHENS-100-MQA) and established action recognition benchmarks, suggesting that our methods prepare MLLMs to be a promising path forward for complex action tasks. Code, data, the benchmark, and models are available at https://github.com/AdaptiveMotorControlLab/LLaVAction.</description>

      <title>Latent Reconstruction from Generated Data for Multimodal Misinformation Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, such as miscaptioned images, where captions misrepresent an image's origin, context, or meaning, poses a growing challenge in the digital age. Due to the scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD), recent approaches rely on synthetic training data created via out-of-context pairings or named entity manipulations (e.g., altering names, dates, or locations). However, these often yield simplistic, unrealistic examples, which limits their utility as training examples. To address this, we introduce "MisCaption This!", a framework for generating high-fidelity synthetic miscaptioned datasets through Adversarial Prompting of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Additionally, we introduce "Latent Multimodal Reconstruction" (LAMAR), a Transformer-based network trained to reconstruct the embeddings of truthful captions, providing a strong auxiliary signal to guide detection. We explore various training strategies (end-to-end vs. large-scale pre-training) and integration mechanisms (direct, mask, gate, and attention). Extensive experiments show that models trained on "MisCaption This!" data generalize better to real-world misinformation, while LAMAR achieves new state-of-the-art on NewsCLIPpings, VERITE, and the newly introduced VERITE 24/25 benchmark; highlighting the efficacy of VLM-generated data and reconstruction-based networks for advancing MMD.

      <title>CasTex: Cascaded Text-to-Texture Synthesis via Explicit Texture Maps and Physically-Based Shading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates text-to-texture synthesis using diffusion models to generate physically-based texture maps. We aim to achieve realistic model appearances under varying lighting conditions. A prominent solution for the task is score distillation sampling. It allows recovering a complex texture using gradient guidance given a differentiable rasterization and shading pipeline. However, in practice, the aforementioned solution in conjunction with the widespread latent diffusion models produces severe visual artifacts and requires additional regularization such as implicit texture parameterization. As a more direct alternative, we propose an approach using cascaded diffusion models for texture synthesis (CasTex). In our setup, score distillation sampling yields high-quality textures out-of-the box. In particular, we were able to omit implicit texture parameterization in favor of an explicit parameterization to improve the procedure. In the experiments, we show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art optimization-based solutions on public texture synthesis benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A Diff-Attention Aware State Space Fusion Model for Remote Sensing Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) images describe the same land surface, so these images not only have their own advantages, but also have a lot of similar information. In order to separate these similar information and their respective advantages, reduce the feature redundancy in the fusion stage. This paper introduces a diff-attention aware state space fusion model (DAS2F-Model) for multimodal remote sensing image classification. Based on the selective state space model, a cross-modal diff-attention module (CMDA-Module) is designed to extract and separate the common features and their respective dominant features of MS and PAN images. Among this, space preserving visual mamba (SPVM) retains image spatial features and captures local features by optimizing visual mamba's input reasonably. Considering that features in the fusion stage will have large semantic differences after feature separation and simple fusion operations struggle to effectively integrate these significantly different features, an attention-aware linear fusion module (AALF-Module) is proposed. It performs pixel-wise linear fusion by calculating influence coefficients. This mechanism can fuse features with large semantic differences while keeping the feature size unchanged. Empirical evaluations indicate that the presented method achieves better results than alternative approaches. The relevant code can be found at:https://github.com/AVKSKVL/DAS-F-Model</description>

      <title>DriveRX: A Vision-Language Reasoning Model for Cross-Task Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective autonomous driving hinges on robust reasoning across perception, prediction, planning, and behavior. However, conventional end-to-end models fail to generalize in complex scenarios due to the lack of structured reasoning. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) have been applied to driving tasks, they typically rely on isolated modules and static supervision, limiting their ability to support multi-stage decision-making. We present AutoDriveRL, a unified training framework that formulates autonomous driving as a structured reasoning process over four core tasks. Each task is independently modeled as a vision-language QA problem and optimized using task-specific reward models, enabling fine-grained reinforcement signals at different reasoning stages. Within this framework, we train DriveRX, a cross-task reasoning VLM designed for multi-stage decision-making. DriveRX achieves strong performance on the public benchmark, outperforming GPT-4o in behavior reasoning and demonstrating robustness under complex or corrupted driving conditions. DriveRX serves as a high-level semantic reasoning backbone, producing structured stage-wise reasoning chains that enhance decision consistency. These outputs also provide high-quality supervisory signals for annotation and downstream planning/control models. We release the AutoDriveRL framework and DriveRX to support future research.</description>

      <title>Unifying Appearance Codes and Bilateral Grids for Driving Scene Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05280v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural rendering techniques, including NeRF and Gaussian Splatting (GS), rely on photometric consistency to produce high-quality reconstructions. However, in real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric inconsistency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based text-to-motion generation have led to impressive progress in synthesizing high-quality human motion. Nevertheless, jointly achieving high fidelity, streaming capability, real-time responsiveness, and scalability remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we propose MOGO (Motion Generation with One-pass), a novel autoregressive framework tailored for efficient and real-time 3D motion generation. MOGO comprises two key components: (1) MoSA-VQ, a motion scale-adaptive residual vector quantization module that hierarchically discretizes motion sequences with learnable scaling to produce compact yet expressive representations; and (2) RQHC-Transformer, a residual quantized hierarchical causal transformer that generates multi-layer motion tokens in a single forward pass, significantly reducing inference latency. To enhance semantic fidelity, we further introduce a text condition alignment mechanism that improves motion decoding under textual control. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP demonstrate that MOGO achieves competitive or superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based methods, while offering substantial improvements in real-time performance, streaming generation, and generalization under zero-shot settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autoencoders empower state-of-the-art image and video generative models by compressing pixels into a latent space through visual tokenization. Although recent advances have alleviated the performance degradation of autoencoders under high compression ratios, addressing the training instability caused by GAN remains an open challenge. While improving spatial compression, we also aim to minimize the latent space dimensionality, enabling more efficient and compact representations. To tackle these challenges, we focus on improving the decoder's expressiveness. Concretely, we propose DGAE, which employs a diffusion model to guide the decoder in recovering informative signals that are not fully decoded from the latent representation. With this design, DGAE effectively mitigates the performance degradation under high spatial compression rates. At the same time, DGAE achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 2x smaller latent space. When integrated with Diffusion Models, DGAE demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and shows that this compact latent representation facilitates faster convergence of the diffusion model.</description>

      <title>Divergence-Based Similarity Function for Multi-View Contrastive Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent success in contrastive learning has sparked growing interest in more effectively leveraging multiple augmented views of data. While prior methods incorporate multiple views at the loss or feature level, they primarily capture pairwise relationships and fail to model the joint structure across all views. In this work, we propose a divergence-based similarity function (DSF) that explicitly captures the joint structure by representing each set of augmented views as a distribution and measuring similarity as the divergence between distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSF consistently improves performance across diverse tasks, including kNN classification, linear evaluation, transfer learning, and distribution shift, while also achieving greater efficiency than other multi-view methods. Furthermore, we establish a connection between DSF and cosine similarity, and demonstrate that, unlike cosine similarity, DSF operates effectively without the need for tuning a temperature hyperparameter.</description>

      <title>Reconstruct, Inpaint, Test-Time Finetune: Dynamic Novel-view Synthesis from Monocular Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore novel-view synthesis for dynamic scenes from monocular videos. Prior approaches rely on costly test-time optimization of 4D representations or do not preserve scene geometry when trained in a feed-forward manner. Our approach is based on three key insights: (1) covisible pixels (that are visible in both the input and target views) can be rendered by first reconstructing the dynamic 3D scene and rendering the reconstruction from the novel-views and (2) hidden pixels in novel views can be "inpainted" with feed-forward 2D video diffusion models. Notably, our video inpainting diffusion model (CogNVS) can be self-supervised from 2D videos, allowing us to train it on a large corpus of in-the-wild videos. This in turn allows for (3) CogNVS to be applied zero-shot to novel test videos via test-time finetuning. We empirically verify that CogNVS outperforms almost all prior art for novel-view synthesis of dynamic scenes from monocular videos.</description>

      <title>Franca: Nested Matryoshka Clustering for Scalable Visual Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Franca (pronounced Fran-ka): free one; the first fully open-source (data, code, weights) vision foundation model that matches and in many cases surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art proprietary models, e.g., DINOv2, CLIP, SigLIPv2, etc. Our approach is grounded in a transparent training pipeline inspired by Web-SSL and uses publicly available data: ImageNet-21K and a subset of ReLAION-2B. Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in SSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to large codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to account for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we introduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on nested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features into increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size, enabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a novel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional biases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic content. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks, demonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions establish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and open a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for the broader AI community. The code and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/valeoai/Franca.</description>

Abstract: Reliable recognition and localization of surgical instruments in endoscopic video recordings are foundational for a wide range of applications in computer- and robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS), including surgical training, skill assessment, and autonomous assistance. However, robust performance under real-world conditions remains a significant challenge. Incorporating surgical context - such as the current procedural phase - has emerged as a promising strategy to improve robustness and interpretability.
  To address these challenges, we organized the Surgical Procedure Phase, Keypoint, and Instrument Recognition (PhaKIR) sub-challenge as part of the Endoscopic Vision (EndoVis) challenge at MICCAI 2024. We introduced a novel, multi-center dataset comprising thirteen full-length laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos collected from three distinct medical institutions, with unified annotations for three interrelated tasks: surgical phase recognition, instrument keypoint estimation, and instrument instance segmentation. Unlike existing datasets, ours enables joint investigation of instrument localization and procedural context within the same data while supporting the integration of temporal information across entire procedures.
  We report results and findings in accordance with the BIAS guidelines for biomedical image analysis challenges. The PhaKIR sub-challenge advances the field by providing a unique benchmark for developing temporally aware, context-driven methods in RAMIS and offers a high-quality resource to support future research in surgical scene understanding.</description>

      <title>SWAGSplatting: Semantic-guided Water-scene Augmented Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a challenging task due to light attenuation, scattering, and limited visibility. While recent AI-based approaches have advanced underwater imaging, they often overlook high-level semantic understanding, which is crucial for reconstructing complex scenes. In this paper, we propose SWAGSplatting, \textit{Semantic-guided Water-scene Augmented Gaussian Splatting}, a novel multimodal framework that integrates language and vision knowledge into 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity underwater reconstruction. Each Gaussian primitive is augmented with a learnable semantic feature, supervised using CLIP-based embeddings extracted from region-level semantic cues. A dedicated semantic consistency loss enforces alignment between geometric reconstruction and scene semantics. In addition, a stage-wise optimisation strategy combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement improves training stability and visual quality. Furthermore, we propose a 3D Gaussian Primitives Reallocation strategy to address the imbalanced distribution of primitives introduced by naive point cloud densification. Extensive experiments on the SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets demonstrate that SWAGSplatting consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, achieving up to a 3.48 dB improvement in PSNR, enabling more accurate and semantically coherent underwater scene reconstruction for applications in marine perception and exploration.</description>

      <title>PI3DETR: Parametric Instance Detection of 3D Point Cloud Edges With a Geometry-Aware 3DETR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present PI3DETR, an end-to-end framework that directly predicts 3D parametric curve instances from raw point clouds, avoiding the intermediate representations and multi-stage processing common in prior work. Extending 3DETR, our model introduces a geometry-aware matching strategy and specialized loss functions that enable unified detection of differently parameterized curve types, including cubic B\'ezier curves, line segments, circles, and arcs, in a single forward pass. Optional post-processing steps further refine predictions without adding complexity. This streamlined design improves robustness to noise and varying sampling densities, addressing critical challenges in real world LiDAR and 3D sensing scenarios. PI3DETR sets a new state-of-the-art on the ABC dataset and generalizes effectively to real sensor data, offering a simple yet powerful solution for 3D edge and curve estimation.</description>

      <title>Your Super Resolution Model is not Enough for Tackling Real-World Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR), traditional models often struggle to generalize across varying scale factors, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a plug-in Scale-Aware Attention Module (SAAM) designed to retrofit modern fixed-scale SR models with the ability to perform arbitrary-scale SR. SAAM employs lightweight, scale-adaptive feature extraction and upsampling, incorporating the Simple parameter-free Attention Module (SimAM) for efficient guidance and gradient variance loss to enhance sharpness in image details. Our method integrates seamlessly into multiple state-of-the-art SR backbones (e.g., SCNet, HiT-SR, OverNet), delivering competitive or superior performance across a wide range of integer and non-integer scale factors. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach enables robust multi-scale upscaling with minimal computational overhead, offering a practical solution for real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>GSAlign: Geometric and Semantic Alignment Network for Aerial-Ground Person Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aerial-Ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is an emerging yet challenging task that aims to match pedestrian images captured from drastically different viewpoints, typically from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground-based surveillance cameras. The task poses significant challenges due to extreme viewpoint discrepancies, occlusions, and domain gaps between aerial and ground imagery. While prior works have made progress by learning cross-view representations, they remain limited in handling severe pose variations and spatial misalignment. To address these issues, we propose a Geometric and Semantic Alignment Network (GSAlign) tailored for AG-ReID. GSAlign introduces two key components to jointly tackle geometric distortion and semantic misalignment in aerial-ground matching: a Learnable Thin Plate Spline (LTPS) Module and a Dynamic Alignment Module (DAM). The LTPS module adaptively warps pedestrian features based on a set of learned keypoints, effectively compensating for geometric variations caused by extreme viewpoint changes. In parallel, the DAM estimates visibility-aware representation masks that highlight visible body regions at the semantic level, thereby alleviating the negative impact of occlusions and partial observations in cross-view correspondence. A comprehensive evaluation on CARGO with four matching protocols demonstrates the effectiveness of GSAlign, achieving significant improvements of +18.8\% in mAP and +16.8\% in Rank-1 accuracy over previous state-of-the-art methods on the aerial-ground setting.</description>

      <title>SemiETPicker: Fast and Label-Efficient Particle Picking for CryoET Tomography Using Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cryogenic Electron Tomography (CryoET) combined with sub-volume averaging (SVA) is the only imaging modality capable of resolving protein structures inside cells at molecular resolution. Particle picking, the task of localizing and classifying target proteins in 3D CryoET volumes, remains the main bottleneck. Due to the reliance on time-consuming manual labels, the vast reserve of unlabeled tomograms remains underutilized. In this work, we present a fast, label-efficient semi-supervised framework that exploits this untapped data. Our framework consists of two components: (i) an end-to-end heatmap-supervised detection model inspired by keypoint detection, and (ii) a teacher-student co-training mechanism that enhances performance under sparse labeling conditions. Furthermore, we introduce multi-view pseudo-labeling and a CryoET-specific DropBlock augmentation strategy to further boost performance. Extensive evaluations on the large-scale CZII dataset show that our approach improves F1 by 10% over supervised baselines, underscoring the promise of semi-supervised learning for leveraging unlabeled CryoET data.</description>

      <title>MDReID: Modality-Decoupled Learning for Any-to-Any Multi-Modal Object Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world object re-identification (ReID) systems often face modality inconsistencies, where query and gallery images come from different sensors (e.g., RGB, NIR, TIR). However, most existing methods assume modality-matched conditions, which limits their robustness and scalability in practical applications. To address this challenge, we propose MDReID, a flexible any-to-any image-level ReID framework designed to operate under both modality-matched and modality-mismatched scenarios. MDReID builds on the insight that modality information can be decomposed into two components: modality-shared features that are predictable and transferable, and modality-specific features that capture unique, modality-dependent characteristics. To effectively leverage this, MDReID introduces two key components: the Modality Decoupling Learning (MDL) and Modality-aware Metric Learning (MML). Specifically, MDL explicitly decomposes modality features into modality-shared and modality-specific representations, enabling effective retrieval in both modality-aligned and mismatched scenarios. MML, a tailored metric learning strategy, further enforces orthogonality and complementarity between the two components to enhance discriminative power across modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging multi-modality ReID benchmarks (RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) consistently demonstrate the superiority of MDReID. Notably, MDReID achieves significant mAP improvements of 9.8\%, 3.0\%, and 11.5\% in general modality-matched scenarios, and average gains of 3.4\%, 11.8\%, and 10.9\% in modality-mismatched scenarios, respectively.

      <title>Global 3D Reconstruction of Clouds &amp; Tropical Cyclones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04773v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclones (TCs) remains challenging due to limited satellite observations probing TC structure and difficulties in resolving cloud properties involved in TC intensification. Recent research has demonstrated the capabilities of machine learning methods for 3D cloud reconstruction from satellite observations. However, existing approaches have been restricted to regions where TCs are uncommon, and are poorly validated for intense storms. We introduce a new framework, based on a pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline, that learns from multiple satellites with global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of relevant cloud properties. We apply our model to a custom-built TC dataset to evaluate performance in the most challenging and relevant conditions. We show that we can - for the first time - create global instantaneous 3D cloud maps and accurately reconstruct the 3D structure of intense storms. Our model not only extends available satellite observations but also provides estimates when observations are missing entirely. This is crucial for advancing our understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts.</description>

      <title>PINGS-X: Physics-Informed Normalized Gaussian Splatting with Axes Alignment for Efficient Super-Resolution of 4D Flow MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/SpatialAILab/PINGS-X.</description>

      <title>Backdoor Attacks on Open Vocabulary Object Detectors via Multi-Modal Prompt Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detectors (OVODs) unify vision and language to detect arbitrary object categories based on text prompts, enabling strong zero-shot generalization to novel concepts. As these models gain traction in high-stakes applications such as robotics, autonomous driving, and surveillance, understanding their security risks becomes crucial. In this work, we conduct the first study of backdoor attacks on OVODs and reveal a new attack surface introduced by prompt tuning. We propose TrAP (Trigger-Aware Prompt tuning), a multi-modal backdoor injection strategy that jointly optimizes prompt parameters in both image and text modalities along with visual triggers. TrAP enables the attacker to implant malicious behavior using lightweight, learnable prompt tokens without retraining the base model weights, thus preserving generalization while embedding a hidden backdoor. We adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that progressively shrinks the trigger size, enabling effective backdoor activation using small trigger patches at inference. Experiments across multiple datasets show that TrAP achieves high attack success rates for both object misclassification and object disappearance attacks, while also improving clean image performance on downstream datasets compared to the zero-shot setting.

      <description>arXiv:2511.19137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Film set design plays a pivotal role in cinematic storytelling and shaping the visual atmosphere. However, the traditional process depends on expert-driven manual modeling, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we introduce FilmSceneDesigner, an automated scene generation system that emulates professional film set design workflow. Given a natural language description, including scene type, historical period, and style, we design an agent-based chaining framework to generate structured parameters aligned with film set design workflow, guided by prompt strategies that ensure parameter accuracy and coherence. On the other hand, we propose a procedural generation pipeline which executes a series of dedicated functions with the structured parameters for floorplan and structure generation, material assignment, door and window placement, and object retrieval and layout, ultimately constructing a complete film scene from scratch. Moreover, to enhance cinematic realism and asset diversity, we construct SetDepot-Pro, a curated dataset of 6,862 film-specific 3D assets and 733 materials. Experimental results and human evaluations demonstrate that our system produces structurally sound scenes with strong cinematic fidelity, supporting downstream tasks such as virtual previs, construction drawing and mood board creation.</description>

      <title>TrackNetV5: Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement and Motion Direction Decoupling for Fast Object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02789v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.</description>

      <title>Perceptual Region-Driven Infrared-Visible Co-Fusion for Extreme Scene Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In photogrammetry, accurately fusing infrared (IR) and visible (VIS) spectra while preserving the geometric fidelity of visible features and incorporating thermal radiation is a significant challenge, particularly under extreme conditions. Existing methods often compromise visible imagery quality, impacting measurement accuracy. To solve this, we propose a region perception-based fusion framework that combines multi-exposure and multi-modal imaging using a spatially varying exposure (SVE) camera. This framework co-fuses multi-modal and multi-exposure data, overcoming single-exposure method limitations in extreme environments. The framework begins with region perception-based feature fusion to ensure precise multi-modal registration, followed by adaptive fusion with contrast enhancement. A structural similarity compensation mechanism, guided by regional saliency maps, optimizes IR-VIS spectral integration. Moreover, the framework adapts to single-exposure scenarios for robust fusion across different conditions. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate superior image clarity and improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, as evidenced by both quantitative and visual evaluations.</description>

      <title>Visually Prompted Benchmarks Are Surprisingly Fragile</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key challenge in evaluating VLMs is testing models' ability to analyze visual content independently from their textual priors. Recent benchmarks such as BLINK probe visual perception through visual prompting, where questions about visual content are paired with coordinates to which the question refers, with the coordinates explicitly marked in the image itself. While these benchmarks are an important part of VLM evaluation, we find that existing models are surprisingly fragile to seemingly irrelevant details of visual prompting: simply changing a visual marker from red to blue can completely change rankings among models on a leaderboard. By evaluating nine commonly-used open- and closed-source VLMs on two visually prompted tasks, we demonstrate how details in benchmark setup, including visual marker design and dataset size, have a significant influence on model performance and leaderboard rankings. These effects can even be exploited to lift weaker models above stronger ones; for instance, slightly increasing the size of the visual marker results in open-source InternVL3-8B ranking alongside or better than much larger proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro. We further show that low-level inference choices that are often ignored in benchmarking, such as JPEG compression levels in API calls, can also cause model lineup changes. These details have substantially larger impacts on visually prompted benchmarks than on conventional semantic VLM evaluations.

      <title>PathoSyn: Imaging-Pathology MRI Synthesis via Disentangled Deviation Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present PathoSyn, a unified generative framework for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image synthesis that reformulates imaging-pathology as a disentangled additive deviation on a stable anatomical manifold. Current generative models typically operate in the global pixel domain or rely on binary masks, these paradigms often suffer from feature entanglement, leading to corrupted anatomical substrates or structural discontinuities. PathoSyn addresses these limitations by decomposing the synthesis task into deterministic anatomical reconstruction and stochastic deviation modeling. Central to our framework is a Deviation-Space Diffusion Model designed to learn the conditional distribution of pathological residuals, thereby capturing localized intensity variations while preserving global structural integrity by construction. To ensure spatial coherence, the diffusion process is coupled with a seam-aware fusion strategy and an inference-time stabilization module, which collectively suppress boundary artifacts and produce high-fidelity internal lesion heterogeneity. PathoSyn provides a mathematically principled pipeline for generating high-fidelity patient-specific synthetic datasets, facilitating the development of robust diagnostic algorithms in low-data regimes. By allowing interpretable counterfactual disease progression modeling, the framework supports precision intervention planning and provides a controlled environment for benchmarking clinical decision-support systems. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on tumor imaging benchmarks demonstrate that PathoSyn significantly outperforms holistic diffusion and mask-conditioned baselines in both perceptual realism and anatomical fidelity. The source code of this work will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>RGS-SLAM: Robust Gaussian Splatting SLAM with One-Shot Dense Initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce RGS-SLAM, a robust Gaussian-splatting SLAM framework that replaces the residual-driven densification stage of GS-SLAM with a training-free correspondence-to-Gaussian initialization. Instead of progressively adding Gaussians as residuals reveal missing geometry, RGS-SLAM performs a one-shot triangulation of dense multi-view correspondences derived from DINOv3 descriptors refined through a confidence-aware inlier classifier, generating a well-distributed and structure-aware Gaussian seed prior to optimization. This initialization stabilizes early mapping and accelerates convergence by roughly 20\%, yielding higher rendering fidelity in texture-rich and cluttered scenes while remaining fully compatible with existing GS-SLAM pipelines. Evaluated on the TUM RGB-D and Replica datasets, RGS-SLAM achieves competitive or superior localization and reconstruction accuracy compared with state-of-the-art Gaussian and point-based SLAM systems, sustaining real-time mapping performance at up to 925 FPS.

      <title>Real-Time LiDAR Point Cloud Densification for Low-Latency Spatial Data Transmission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To realize low-latency spatial transmission system for immersive telepresence, there are two major problems: capturing dynamic 3D scene densely and processing them in real time. LiDAR sensors capture 3D in real time, but produce sparce point clouds. Therefore, this paper presents a high-speed LiDAR point cloud densification method to generate dense 3D scene with minimal latency, addressing the need for on-the-fly depth completion while maintaining real-time performance. Our approach combines multiple LiDAR inputs with high-resolution color images and applies a joint bilateral filtering strategy implemented through a convolutional neural network architecture. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method produces dense depth maps at full HD resolution in real time (30 fps), which is over 15x faster than a recent training-based depth completion approach. The resulting dense point clouds exhibit accurate geometry without multiview inconsistencies or ghosting artifacts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalability and data sparsity remain critical bottlenecks for collaborative filtering on massive interaction datasets. This work investigates the latent geometry of user preferences using the MovieLens 32M dataset, implementing a high-performance, parallelized Alternating Least Squares (ALS) framework. Through extensive hyperparameter optimization, we demonstrate that constrained low-rank models significantly outperform higher dimensional counterparts in generalization, achieving an optimal balance between Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and ranking precision. We visualize the learned embedding space to reveal the unsupervised emergence of semantic genre clusters, confirming that the model captures deep structural relationships solely from interaction data. Finally, we validate the system's practical utility in a cold-start scenario, introducing a tunable scoring parameter to manage the trade-off between popularity bias and personalized affinity effectively.

      <title>Apollo: Unified Multi-Task Audio-Video Joint Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio-video joint generation has progressed rapidly, yet substantial challenges still remain. Non-commercial approaches still suffer audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation, which can be stemmed from weak audio-visual correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and scarce high-quality dense-caption data. To address these issues, we introduce Apollo and delve into three axes--model architecture, training strategy, and data curation. Architecturally, we adopt a single-tower design with unified DiT blocks and an Omni-Full Attention mechanism, achieving tight audio-visual alignment and strong scalability. Training-wise, we adopt a progressive multitask regime--random modality masking to joint optimization across tasks, and a multistage curriculum, yielding robust representations, strengthening A-V aligned world knowledge, and preventing unimodal collapse. For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Apollo scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios. Across tasks, it substantially outperforms prior methods by a large margin and achieves performance comparable to Veo 3, offering a unified, scalable path toward next-generation audio-video synthesis.</description>

      <title>Cascading multi-agent anomaly detection in surveillance systems via vision-language models and embedding-based classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent anomaly detection in dynamic visual environments requires reconciling real-time performance with semantic interpretability. Conventional approaches address only fragments of this challenge. Reconstruction-based models capture low-level deviations without contextual reasoning, object detectors provide speed but limited semantics, and large vision-language systems deliver interpretability at prohibitive computational cost. This work introduces a cascading multi-agent framework that unifies these complementary paradigms into a coherent and interpretable architecture. Early modules perform reconstruction-gated filtering and object-level assessment, while higher-level reasoning agents are selectively invoked to interpret semantically ambiguous events. The system employs adaptive escalation thresholds and a publish-subscribe communication backbone, enabling asynchronous coordination and scalable deployment across heterogeneous hardware. Extensive evaluation on large-scale monitoring data demonstrates that the proposed cascade achieves a threefold reduction in latency compared to direct vision-language inference, while maintaining high perceptual fidelity (PSNR = 38.3 dB, SSIM = 0.965) and consistent semantic labeling. The framework advances beyond conventional detection pipelines by combining early-exit efficiency, adaptive multi-agent reasoning, and explainable anomaly attribution, establishing a reproducible and energy-efficient foundation for scalable intelligent visual monitoring.</description>

      <title>Ground What You See: Hallucination-Resistant MLLMs via Caption Feedback, Diversity-Aware Sampling, and Conflict Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse tasks, their practical deployment is severely hindered by hallucination issues, which become particularly acute during Reinforcement Learning (RL) optimization. This paper systematically analyzes the root causes of hallucinations in MLLMs under RL training, identifying three critical factors: (1) an over-reliance on chained visual reasoning, where inaccurate initial descriptions or redundant information anchor subsequent inferences to incorrect premises; (2) insufficient exploration diversity during policy optimization, leading the model to generate overly confident but erroneous outputs; and (3) destructive conflicts between training samples, where Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) similarity causes false associations and unstable parameter updates. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework comprising three core modules. First, we enhance visual localization by introducing dedicated planning and captioning stages before the reasoning phase, employing a quality-based caption reward to ensure accurate initial anchoring. Second, to improve exploration, we categorize samples based on the mean and variance of their reward distributions, prioritizing samples with high variance to focus the model on diverse and informative data. Finally, to mitigate sample interference, we regulate NTK similarity by grouping sample pairs and applying an InfoNCE loss to push overly similar pairs apart and pull dissimilar ones closer, thereby guiding gradient interactions toward a balanced range. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly reduces hallucination rates and effectively enhances the inference accuracy of MLLMs.</description>

      <title>MVGGT: Multimodal Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer for Multiview 3D Referring Expression Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most existing 3D referring expression segmentation (3DRES) methods rely on dense, high-quality point clouds, while real-world agents such as robots and mobile phones operate with only a few sparse RGB views and strict latency constraints. We introduce Multi-view 3D Referring Expression Segmentation (MV-3DRES), where the model must recover scene structure and segment the referred object directly from sparse multi-view images. Traditional two-stage pipelines, which first reconstruct a point cloud and then perform segmentation, often yield low-quality geometry, produce coarse or degraded target regions, and run slowly. We propose the Multimodal Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (MVGGT), an efficient end-to-end framework that integrates language information into sparse-view geometric reasoning through a dual-branch design. Training in this setting exposes a critical optimization barrier, termed Foreground Gradient Dilution (FGD), where sparse 3D signals lead to weak supervision. To resolve this, we introduce Per-view No-target Suppression Optimization (PVSO), which provides stronger and more balanced gradients across views, enabling stable and efficient learning. To support consistent evaluation, we build MVRefer, a benchmark that defines standardized settings and metrics for MV-3DRES. Experiments show that MVGGT establishes the first strong baseline and achieves both high accuracy and fast inference, outperforming existing alternatives.

      <title>ViewMorpher3D: A 3D-aware Diffusion Framework for Multi-Camera Novel View Synthesis in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on multi-view images to ensure accurate perception and robust decision-making. To effectively develop and evaluate perception stacks and planning algorithms, realistic closed-loop simulators are indispensable. While 3D reconstruction techniques such as Gaussian Splatting offer promising avenues for simulator construction, the rendered novel views often exhibit artifacts, particularly in extrapolated perspectives or when available observations are sparse.
  We introduce ViewMorpher3D, a multi-view image enhancement framework based on image diffusion models, designed to elevate photorealism and multi-view coherence in driving scenes. Unlike single-view approaches, ViewMorpher3D jointly processes a set of rendered views conditioned on camera poses, 3D geometric priors, and temporally adjacent or spatially overlapping reference views. This enables the model to infer missing details, suppress rendering artifacts, and enforce cross-view consistency.
  Our framework accommodates variable numbers of cameras and flexible reference/target view configurations, making it adaptable to diverse sensor setups. Experiments on real-world driving datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in image quality metrics, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving geometric fidelity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present RefVFX, a new framework that transfers complex temporal effects from a reference video onto a target video or image in a feed-forward manner. While existing methods excel at prompt-based or keyframe-conditioned editing, they struggle with dynamic temporal effects such as dynamic lighting changes or character transformations, which are difficult to describe via text or static conditions. Transferring a video effect is challenging, as the model must integrate the new temporal dynamics with the input video's existing motion and appearance. % To address this, we introduce a large-scale dataset of triplets, where each triplet consists of a reference effect video, an input image or video, and a corresponding output video depicting the transferred effect. Creating this data is non-trivial, especially the video-to-video effect triplets, which do not exist naturally. To generate these, we propose a scalable automated pipeline that creates high-quality paired videos designed to preserve the input's motion and structure while transforming it based on some fixed, repeatable effect. We then augment this data with image-to-video effects derived from LoRA adapters and code-based temporal effects generated through programmatic composition. Building on our new dataset, we train our reference-conditioned model using recent text-to-video backbones. Experimental results demonstrate that RefVFX produces visually consistent and temporally coherent edits, generalizes across unseen effect categories, and outperforms prompt-only baselines in both quantitative metrics and human preference.

Abstract: Single image super-resolution (SISR) has played an important role in the field of image processing. Recent generative adversarial networks (GANs) can achieve excellent results on low-resolution images. However, there are little literatures summarizing different GANs in SISR. In this paper, we conduct a comparative study of GANs from different perspectives. We begin by surveying the development of GANs and popular GAN variants for image-related applications, and then analyze motivations, implementations and differences of GANs based optimization methods and discriminative learning for image super-resolution in terms of supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised manners, where these GANs are analyzed via integrating different network architectures, prior knowledge, loss functions and multiple tasks. Secondly, we compare the performances of these popular GANs on public datasets via quantitative and qualitative analysis in SISR. Finally, we highlight challenges of GANs and potential research points for SISR.</description>

Abstract: Challenges persist in providing interpretable explanations for neural network reasoning in explainable AI (xAI). Existing methods like Integrated Gradients produce noisy maps, and LIME, while intuitive, may deviate from the model's reasoning. We introduce a framework that uses hierarchical segmentation techniques for faithful and interpretable explanations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our method constructs model-based hierarchical segmentations that maintain the model's reasoning fidelity and allows both human-centric and model-centric segmentation. This approach offers multiscale explanations, aiding bias identification and enhancing understanding of neural network decision-making. Experiments show that our framework, xAiTrees, delivers highly interpretable and faithful model explanations, not only surpassing traditional xAI methods but shedding new light on a novel approach to enhancing xAI interpretability.</description>

Abstract: Deep learning has led to tremendous success in computer vision, largely due to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, CNNs have been shown to be vulnerable to crafted adversarial perturbations. This vulnerability of adversarial examples has has motivated research into improving model robustness through adversarial detection and defense methods. In this paper, we address the adversarial robustness of CNNs through causal reasoning. We propose CausAdv: a causal framework for detecting adversarial examples based on counterfactual reasoning. CausAdv learns both causal and non-causal features of every input, and quantifies the counterfactual information (CI) of every filter of the last convolutional layer. We then perform a statistical analysis of the filters' CI across clean and adversarial samples, to demonstrate that adversarial examples exhibit different CI distributions compared to clean samples. Our results show that causal reasoning enhances the process of adversarial detection without the need to train a separate detector. Moreover, we illustrate the efficiency of causal explanations as a helpful detection tool by visualizing the extracted causal features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the deformability of garments, generating a large amount of high-quality data for robotic garment manipulation tasks is highly challenging. In this paper, we present a synthetic garment dataset that can be used for robotic garment folding. We begin by constructing geometric garment templates based on keypoints and applying generative models to generate realistic texture patterns. Leveraging these keypoint annotations, we generate folding demonstrations in simulation and train folding policies via closed-loop imitation learning. To improve robustness, we propose KG-DAgger, which uses a keypoint-based strategy to generate demonstration data for recovering from failures. KG-DAgger significantly improves the model performance, boosting the real-world success rate by 25\%. After training with 15K trajectories (about 2M image-action pairs), the model achieves a 75\% success rate in the real world. Experiments in both simulation and real-world settings validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>A Pre-trained Foundation Model Framework for Multiplanar MRI Classification of Extramural Vascular Invasion and Mesorectal Fascia Invasion in Rectal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objectives Accurate MRI-based identification of extramural vascular invasion (EVI) and mesorectal fascia invasion (MFI) is crucial for risk-stratified rectal cancer treatment. However, subjective visual assessment and inter-institutional variability limit diagnostic consistency. This study developed and externally evaluated a multi-centre, foundation model-driven framework that automatically classifies EVI and MFI on axial and sagittal MRI. Methods A total of 331 pre-treatment rectal cancer T2-weighted MRI scans from three European hospitals were retrospectively recruited. A self-supervised frequency domain harmonization strategy was applied to reduce scanner variability. Three classifiers, SeResNet, the universal biomedical pretrained model (UMedPT) with a multilayer perceptron head, and a logistic-regression variant using frozen UMedPT features (UMedPT_LR), were trained (n=265) and tested (n=66). Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) visualized model predictions. Results UMedPT_LR achieved the best EVI performance with multiplanar fusion (AUC=0.82, test set). For MFI, UMedPT trained on axial harmonized images yielded the highest performance (AUC = 0.77). Both tasks outperformed the CHAIMELEON 2024 benchmark (EVI: 0.82 vs 0.74; MFI: 0.77 vs 0.75). Harmonization enhanced MFI classification, and multiplanar fusion further boosted EVI performance. Grad-CAM confirmed biologically plausible attention on peritumoral regions (EVI) and mesorectal fascia margins (MFI). Conclusion The proposed foundation model-driven framework, leveraging frequency domain harmonization and multiplanar fusion, achieves state-of-the-art performance for automated EVI and MFI classification on MRI, demonstrating strong generalizability across multiple centers.</description>

      <title>Semi-Tensor-Product Based Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The semi-tensor product of vectors generalizes the conventional inner product, enabling algebraic operations between vectors of different dimensions. Building upon this foundation, we introduce a domain-based convolutional product and integrate it with the STP to formulate a padding-free convolutional operation. This new operation inherently avoids zero or other artificial padding, thereby eliminating redundant information and boundary artifacts commonly present in conventional convolutional neural networks. Based on this operation, we further develop an STP-based CNN framework that extends convolutional computation to irregular and cross-dimensional data domains. Applications to image processing and third-order signal identification demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness in handling irregular, incomplete, and high-dimensional data without the distortions caused by padding.</description>

      <title>Quantization-Aware Neuromorphic Architecture for Skin Disease Classification on Resource-Constrained Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-device skin lesion analysis is constrained by the compute and energy cost of conventional CNN inference and by the need to update models as new patient data become available. We propose QANA, a quantization-aware CNN backbone embedded in an end-to-end pipeline engineered for conversion-stable neuromorphic execution. QANA replaces conversion-fragile components with spike-compatible transformations by bounding intermediate activations and aligning normalization with low-bit quantization, reducing conversion-induced distortion that disproportionately impacts rare classes. Efficiency is achieved through Ghost-based feature generation under tight FLOP budgets, while spatially-aware efficient channel attention and squeeze-and-excitation recalibrate channels without heavy global operators that are difficult to map to spiking cores. The resulting quantized projection head produces SNN-ready logits and enables incremental updates on edge hardware without full retraining or data offloading. On HAM10000, QANA achieves 91.6% Top-1 accuracy and 91.0% macro F1, improving the strongest converted SNN baseline by 3.5 percentage points in Top-1 accuracy, corresponding to a 4.0% relative gain, and by 12.0 points in macro F1, corresponding to a 15.2% relative gain. On a clinical dataset, QANA achieves 90.8% Top-1 accuracy and 81.7% macro F1, improving the strongest converted SNN baseline by 3.2 points in Top-1 accuracy, which corresponds to a 3.7% relative gain, and by 3.6 points in macro F1, corresponding to a 4.6% relative gain. When deployed on BrainChip Akida, QANA runs in 1.5 ms per image with 1.7 mJ per image, corresponding to 94.6% lower latency and 99.0% lower energy than its GPU-based CNN implementation.</description>

      <title>MoHoBench: Assessing Honesty of Multimodal Large Language Models via Unanswerable Visual Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21503v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable advancements in vision-language tasks, yet produce potentially harmful or untrustworthy content. Despite substantial work investigating the trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly, especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark, consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs. Our data and code can be found at https://github.com/yanxuzhu/MoHoBench.</description>

      <title>MixGRPO: Unlocking Flow-based GRPO Efficiency with Mixed ODE-SDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21802v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO and DanceGRPO still exhibit inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose $\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence. Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for faster sampling. So we present a faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment, outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50% lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by 71%.</description>

      <title>HiFi-Mamba: Dual-Stream W-Laplacian Enhanced Mamba for High-Fidelity MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data remains a challenging problem in MRI. While Mamba variants for vision tasks offer promising long-range modeling capabilities with linear-time complexity, their direct application to MRI reconstruction inherits two key limitations: (1) insensitivity to high-frequency anatomical details; and (2) reliance on redundant multi-directional scanning. To address these limitations, we introduce High-Fidelity Mamba (HiFi-Mamba), a novel dual-stream Mamba-based architecture comprising stacked W-Laplacian (WL) and HiFi-Mamba blocks. Specifically, the WL block performs fidelity-preserving spectral decoupling, producing complementary low- and high-frequency streams. This separation enables the HiFi-Mamba block to focus on low-frequency structures, enhancing global feature modeling. Concurrently, the HiFi-Mamba block selectively integrates high-frequency features through adaptive state-space modulation, preserving comprehensive spectral details. To eliminate the scanning redundancy, the HiFi-Mamba block adopts a streamlined unidirectional traversal strategy that preserves long-range modeling capability with improved computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on standard MRI reconstruction benchmarks demonstrate that HiFi-Mamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CNN-based, Transformer-based, and other Mamba-based models in reconstruction accuracy while maintaining a compact and efficient model design.</description>

      <title>Layer-Wise Anomaly Detection in Directed Energy Deposition using High-Fidelity Fringe Projection Profilometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Directed energy deposition (DED), a metal additive manufacturing process, is highly susceptible to process-induced defects such as geometric deviations, lack of fusion, and poor surface finish. This work presents a build-height-synchronized fringe projection system for in-situ, layer-wise surface reconstruction of laser-DED components, achieving a reconstruction accuracy of ${\pm}$46 ${\mu}$m. From the reconstructed 3D morphology, two complementary geometry-based point cloud metrics are introduced: local point density, which highlights poor surface finish, and normal-change rate, which identifies lack-of-fusion features. These methods enable automated, annotation-free identification of common deposition anomalies directly from reconstructed surfaces, without the need for manual labeling. By directly linking geometric deviation to defect formation, the approach enables precise anomaly localization and advances the feasibility of closed-loop process control. This work establishes fringe projection as a practical tool for micrometer-scale monitoring in DED, bridging the gap between process signatures and part geometry for certifiable additive manufacturing.</description>

      <title>UNCAP: Uncertainty-Guided Neurosymbolic Planning Using Natural Language Communication for Cooperative Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safe large-scale coordination of multiple cooperative connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) hinges on communication that is both efficient and interpretable. Existing approaches either rely on transmitting high-bandwidth raw sensor data streams or neglect perception and planning uncertainties inherent in shared data, resulting in systems that are neither scalable nor safe. To address these limitations, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Natural Language Cooperative Autonomous Planning (UNCAP), a vision-language model-based planning approach that enables CAVs to communicate via lightweight natural language messages while explicitly accounting for perception uncertainty in decision-making. UNCAP features a two-stage communication protocol: (i) an ego CAV first identifies the subset of vehicles most relevant for information exchange, and (ii) the selected CAVs then transmit messages that quantitatively express their perception uncertainty. By selectively fusing messages that maximize mutual information, this strategy allows the ego vehicle to integrate only the most relevant signals into its decision-making, improving both the scalability and reliability of cooperative planning. Experiments across diverse driving scenarios show a 63% reduction in communication bandwidth with a 31% increase in driving safety score, a 61% reduction in decision uncertainty, and a four-fold increase in collision distance margin during near-miss events.

      <title>Aligning by Misaligning: Boundary-aware Curriculum Learning for Multimodal Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most multimodal models treat every negative pair alike, ignoring the ambiguous negatives that differ from the positive by only a small detail. We propose Boundary-Aware Curriculum with Local Attention (BACL), a lightweight add-on that turns these borderline cases into a curriculum signal. A Boundary-aware Negative Sampler gradually raises difficulty, while a Contrastive Local Attention loss highlights where the mismatch occurs. The two modules are fully differentiable and work with any off-the-shelf dual encoder. Theory predicts a fast O(1/n) error rate; practice shows up to +32% R@1 over CLIP and new SOTA on four large-scale benchmarks, all without extra labels.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Visual World with Artificial Intelligence: A Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The landscape of video generation is shifting, from a focus on generating visually appealing clips to building virtual environments that support interaction and maintain physical plausibility. These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a "window" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems.

      <title>SpatialActor: Exploring Disentangled Spatial Representations for Robust Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation requires precise spatial understanding to interact with objects in the real world. Point-based methods suffer from sparse sampling, leading to the loss of fine-grained semantics. Image-based methods typically feed RGB and depth into 2D backbones pre-trained on 3D auxiliary tasks, but their entangled semantics and geometry are sensitive to inherent depth noise in real-world that disrupts semantic understanding. Moreover, these methods focus on high-level geometry while overlooking low-level spatial cues essential for precise interaction. We propose SpatialActor, a disentangled framework for robust robotic manipulation that explicitly decouples semantics and geometry. The Semantic-guided Geometric Module adaptively fuses two complementary geometry from noisy depth and semantic-guided expert priors. Also, a Spatial Transformer leverages low-level spatial cues for accurate 2D-3D mapping and enables interaction among spatial features. We evaluate SpatialActor on multiple simulation and real-world scenarios across 50+ tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with 87.4% on RLBench and improves by 13.9% to 19.4% under varying noisy conditions, showing strong robustness. Moreover, it significantly enhances few-shot generalization to new tasks and maintains robustness under various spatial perturbations.

      <title>Generative Digital Twins: Vision-Language Simulation Models for Executable Industrial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20387v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Vision-Language Simulation Model (VLSM) that unifies visual and textual understanding to synthesize executable FlexScript from layout sketches and natural-language prompts, enabling cross-modal reasoning for industrial simulation systems. To support this new paradigm, the study constructs the first large-scale dataset for generative digital twins, comprising over 120,000 prompt-sketch-code triplets that enable multimodal learning between textual descriptions, spatial structures, and simulation logic. In parallel, three novel evaluation metrics, Structural Validity Rate (SVR), Parameter Match Rate (PMR), and Execution Success Rate (ESR), are proposed specifically for this task to comprehensively evaluate structural integrity, parameter fidelity, and simulator executability. Through systematic ablation across vision encoders, connectors, and code-pretrained language backbones, the proposed models achieve near-perfect structural accuracy and high execution robustness. This work establishes a foundation for generative digital twins that integrate visual reasoning and language understanding into executable industrial simulation systems.

      <title>A Vision for Multisensory Intelligence: Sensing, Science, and Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our experience of the world is multisensory, spanning a synthesis of language, sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. Yet, artificial intelligence has primarily advanced in digital modalities like text, vision, and audio. This paper outlines a research vision for multisensory artificial intelligence over the next decade. This new set of technologies can change how humans and AI experience and interact with one another, by connecting AI to the human senses and a rich spectrum of signals from physiological and tactile cues on the body, to physical and social signals in homes, cities, and the environment. We outline how this field must advance through three interrelated themes of sensing, science, and synergy. Firstly, research in sensing should extend how AI captures the world in richer ways beyond the digital medium. Secondly, developing a principled science for quantifying multimodal heterogeneity and interactions, developing unified modeling architectures and representations, and understanding cross-modal transfer. Finally, we present new technical challenges to learn synergy between modalities and between humans and AI, covering multisensory integration, alignment, reasoning, generation, generalization, and experience. Accompanying this vision paper are a series of projects, resources, and demos of latest advances from the Multisensory Intelligence group at the MIT Media Lab, see https://mit-mi.github.io/.</description>
