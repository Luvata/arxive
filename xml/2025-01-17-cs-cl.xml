      <title>MERaLiON-TextLLM: Cross-Lingual Understanding of Large Language Models in Chinese, Indonesian, Malay, and Singlish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across a variety of languages. However, efficacy can differ greatly between different language families, especially for those with limited linguistic resources. This report presents MERaLiON-TextLLM, a series of open-source language models specifically tailored to improve understanding and generation in Chinese, Indonesian, Malay, and Singlish. The initial released model is built on Llama-3-8B-Base and refined through a meticulously crafted process of continued pre-training and weight merging. Our approach achieves performance improvements across benchmarks in these languages, exceeding the capabilities of the official Llama-3 models. We provide the model checkpoints as a resource to support further research and development in cross-lingual language understanding.</description>

      <title>Ensemble of Large Language Models for Curated Labeling and Rating of Free-text Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-text responses are commonly collected in psychological studies, providing rich qualitative insights that quantitative measures may not capture. Labeling curated topics of research interest in free-text data by multiple trained human coders is typically labor-intensive and time-consuming. Though large language models (LLMs) excel in language processing, LLM-assisted labeling techniques relying on closed-source LLMs cannot be directly applied to free-text data, without explicit consent for external use.
  In this study, we propose a framework of assembling locally-deployable LLMs to enhance the labeling of predetermined topics in free-text data under privacy constraints. Analogous to annotation by multiple human raters, this framework leverages the heterogeneity of diverse open-source LLMs. The ensemble approach seeks a balance between the agreement and disagreement across LLMs, guided by a relevancy scoring methodology that utilizes embedding distances between topic descriptions and LLMs' reasoning. We evaluated the ensemble approach using both publicly accessible Reddit data from eating disorder related forums, and free-text responses from eating disorder patients, both complemented by human annotations.
  We found that: (1) there is heterogeneity in the performance of labeling among same-sized LLMs, with some showing low sensitivity but high precision, while others exhibit high sensitivity but low precision. (2) Compared to individual LLMs, the ensemble of LLMs achieved the highest accuracy and optimal precision-sensitivity trade-off in predicting human annotations. (3) The relevancy scores across LLMs showed greater agreement than dichotomous labels, indicating that the relevancy scoring method effectively mitigates the heterogeneity in LLMs' labeling.</description>

      <title>Religious Bias Landscape in Language and Text-to-Image Models: Analysis, Detection, and Debiasing Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Note: This paper includes examples of potentially offensive content related to religious bias, presented solely for academic purposes. The widespread adoption of language models highlights the need for critical examinations of their inherent biases, particularly concerning religion. This study systematically investigates religious bias in both language models and text-to-image generation models, analyzing both open-source and closed-source systems. We construct approximately 400 unique, naturally occurring prompts to probe language models for religious bias across diverse tasks, including mask filling, prompt completion, and image generation. Our experiments reveal concerning instances of underlying stereotypes and biases associated disproportionately with certain religions. Additionally, we explore cross-domain biases, examining how religious bias intersects with demographic factors such as gender, age, and nationality. This study further evaluates the effectiveness of targeted debiasing techniques by employing corrective prompts designed to mitigate the identified biases. Our findings demonstrate that language models continue to exhibit significant biases in both text and image generation tasks, emphasizing the urgent need to develop fairer language models to achieve global acceptability.</description>

      <title>Jochre 3 and the Yiddish OCR corpus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the construction of a publicly available Yiddish OCR Corpus, and describe and evaluate the open source OCR tool suite Jochre 3, including an Alto editor for corpus annotation, OCR software for Alto OCR layer generation, and a customizable OCR search engine. The current version of the Yiddish OCR corpus contains 658 pages, 186K tokens and 840K glyphs. The Jochre 3 OCR tool uses various fine-tuned YOLOv8 models for top-down page layout analysis, and a custom CNN network for glyph recognition. It attains a CER of 1.5% on our test corpus, far out-performing all other existing public models for Yiddish. We analyzed the full 660M word Yiddish Book Center with Jochre 3 OCR, and the new OCR is searchable through the Yiddish Book Center OCR search engine.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models For Text Classification: Case Study And Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlocking the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in data classification represents a promising frontier in natural language processing. In this work, we evaluate the performance of different LLMs in comparison with state-of-the-art deep-learning and machine-learning models, in two different classification scenarios: i) the classification of employees' working locations based on job reviews posted online (multiclass classification), and 2) the classification of news articles as fake or not (binary classification). Our analysis encompasses a diverse range of language models differentiating in size, quantization, and architecture. We explore the impact of alternative prompting techniques and evaluate the models based on the weighted F1-score. Also, we examine the trade-off between performance (F1-score) and time (inference response time) for each language model to provide a more nuanced understanding of each model's practical applicability. Our work reveals significant variations in model responses based on the prompting strategies. We find that LLMs, particularly Llama3 and GPT-4, can outperform traditional methods in complex classification tasks, such as multiclass classification, though at the cost of longer inference times. In contrast, simpler ML models offer better performance-to-time trade-offs in simpler binary classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Selective Attention Merging for low resource tasks: A case study of Child ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Speech Foundation Models (SFMs) excel in various speech tasks, their performance for low-resource tasks such as child Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is hampered by limited pretraining data. To address this, we explore different model merging techniques to leverage knowledge from models trained on larger, more diverse speech corpora. This paper also introduces Selective Attention (SA) Merge, a novel method that selectively merges task vectors from attention matrices to enhance SFM performance on low-resource tasks. Experiments on the MyST database show significant reductions in relative word error rate of up to 14%, outperforming existing model merging and data augmentation techniques. By combining data augmentation techniques with SA Merge, we achieve a new state-of-the-art WER of 8.69 on the MyST database for the Whisper-small model, highlighting the potential of SA Merge for improving low-resource ASR.</description>

      <title>The Theater Stage as Laboratory: Review of Real-Time Comedy LLM Systems for Live Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this position paper, we review the eclectic recent history of academic and artistic works involving computational systems for humor generation, and focus specifically on live performance. We make the case that AI comedy should be evaluated in live conditions, in front of audiences sharing either physical or online spaces, and under real-time constraints. We further suggest that improvised comedy is therefore the perfect substrate for deploying and assessing computational humor systems. Using examples of successful AI-infused shows, we demonstrate that live performance raises three sets of challenges for computational humor generation: 1) questions around robotic embodiment, anthropomorphism and competition between humans and machines, 2) questions around comedic timing and the nature of audience interaction, and 3) questions about the human interpretation of seemingly absurd AI-generated humor. We argue that these questions impact the choice of methodologies for evaluating computational humor, as any such method needs to work around the constraints of live audiences and performance spaces. These interrogations also highlight different types of collaborative relationship of human comedians towards AI tools.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Importance of Data Alignment in Downstream Model Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrary to the conventional emphasis on dataset size, we explore the role of data alignment -- an often overlooked aspect of data quality -- in training capable Large Language Models (LLMs). To do so, we use the Task2Vec-based alignment coefficient, a quantitative measure of the similarity between two datasets, to quantify the impact of alignment between training data and evaluation data on downstream performance. In particular, we conduct controlled \textit{interventional} experiments for two settings: 1. the impact of increased alignment coefficients between various pre-training (pt) against evaluation datasets, and 2. the impact of increased alignment coefficients between domain specific fine-tuning (ft) against domain specific evaluation. The domain specific task we explore is Autoformalization -- the machine translation task between natural language and code for formal verification. In both settings, we find a strong, predictable negative correlation between the alignment coefficient of a model's training and evaluation data and the model's loss/perplexity on the respective downstream task. These findings suggest a re-evaluation of LLM training approaches, demonstrating the relevance of data alignment compared to data quantity, especially in specialized downstream tasks such as Autoformalization.</description>

      <title>Adapting Whisper for Regional Dialects: Enhancing Public Services for Vulnerable Populations in the United Kingdom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We collect novel data in the public service domain to evaluate the capability of the state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) models in capturing regional differences in accents in the United Kingdom (UK), specifically focusing on two accents from Scotland with distinct dialects. This study addresses real-world problems where biased ASR models can lead to miscommunication in public services, disadvantaging individuals with regional accents particularly those in vulnerable populations. We first examine the out-of-the-box performance of the Whisper large-v3 model on a baseline dataset and our data. We then explore the impact of fine-tuning Whisper on the performance in the two UK regions and investigate the effectiveness of existing model evaluation techniques for our real-world application through manual inspection of model errors. We observe that the Whisper model has a higher word error rate (WER) on our test datasets compared to the baseline data and fine-tuning on a given data improves performance on the test dataset with the same domain and accent. The fine-tuned models also appear to show improved performance when applied to the test data outside of the region it was trained on suggesting that fine-tuned models may be transferable within parts of the UK. Our manual analysis of model outputs reveals the benefits and drawbacks of using WER as an evaluation metric and fine-tuning to adapt to regional dialects.</description>

      <title>Doc-Guided Sent2Sent++: A Sent2Sent++ Agent with Doc-Guided memory for Document-level Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of artificial intelligence has witnessed significant advancements in natural language processing, largely attributed to the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). These models form the backbone of Agents designed to address long-context dependencies, particularly in Document-level Machine Translation (DocMT). DocMT presents unique challenges, with quality, consistency, and fluency being the key metrics for evaluation. Existing approaches, such as Doc2Doc and Doc2Sent, either omit sentences or compromise fluency. This paper introduces Doc-Guided Sent2Sent++, an Agent that employs an incremental sentence-level forced decoding strategy \textbf{to ensure every sentence is translated while enhancing the fluency of adjacent sentences.} Our Agent leverages a Doc-Guided Memory, focusing solely on the summary and its translation, which we find to be an efficient approach to maintaining consistency. Through extensive testing across multiple languages and domains, we demonstrate that Sent2Sent++ outperforms other methods in terms of quality, consistency, and fluency. The results indicate that, our approach has achieved significant improvements in metrics such as s-COMET, d-COMET, LTCR-$1_f$, and document-level perplexity (d-ppl). The contributions of this paper include a detailed analysis of current DocMT research, the introduction of the Sent2Sent++ decoding method, the Doc-Guided Memory mechanism, and validation of its effectiveness across languages and domains.</description>

      <title>Complexity Control Facilitates Reasoning-Based Compositional Generalization in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various tasks, yet their performance on compositional problems remains a subject of debate. In this study, we investigate the internal mechanisms underlying Transformers' behavior in compositional tasks. We find that complexity control strategies significantly influence whether the model learns primitive-level rules that generalize out-of-distribution (reasoning-based solutions) or relies solely on memorized mappings (memory-based solutions). By applying masking strategies to the model's information circuits and employing multiple complexity metrics, we reveal distinct internal working mechanisms associated with different solution types. Further analysis reveals that reasoning-based solutions exhibit a lower complexity bias, which aligns with the well-studied neuron condensation phenomenon. This lower complexity bias is hypothesized to be the key factor enabling these solutions to learn reasoning rules. We validate these conclusions across multiple real-world datasets, including image generation and natural language processing tasks, confirming the broad applicability of our findings.</description>

      <title>Knowledge prompt chaining for semantic modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of building semantics for structured data such as CSV, JSON, and XML files is highly relevant in the knowledge representation field. Even though we have a vast of structured data on the internet, mapping them to domain ontologies to build semantics for them is still very challenging as it requires the construction model to understand and learn graph-structured knowledge. Otherwise, the task will require human beings' effort and cost. In this paper, we proposed a novel automatic semantic modeling framework: Knowledge Prompt Chaining. It can serialize the graph-structured knowledge and inject it into the LLMs properly in a Prompt Chaining architecture. Through this knowledge injection and prompting chaining, the model in our framework can learn the structure information and latent space of the graph and generate the semantic labels and semantic graphs following the chains' insturction naturally. Based on experimental results, our method achieves better performance than existing leading techniques, despite using reduced structured input data.</description>

      <title>Information Entropy Invariance: Enhancing Length Extrapolation in Attention Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the length extrapolation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge in natural language processing. Many recent efforts have focused on modifying the scaled dot-product attention mechanism, and often introduce scaled temperatures without rigorous theoretical justification. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel approach based on information entropy invariance. We propose two new scaled temperatures to enhance length extrapolation. First, a training-free method InfoScale is designed for dot-product attention, and preserves focus on original tokens during length extrapolation by ensuring information entropy remains consistent. Second, we theoretically analyze the impact of scaling (CosScale) on cosine attention. Experimental data demonstrates that combining InfoScale and CosScale achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GAU-{\alpha} model with a context window extended to 64 times the training length, and outperforms seven existing methods. Our analysis reveals that significantly increasing CosScale approximates windowed attention, and highlights the significance of attention score dilution as a key challenge in long-range context handling. The code and data are available at https://github.com/HT-NEKO/InfoScale.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that advancing LLM-based human simulation requires addressing both LLM's inherent limitations and simulation framework design challenges. Recent studies have revealed significant gaps between LLM-based human simulations and real-world observations, highlighting these dual challenges. To address these gaps, we present a comprehensive analysis of LLM limitations and our design issues, proposing targeted solutions for both aspects. Furthermore, we explore future directions that address both challenges simultaneously, particularly in data collection, LLM generation, and evaluation. To support further research in this field, we provide a curated collection of LLM-based human simulation resources.\footnote{https://github.com/Persdre/llm-human-simulation}</description>

      <title>LoRS: Efficient Low-Rank Adaptation for Sparse Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing low-rank adaptation (LoRA) methods face challenges on sparse large language models (LLMs) due to the inability to maintain sparsity. Recent works introduced methods that maintain sparsity by augmenting LoRA techniques with additional masking mechanisms. Despite these successes, such approaches suffer from an increased memory and computation overhead, which affects efficiency of LoRA methods. In response to this limitation, we introduce LoRS, an innovative method designed to achieve both memory and computation efficiency when fine-tuning sparse LLMs. To mitigate the substantial memory and computation demands associated with preserving sparsity, our approach incorporates strategies of weight recompute and computational graph rearrangement. In addition, we also improve the effectiveness of LoRS through better adapter initialization. These innovations lead to a notable reduction in memory and computation consumption during the fine-tuning phase, all while achieving performance levels that outperform existing LoRA approaches.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Knowledge Integration for Enhanced Vision-Language Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in multimodal tasks, but their performance is often constrained by the lack of external knowledge integration, limiting their ability to handle knowledge-intensive tasks such as visual question answering and reasoning. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method, Adaptive Knowledge-Guided Pretraining for Large Vision-Language Models (AKGP-LVLM), which dynamically incorporates structured and unstructured knowledge into LVLMs during pretraining and fine-tuning. Our approach employs a knowledge encoder to represent external knowledge, a retrieval mechanism to select task-relevant information, and a dynamic adaptor to align multimodal and knowledge representations effectively. We evaluate our method on four benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, human evaluations highlight the superior correctness and relevance of our model's outputs. Extensive analyses confirm the robustness, efficiency, and scalability of AKGP-LVLM, making it a compelling solution for real-world knowledge-intensive tasks.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Alignment of FOL Closeness Metrics with Human Judgement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent successful paradigm of solving logical reasoning problems with tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) leverages translation of natural language statements into First-Order Logic~(FOL) and external theorem provers. However, the correctness of FOL statements, comprising operators and text predicates, often goes unverified due to the lack of a reliable evaluation metric for comparing generated and ground-truth FOLs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of sensitivity of existing metrics and their alignment with human judgement on FOL evaluation. Using ground-truth FOLs, we carefully designed various perturbations on the ground-truth to assess metric sensitivity. We sample FOL translation candidates for natural language statements and measure the ranking alignment between automatic metrics and human annotators. Our empirical findings highlight oversensitivity in the n-gram metric BLEU for text perturbations, the semantic graph metric Smatch++ for structural perturbations, and FOL metric for operator perturbation. We also observe a closer alignment between BertScore and human judgement. Additionally, we show that combining metrics enhances both alignment and sensitivity compared to using individual metrics.</description>

      <title>Disjoint Processing Mechanisms of Hierarchical and Linear Grammars in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All natural languages are structured hierarchically. In humans, this structural restriction is neurologically coded: when two grammars are presented with identical vocabularies, brain areas responsible for language processing are only sensitive to hierarchical grammars. Using large language models (LLMs), we investigate whether such functionally distinct hierarchical processing regions can arise solely from exposure to large-scale language distributions. We generate inputs using English, Italian, Japanese, or nonce words, varying the underlying grammars to conform to either hierarchical or linear/positional rules. Using these grammars, we first observe that language models show distinct behaviors on hierarchical versus linearly structured inputs. Then, we find that the components responsible for processing hierarchical grammars are distinct from those that process linear grammars; we causally verify this in ablation experiments. Finally, we observe that hierarchy-selective components are also active on nonce grammars; this suggests that hierarchy sensitivity is not tied to meaning, nor in-distribution inputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an results of the VLSP 2022-2023 Machine Translation Shared Tasks, focusing on Vietnamese-Chinese and Vietnamese-Lao machine translation. The tasks were organized as part of the 9th, 10th annual workshop on Vietnamese Language and Speech Processing (VLSP 2022, VLSP 2023). The objective of the shared task was to build machine translation systems, specifically targeting Vietnamese-Chinese and Vietnamese-Lao translation (corresponding to 4 translation directions). The submission were evaluated on 1,000 pairs for testing (news and general domains) using established metrics like BLEU [11] and SacreBLEU [12]. Additionally, system outputs also were evaluated with human judgment provided by experts in Chinese and Lao languages. These human assessments played a crucial role in ranking the performance of the machine translation models, ensuring a more comprehensive evaluation.</description>

      <title>Reassessing the Role of Chain-of-Thought in Sentiment Analysis: Insights and Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between language and thought remains an unresolved philosophical issue. Existing viewpoints can be broadly categorized into two schools: one asserting their independence, and another arguing that language constrains thought. In the context of large language models, this debate raises a crucial question: Does a language model's grasp of semantic meaning depend on thought processes? To explore this issue, we investigate whether reasoning techniques can facilitate semantic understanding. Specifically, we conceptualize thought as reasoning, employ chain-of-thought prompting as a reasoning technique, and examine its impact on sentiment analysis tasks. The experiments show that chain-of-thought has a minimal impact on sentiment analysis tasks. Both the standard and chain-of-thought prompts focus on aspect terms rather than sentiment in the generated content. Furthermore, counterfactual experiments reveal that the model's handling of sentiment tasks primarily depends on information from demonstrations. The experimental results support the first viewpoint.</description>

      <title>MAGNET: Augmenting Generative Decoders with Representation Learning and Infilling Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While originally designed for unidirectional generative modeling, decoder-only large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adapted for bidirectional modeling. However, unidirectional and bidirectional models are typically trained separately with distinct objectives (generation and representation learning, respectively). This separation overlooks the opportunity for developing a more versatile language model and for these objectives to complement each other. In this work, we introduce MAGNET, an adaptation of decoder-only LLMs that enhances their ability to generate robust representations and infill missing text spans, while preserving their knowledge and text generation capabilities. MAGNET employs three self-supervised training objectives and introduces an attention mechanism that combines bidirectional and causal attention, enabling unified training across all objectives. Our results demonstrate that LLMs adapted with MAGNET (1) surpass strong text encoders on token-level and sentence-level representation learning tasks, (2) generate contextually appropriate text infills by leveraging future context, (3) retain the ability for open-ended text generation without exhibiting repetition problem, and (4) preserve the knowledge gained by the LLM during pretraining.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Feature Fusion for Emotion Analysis and Suicide Risk Differentiation in Chinese Psychological Support Hotlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mental health is a critical global public health issue, and psychological support hotlines play a pivotal role in providing mental health assistance and identifying suicide risks at an early stage. However, the emotional expressions conveyed during these calls remain underexplored in current research. This study introduces a method that combines pitch acoustic features with deep learning-based features to analyze and understand emotions expressed during hotline interactions. Using data from China's largest psychological support hotline, our method achieved an F1-score of 79.13% for negative binary emotion classification.Additionally, the proposed approach was validated on an open dataset for multi-class emotion classification,where it demonstrated better performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. To explore its clinical relevance, we applied the model to analysis the frequency of negative emotions and the rate of emotional change in the conversation, comparing 46 subjects with suicidal behavior to those without. While the suicidal group exhibited more frequent emotional changes than the non-suicidal group, the difference was not statistically significant.Importantly, our findings suggest that emotional fluctuation intensity and frequency could serve as novel features for psychological assessment scales and suicide risk prediction.The proposed method provides valuable insights into emotional dynamics and has the potential to advance early intervention and improve suicide prevention strategies through integration with clinical tools and assessments The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/Sco-field/Speechemotionrecognition/tree/main.</description>

      <title>The Inherent Limits of Pretrained LLMs: The Unexpected Convergence of Instruction Tuning and In-Context Learning Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive web-scale corpora, have demonstrated remarkable abilities across diverse tasks, especially as they are scaled up. Nevertheless, even state-of-the-art models struggle in certain cases, sometimes failing at problems solvable by young children, indicating that traditional notions of task complexity are insufficient for explaining LLM capabilities. However, exploring LLM capabilities is complicated by the fact that most widely-used models are also "instruction-tuned" to respond appropriately to prompts. With the goal of disentangling the factors influencing LLM performance, we investigate whether instruction-tuned models possess fundamentally different capabilities from base models that are prompted using in-context examples. Through extensive experiments across various model families, scales and task types, which included instruction tuning 90 different LLMs, we demonstrate that the performance of instruction-tuned models is significantly correlated with the in-context performance of their base counterparts. By clarifying what instruction-tuning contributes, we extend prior research into in-context learning, which suggests that base models use priors from pretraining data to solve tasks. Specifically, we extend this understanding to instruction-tuned models, suggesting that their pretraining data similarly sets a limiting boundary on the tasks they can solve, with the added influence of the instruction-tuning dataset.</description>

      <title>Expanding Vietnamese SentiWordNet to Improve Performance of Vietnamese Sentiment Analysis Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sentiment analysis is one of the most crucial tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP), involving the training of machine learning models to classify text based on the polarity of opinions. Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) can be applied to downstream tasks through fine-tuning, eliminating the need to train the model from scratch. Specifically, PLMs have been employed for Sentiment Analysis, a process that involves detecting, analyzing, and extracting the polarity of text sentiments. Numerous models have been proposed to address this task, with pre-trained PhoBERT-V2 models standing out as the state-of-the-art language models for Vietnamese. The PhoBERT-V2 pre-training approach is based on RoBERTa, optimizing the BERT pre-training method for more robust performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that combines PhoBERT-V2 and SentiWordnet for Sentiment Analysis of Vietnamese reviews. Our proposed model utilizes PhoBERT-V2 for Vietnamese, offering a robust optimization for the prominent BERT model in the context of Vietnamese language, and leverages SentiWordNet, a lexical resource explicitly designed to support sentiment classification applications. Experimental results on the VLSP 2016 and AIVIVN 2019 datasets demonstrate that our sentiment analysis system has achieved excellent performance in comparison to other models.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Large Language Models for Effective Screening of Depression and Anxiety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depressive and anxiety disorders are widespread, necessitating timely identification and management. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential solutions, yet high costs and ethical concerns about training data remain challenges. This paper introduces a pipeline for synthesizing clinical interviews, resulting in 1,157 interactive dialogues (PsyInterview), and presents EmoScan, an LLM-based emotional disorder screening system. EmoScan distinguishes between coarse (e.g., anxiety or depressive disorders) and fine disorders (e.g., major depressive disorders) and conducts high-quality interviews. Evaluations showed that EmoScan exceeded the performance of base models and other LLMs like GPT-4 in screening emotional disorders (F1-score=0.7467). It also delivers superior explanations (BERTScore=0.9408) and demonstrates robust generalizability (F1-score of 0.67 on an external dataset). Furthermore, EmoScan outperforms baselines in interviewing skills, as validated by automated ratings and human evaluations. This work highlights the importance of scalable data-generative pipelines for developing effective mental health LLM tools.</description>

      <title>ToMATO: Verbalizing the Mental States of Role-Playing LLMs for Benchmarking Theory of Mind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks diverge from real-world scenarios in three aspects: 1) they assess a limited range of mental states such as beliefs, 2) false beliefs are not comprehensively explored, and 3) the diverse personality traits of characters are overlooked. To address these challenges, we introduce ToMATO, a new ToM benchmark formulated as multiple-choice QA over conversations. ToMATO is generated via LLM-LLM conversations featuring information asymmetry. By employing a prompting method that requires role-playing LLMs to verbalize their thoughts before each utterance, we capture both first- and second-order mental states across five categories: belief, intention, desire, emotion, and knowledge. These verbalized thoughts serve as answers to questions designed to assess the mental states of characters within conversations. Furthermore, the information asymmetry introduced by hiding thoughts from others induces the generation of false beliefs about various mental states. Assigning distinct personality traits to LLMs further diversifies both utterances and thoughts. ToMATO consists of 5.4k questions, 753 conversations, and 15 personality trait patterns. Our analysis shows that this dataset construction approach frequently generates false beliefs due to the information asymmetry between role-playing LLMs, and effectively reflects diverse personalities. We evaluate nine LLMs on ToMATO and find that even GPT-4o mini lags behind human performance, especially in understanding false beliefs, and lacks robustness to various personality traits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently there have been many shared tasks targeting the detection of generated text from Large Language Models (LLMs). However, these shared tasks tend to focus either on cases where text is limited to one particular domain or cases where text can be from many domains, some of which may not be seen during test time. In this shared task, using the newly released RAID benchmark, we aim to answer whether or not models can detect generated text from a large, yet fixed, number of domains and LLMs, all of which are seen during training. Over the course of three months, our task was attempted by 9 teams with 23 detector submissions. We find that multiple participants were able to obtain accuracies of over 99% on machine-generated text from RAID while maintaining a 5% False Positive Rate -- suggesting that detectors are able to robustly detect text from many domains and models simultaneously. We discuss potential interpretations of this result and provide directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Applying General Turn-taking Models to Conversational Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turn-taking is a fundamental aspect of conversation, but current Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) systems often rely on simplistic, silence-based models, leading to unnatural pauses and interruptions. This paper investigates, for the first time, the application of general turn-taking models, specifically TurnGPT and Voice Activity Projection (VAP), to improve conversational dynamics in HRI. These models are trained on human-human dialogue data using self-supervised learning objectives, without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose methods for using these models in tandem to predict when a robot should begin preparing responses, take turns, and handle potential interruptions. We evaluated the proposed system in a within-subject study against a traditional baseline system, using the Furhat robot with 39 adults in a conversational setting, in combination with a large language model for autonomous response generation. The results show that participants significantly prefer the proposed system, and it significantly reduces response delays and interruptions.</description>

      <title>Learning to Extract Cross-Domain Aspects and Understanding Sentiments Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ASBA) is a refined approach to sentiment analysis that aims to extract and classify sentiments based on specific aspects or features of a product, service, or entity. Unlike traditional sentiment analysis, which assigns a general sentiment score to entire reviews or texts, ABSA focuses on breaking down the text into individual components or aspects (e.g., quality, price, service) and evaluating the sentiment towards each. This allows for a more granular level of understanding of customer opinions, enabling businesses to pinpoint specific areas of strength and improvement. The process involves several key steps, including aspect extraction, sentiment classification, and aspect-level sentiment aggregation for a review paragraph or any other form that the users have provided. ABSA has significant applications in areas such as product reviews, social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and market research. By leveraging techniques from natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, ABSA facilitates the extraction of valuable insights, enabling companies to make data-driven decisions that enhance customer satisfaction and optimize offerings. As ABSA evolves, it holds the potential to greatly improve personalized customer experiences by providing a deeper understanding of sentiment across various product aspects. In this work, we have analyzed the strength of LLMs for a complete cross-domain aspect-based sentiment analysis with the aim of defining the framework for certain products and using it for other similar situations. We argue that it is possible to that at an effectiveness of 92\% accuracy for the Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis dataset of SemEval-2015 Task 12.</description>

      <title>Personality Modeling for Persuasion of Misinformation using AI Agent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation on social media platforms has highlighted the need to understand how individual personality traits influence susceptibility to and propagation of misinformation. This study employs an innovative agent-based modeling approach to investigate the relationship between personality traits and misinformation dynamics. Using six AI agents embodying different dimensions of the Big Five personality traits (Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism), we simulated interactions across six diverse misinformation topics. The experiment, implemented through the AgentScope framework using the GLM-4-Flash model, generated 90 unique interactions, revealing complex patterns in how personality combinations affect persuasion and resistance to misinformation. Our findings demonstrate that analytical and critical personality traits enhance effectiveness in evidence-based discussions, while non-aggressive persuasion strategies show unexpected success in misinformation correction. Notably, agents with critical traits achieved a 59.4% success rate in HIV-related misinformation discussions, while those employing non-aggressive approaches maintained consistent persuasion rates above 40% across different personality combinations. The study also revealed a non-transitive pattern in persuasion effectiveness, challenging conventional assumptions about personality-based influence. These results provide crucial insights for developing personality-aware interventions in digital environments and suggest that effective misinformation countermeasures should prioritize emotional connection and trust-building over confrontational approaches. The findings contribute to both theoretical understanding of personality-misinformation dynamics and practical strategies for combating misinformation in social media contexts.</description>

      <title>Aegis2.0: A Diverse AI Safety Dataset and Risks Taxonomy for Alignment of LLM Guardrails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI become increasingly widespread, concerns about content safety have grown in parallel. Currently, there is a clear lack of high-quality, human-annotated datasets that address the full spectrum of LLM-related safety risks and are usable for commercial applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive and adaptable taxonomy for categorizing safety risks, structured into 12 top-level hazard categories with an extension to 9 fine-grained subcategories. This taxonomy is designed to meet the diverse requirements of downstream users, offering more granular and flexible tools for managing various risk types. Using a hybrid data generation pipeline that combines human annotations with a multi-LLM "jury" system to assess the safety of responses, we obtain Aegis 2.0, a carefully curated collection of 34,248 samples of human-LLM interactions, annotated according to our proposed taxonomy. To validate its effectiveness, we demonstrate that several lightweight models, trained using parameter-efficient techniques on Aegis 2.0, achieve performance competitive with leading safety models fully fine-tuned on much larger, non-commercial datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training blend that combines safety with topic following data.This approach enhances the adaptability of guard models, enabling them to generalize to new risk categories defined during inference. We plan to open-source Aegis 2.0 data and models to the research community to aid in the safety guardrailing of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Towards Best Practices for Open Datasets for LLM Training</title>

Abstract: Many AI companies are training their large language models (LLMs) on data without the permission of the copyright owners. The permissibility of doing so varies by jurisdiction: in countries like the EU and Japan, this is allowed under certain restrictions, while in the United States, the legal landscape is more ambiguous. Regardless of the legal status, concerns from creative producers have led to several high-profile copyright lawsuits, and the threat of litigation is commonly cited as a reason for the recent trend towards minimizing the information shared about training datasets by both corporate and public interest actors. This trend in limiting data information causes harm by hindering transparency, accountability, and innovation in the broader ecosystem by denying researchers, auditors, and impacted individuals access to the information needed to understand AI models.
  While this could be mitigated by training language models on open access and public domain data, at the time of writing, there are no such models (trained at a meaningful scale) due to the substantial technical and sociological challenges in assembling the necessary corpus. These challenges include incomplete and unreliable metadata, the cost and complexity of digitizing physical records, and the diverse set of legal and technical skills required to ensure relevance and responsibility in a quickly changing landscape. Building towards a future where AI systems can be trained on openly licensed data that is responsibly curated and governed requires collaboration across legal, technical, and policy domains, along with investments in metadata standards, digitization, and fostering a culture of openness.</description>

      <title>OptiChat: Bridging Optimization Models and Practitioners with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization models have been applied to solve a wide variety of decision-making problems. These models are usually developed by optimization experts but are used by practitioners without optimization expertise in various application domains. As a result, practitioners often struggle to interact with and draw useful conclusions from optimization models independently. To fill this gap, we introduce OptiChat, a natural language dialogue system designed to help practitioners interpret model formulation, diagnose infeasibility, analyze sensitivity, retrieve information, evaluate modifications, and provide counterfactual explanations. By augmenting large language models (LLMs) with functional calls and code generation tailored for optimization models, we enable seamless interaction and minimize the risk of hallucinations in OptiChat. We develop a new dataset to evaluate OptiChat's performance in explaining optimization models. Experiments demonstrate that OptiChat effectively bridges the gap between optimization models and practitioners, delivering autonomous, accurate, and instant responses.</description>

      <title>SEAL: Speaker Error Correction using Acoustic-conditioned Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speaker Diarization (SD) is a crucial component of modern end-to-end ASR pipelines. Traditional SD systems, which are typically audio-based and operate independently of ASR, often introduce speaker errors, particularly during speaker transitions and overlapping speech. Recently, language models including fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) have shown to be effective as a second-pass speaker error corrector by leveraging lexical context in the transcribed output. In this work, we introduce a novel acoustic conditioning approach to provide more fine-grained information from the acoustic diarizer to the LLM. We also show that a simpler constrained decoding strategy reduces LLM hallucinations, while avoiding complicated post-processing. Our approach significantly reduces the speaker error rates by 24-43% across Fisher, Callhome, and RT03-CTS datasets, compared to the first-pass Acoustic SD.</description>

      <title>Tag&amp;Tab: Pretraining Data Detection in Large Language Models Using Keyword-Based Membership Inference Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential digital task assistance tools. Their training relies heavily on the collection of vast amounts of data, which may include copyright-protected or sensitive information. Recent studies on the detection of pretraining data in LLMs have primarily focused on sentence-level or paragraph-level membership inference attacks (MIAs), usually involving probability analysis of the target model prediction tokens. However, the proposed methods often demonstrate poor performance, specifically in terms of accuracy, failing to account for the semantic importance of textual content and word significance. To address these shortcomings, we propose Tag&amp;Tab, a novel approach for detecting data that has been used as part of the LLM pretraining. Our method leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to tag keywords in the input text - a process we term Tagging. Then, the LLM is used to obtain the probabilities of these keywords and calculate their average log-likelihood to determine input text membership, a process we refer to as Tabbing. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets (BookMIA, MIMIR, and the Pile) and several open-source LLMs of varying sizes demonstrate an average increase in the AUC scores ranging from 4.1% to 12.1% over state-of-the-art methods. Tag&amp;Tab not only sets a new standard for data leakage detection in LLMs, but its outstanding performance is a testament to the importance of words in MIAs on LLMs.</description>

Abstract: In the current era of Machine Learning, Transformers have become the de facto approach across a variety of domains, such as computer vision and natural language processing. Transformer-based solutions are the backbone of current state-of-the-art methods for language generation, image and video classification, segmentation, action and object recognition, among many others. Interestingly enough, while these state-of-the-art methods produce impressive results in their respective domains, the problem of understanding the relationship between vision and language is still beyond our reach. In this work, we propose a common ground between vision and language based on events in space and time in an explainable and programmatic way, to connect learning-based vision and language state of the art models and provide a solution to the long standing problem of describing videos in natural language. We validate that our algorithmic approach is able to generate coherent, rich and relevant textual descriptions on videos collected from a variety of datasets, using both standard metrics (e.g. Bleu, ROUGE) and the modern LLM-as-a-Jury approach.</description>

      <title>RLHS: Mitigating Misalignment in RLHF with Hindsight Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI systems like foundation models (FMs) must align well with human values to ensure their behavior is helpful and trustworthy. While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown promise for optimizing model performance using human judgments, existing RLHF pipelines predominantly rely on immediate feedback, which can fail to accurately reflect the downstream impact of an interaction on users' utility. We demonstrate that feedback based on evaluators' foresight estimates of downstream consequences systematically induces Goodhart's Law dynamics, incentivizing misaligned behaviors like sycophancy and deception and ultimately degrading user outcomes. To alleviate this, we propose decoupling evaluation from prediction by refocusing RLHF on hindsight feedback. Our theoretical analysis reveals that conditioning evaluator feedback on downstream observations mitigates misalignment and improves expected human utility, even when these observations are simulated by the AI system itself. To leverage this insight in a practical alignment algorithm, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Hindsight Simulation (RLHS), which first simulates plausible consequences and then elicits feedback to assess what behaviors were genuinely beneficial in hindsight. We apply RLHS to two widely-employed online and offline preference optimization methods -- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) -- and show empirically that misalignment is significantly reduced with both methods. Through an online human user study, we show that RLHS consistently outperforms RLHF in helping users achieve their goals and earns higher satisfaction ratings, despite being trained solely with simulated hindsight feedback. These results underscore the importance of focusing on long-term consequences, even simulated ones, to mitigate misalignment in RLHF.</description>

      <title>SWSC: Shared Weight for Similar Channel in LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have spurred development in multiple industries. However, the growing number of their parameters brings substantial storage and computing burdens, making it essential to explore model compression techniques for parameter reduction and easier deployment. We propose SWSC, an LLM compression method based on the concept of Shared Weight for Similar Channel. It uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to cluster model weights channel-by-channel, generating clusters with highly similar vectors within each. A representative vector from each cluster is selected to approximately replace all vectors in the cluster, significantly reducing the number of model weight parameters. However, approximate restoration will inevitably cause damage to the performance of the model. To tackle this issue, we perform singular value decomposition on the weight error values before and after compression and retain the larger singular values and their corresponding singular vectors to compensate for the accuracy. The experimental results show that our method can effectively ensure the performance of the compressed LLM even under low-precision conditions.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Schema Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional similarity-based schema matching methods are incapable of resolving semantic ambiguities and conflicts in domain-specific complex mapping scenarios due to missing commonsense and domain-specific knowledge. The hallucination problem of large language models (LLMs) also makes it challenging for LLM-based schema matching to address the above issues. Therefore, we propose a Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation model for Schema Matching, referred to as the KG-RAG4SM. In particular, KG-RAG4SM introduces novel vector-based, graph traversal-based, and query-based graph retrievals, as well as a hybrid approach and ranking schemes that identify the most relevant subgraphs from external large knowledge graphs (KGs). We showcase that KG-based retrieval-augmented LLMs are capable of generating more accurate results for complex matching cases without any re-training. Our experimental results show that KG-RAG4SM outperforms the LLM-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods (e.g., Jellyfish-8B) by 35.89% and 30.50% in terms of precision and F1 score on the MIMIC dataset, respectively; KG-RAG4SM with GPT-4o-mini outperforms the pre-trained language model (PLM)-based SOTA methods (e.g., SMAT) by 69.20% and 21.97% in terms of precision and F1 score on the Synthea dataset, respectively. The results also demonstrate that our approach is more efficient in end-to-end schema matching, and scales to retrieve from large KGs. Our case studies on the dataset from the real-world schema matching scenario exhibit that the hallucination problem of LLMs for schema matching is well mitigated by our solution.</description>

      <title>SAIF: A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating the Risks of Generative AI in the Public Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative AI in the public sector, encompassing diverse applications ranging from automated public assistance to welfare services and immigration processes, highlights its transformative potential while underscoring the pressing need for thorough risk assessments. Despite its growing presence, evaluations of risks associated with AI-driven systems in the public sector remain insufficiently explored. Building upon an established taxonomy of AI risks derived from diverse government policies and corporate guidelines, we investigate the critical risks posed by generative AI in the public sector while extending the scope to account for its multimodal capabilities. In addition, we propose a Systematic dAta generatIon Framework for evaluating the risks of generative AI (SAIF). SAIF involves four key stages: breaking down risks, designing scenarios, applying jailbreak methods, and exploring prompt types. It ensures the systematic and consistent generation of prompt data, facilitating a comprehensive evaluation while providing a solid foundation for mitigating the risks. Furthermore, SAIF is designed to accommodate emerging jailbreak methods and evolving prompt types, thereby enabling effective responses to unforeseen risk scenarios. We believe that this study can play a crucial role in fostering the safe and responsible integration of generative AI into the public sector.</description>

      <title>MMDocIR: Benchmarking Multi-Modal Retrieval for Long Documents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal document retrieval is designed to identify and retrieve various forms of multi-modal content, such as figures, tables, charts, and layout information from extensive documents. Despite its significance, there is a notable lack of a robust benchmark to effectively evaluate the performance of systems in multi-modal document retrieval. To address this gap, this work introduces a new benchmark, named as MMDocIR, encompassing two distinct tasks: page-level and layout-level retrieval. The former focuses on localizing the most relevant pages within a long document, while the latter targets the detection of specific layouts, offering a more fine-grained granularity than whole-page analysis. A layout can refer to a variety of elements such as textual paragraphs, equations, figures, tables, or charts. The MMDocIR benchmark comprises a rich dataset featuring expertly annotated labels for 1,685 questions and bootstrapped labels for 173,843 questions, making it a pivotal resource for advancing multi-modal document retrieval for both training and evaluation. Through rigorous experiments, we reveal that (i) visual retrievers significantly outperform their text counterparts, (ii) MMDocIR train set can effectively benefit the training process of multi-modal document retrieval and (iii) text retrievers leveraging on VLM-text perform much better than those using OCR-text. These findings underscores the potential advantages of integrating visual elements for multi-modal document retrieval.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Exploration of Large Language Models by Optimal Exploitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploration is a crucial skill for self-improvement and open-ended problem-solving. However, it remains uncertain whether large language models can effectively explore the state-space. Existing evaluations predominantly focus on the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, often assessed in multi-armed bandit problems. In contrast, this work isolates exploration as the sole objective, tasking the agent with delivering information that enhances future returns. For the evaluation, we propose to decompose missing rewards into exploration and exploitation components by measuring the optimal achievable return for the states already explored. Our experiments with various LLMs reveal that most models struggle to sufficiently explore the state-space and that weak exploration is insufficient. We observe a positive correlation between model size and exploration performance, with larger models demonstrating superior capabilities. Furthermore, we show that our decomposition provides insights into differences in behaviors driven by agent instructions during prompt engineering, offering a valuable tool for refining LLM performance in exploratory tasks.</description>

      <title>Multimodal LLMs Can Reason about Aesthetics in Zero-Shot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first study on how Multimodal LLMs' (MLLMs) reasoning ability shall be elicited to evaluate the aesthetics of artworks. To facilitate this investigation, we construct MM-StyleBench, a novel high-quality dataset for benchmarking artistic stylization. We then develop a principled method for human preference modeling and perform a systematic correlation analysis between MLLMs' responses and human preference. Our experiments reveal an inherent hallucination issue of MLLMs in art evaluation, associated with response subjectivity. ArtCoT is proposed, demonstrating that art-specific task decomposition and the use of concrete language boost MLLMs' reasoning ability for aesthetics. Our findings offer valuable insights into MLLMs for art and can benefit a wide range of downstream applications, such as style transfer and artistic image generation.

      <title>How to Build an AI Tutor That Can Adapt to Any Course Using Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17696v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for adaptable AI tutors using Knowledge Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG). This approach addresses the critical challenges of information hallucination and limited course-specific adaptation prevalent in Large Language Model (LLM)-based tutoring systems. By integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with RAG, we provide a structured representation of course concepts and their interrelationships, grounding the AI tutor's responses in relevant, validated material. We leverage Qwen2.5, a powerful and cost-effective LLM, within our KG-RAG framework. A user study (n=50) demonstrated positive student feedback regarding answer relevance, ease of use, and overall satisfaction. This KG-RAG framework offers a promising pathway towards personalized learning experiences and broader access to high-quality education.</description>

      <title>SelectIT: Selective Instruction Tuning for LLMs via Uncertainty-Aware Self-Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instruction tuning (IT) is crucial to tailoring large language models (LLMs) towards human-centric interactions. Recent advancements have shown that the careful selection of a small, high-quality subset of IT data can significantly enhance the performance of LLMs. Despite this, common approaches often rely on additional models or data, which increases costs and limits widespread adoption. In this work, we propose a novel approach, termed SelectIT, that capitalizes on the foundational capabilities of the LLM itself. Specifically, we exploit the intrinsic uncertainty present in LLMs to more effectively select high-quality IT data, without the need for extra resources. Furthermore, we introduce a curated IT dataset, the Selective Alpaca, created by applying SelectIT to the Alpaca-GPT4 dataset. Empirical results demonstrate that IT using Selective Alpaca leads to substantial model ability enhancement. The robustness of SelectIT has also been corroborated in various foundation models and domain-specific tasks. Our findings suggest that longer and more computationally intensive IT data may serve as superior sources of IT, offering valuable insights for future research in this area.

      <title>Noise-powered Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Representation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06832v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of Multi-modal Pre-training highlights the necessity for a unified Multi-Modal Knowledge Graph (MMKG) representation learning framework. Such a framework is essential for embedding structured knowledge into multi-modal Large Language Models effectively, alleviating issues like knowledge misconceptions and multi-modal hallucinations. In this work, we explore the efficacy of models in accurately embedding entities within MMKGs through two pivotal tasks: Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion (MKGC) and Multi-modal Entity Alignment (MMEA). Building on this foundation, we propose a novel SNAG method that utilizes a Transformer-based architecture equipped with modality-level noise masking to robustly integrate multi-modal entity features in KGs. By incorporating specific training objectives for both MKGC and MMEA, our approach achieves SOTA performance across a total of ten datasets, demonstrating its versatility. Moreover, SNAG can not only function as a standalone model but also enhance other existing methods, providing stable performance improvements.

      <title>Understanding Emergent Abilities of Language Models from the Loss Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have put into question the belief that emergent abilities in language models are exclusive to large models. This skepticism arises from two observations: 1) smaller models can also exhibit high performance on emergent abilities and 2) there is doubt on the discontinuous metrics used to measure these abilities. In this paper, we propose to study emergent abilities in the lens of pre-training loss, instead of model size or training compute. We demonstrate that the Transformer models with the same pre-training loss, but different model and data sizes, generate the same performance on various downstream tasks, with a fixed data corpus, tokenization, and model architecture. We also discover that a model exhibits emergent abilities on certain tasks -- regardless of the continuity of metrics -- when its pre-training loss falls below a specific threshold. Before reaching this threshold, its performance remains at the level of random guessing. This inspires us to redefine emergent abilities as those that manifest in models with lower pre-training losses, highlighting that these abilities cannot be predicted by merely extrapolating the performance trends of models with higher pre-training losses.</description>

      <title>TANQ: An open domain dataset of table answered questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language models, potentially augmented with tool usage such as retrieval are becoming the go-to means of answering questions. Understanding and answering questions in real-world settings often requires retrieving information from different sources, processing and aggregating data to extract insights, and presenting complex findings in form of structured artifacts such as novel tables, charts, or infographics. In this paper, we introduce TANQ, the first open domain question answering dataset where the answers require building tables from information across multiple sources. We release the full source attribution for every cell in the resulting table and benchmark state-of-the-art language models in open, oracle, and closed book setups. Our best-performing baseline, GPT4 reaches an overall F1 score of 29.1, lagging behind human performance by 19.7 points. We analyse baselines' performance across different dataset attributes such as different skills required for this task, including multi-hop reasoning, math operations, and unit conversions. We further discuss common failures in model-generated answers, suggesting that TANQ is a complex task with many challenges ahead.</description>

      <title>Beyond Boundaries: Learning a Universal Entity Taxonomy across Datasets and Languages for Open Named Entity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open Named Entity Recognition (NER), which involves identifying arbitrary types of entities from arbitrary domains, remains challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that fine-tuning LLMs on extensive NER data can boost their performance. However, training directly on existing datasets neglects their inconsistent entity definitions and redundant data, limiting LLMs to dataset-specific learning and hindering out-of-domain adaptation. To address this, we present B2NERD, a compact dataset designed to guide LLMs' generalization in Open NER under a universal entity taxonomy. B2NERD is refined from 54 existing English and Chinese datasets using a two-step process. First, we detect inconsistent entity definitions across datasets and clarify them by distinguishable label names to construct a universal taxonomy of 400+ entity types. Second, we address redundancy using a data pruning strategy that selects fewer samples with greater category and semantic diversity. Comprehensive evaluation shows that B2NERD significantly enhances LLMs' Open NER capabilities. Our B2NER models, trained on B2NERD, outperform GPT-4 by 6.8-12.0 F1 points and surpass previous methods in 3 out-of-domain benchmarks across 15 datasets and 6 languages. The data, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/UmeanNever/B2NER.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Debating with Preset Stances for Hallucination Elimination of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various natural language processing tasks but struggle with hallucination issues. Existing solutions have considered utilizing LLMs' inherent reasoning abilities to alleviate hallucination, such as self-correction and diverse sampling methods. However, these methods often overtrust LLMs' initial answers due to inherent biases. The key to alleviating this issue lies in overriding LLMs' inherent biases for answer inspection. To this end, we propose a CounterFactual Multi-Agent Debate (CFMAD) framework. CFMAD presets the stances of LLMs to override their inherent biases by compelling LLMs to generate justifications for a predetermined answer's correctness. The LLMs with different predetermined stances are engaged with a skeptical critic for counterfactual debate on the rationality of generated justifications. Finally, the debate process is evaluated by a third-party judge to determine the final answer. Extensive experiments on four datasets of three tasks demonstrate the superiority of CFMAD over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Empowering Persian LLMs for Instruction Following: A Novel Dataset and Training Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11186v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instruction-tuned large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in following human instructions across various domains. However, their proficiency remains notably deficient in many low-resource languages. To address this challenge, we begin by introducing FarsInstruct a comprehensive instruction dataset designed to enhance the instruction following ability of large language models specifically for the Persian language a significant yet underrepresented language globally. FarsInstruct encompasses a wide range of task types and datasets, each containing a mix of straightforward to complex manual written instructions, as well as translations from the Public Pool of Prompts, ensuring a rich linguistic and cultural representation. Furthermore, we introduce Co-CoLA, a framework designed to enhance the multi-task adaptability of LoRA-tuned models. Through extensive experimental analyses, our study showcases the effectiveness of the FarsInstruct dataset coupled with training by the Co-CoLA framework, in improving the performance of large language models within the Persian context. As of the current writing, FarsInstruct comprises 197 templates across 21 distinct datasets, and we intend to update it consistently, thus augmenting its applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20906v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Literature research, vital for scientific work, faces the challenge of surging information volumes exceeding researchers' processing capabilities. We present an automated review generation method based on large language models (LLMs) to overcome efficiency bottlenecks and reduce cognitive load. Our statistically validated evaluation framework demonstrates that the generated reviews match or exceed manual quality, offering broad applicability across research fields without requiring users' domain knowledge. Applied to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts, our method swiftly analyzed 343 articles, averaging seconds per article per LLM account, producing comprehensive reviews spanning 35 topics, with extended analysis of 1041 articles providing insights into catalysts' properties. Through multi-layered quality control, we effectively mitigated LLMs' hallucinations, with expert verification confirming accuracy and citation integrity while demonstrating hallucination risks reduced to below 0.5\% with 95\% confidence. Released Windows application enables one-click review generation, enhancing research productivity and literature recommendation efficiency while setting the stage for broader scientific explorations.</description>

      <title>Con-ReCall: Detecting Pre-training Data in LLMs via Contrastive Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The training data in large language models is key to their success, but it also presents privacy and security risks, as it may contain sensitive information. Detecting pre-training data is crucial for mitigating these concerns. Existing methods typically analyze target text in isolation or solely with non-member contexts, overlooking potential insights from simultaneously considering both member and non-member contexts. While previous work suggested that member contexts provide little information due to the minor distributional shift they induce, our analysis reveals that these subtle shifts can be effectively leveraged when contrasted with non-member contexts. In this paper, we propose Con-ReCall, a novel approach that leverages the asymmetric distributional shifts induced by member and non-member contexts through contrastive decoding, amplifying subtle differences to enhance membership inference. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Con-ReCall achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WikiMIA benchmark and is robust against various text manipulation techniques.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Knowledge Conflicts in Language Model-Driven Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of knowledge-driven seq-to-seq generation tasks, such as document-based question answering and document summarization systems, two fundamental knowledge sources play crucial roles: the inherent knowledge embedded within model parameters and the external knowledge obtained through context. Recent studies revealed a significant challenge: when there exists a misalignment between the model's inherent knowledge and the ground truth answers in training data, the system may exhibit problematic behaviors during inference, such as ignoring input context, or generating unfaithful content. Our investigation proposes a strategy to minimize hallucination by building explicit connection between source inputs and generated outputs. We specifically target a common hallucination pattern in question answering, examining how the correspondence between entities and their contexts during model training influences the system's performance at inference time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (SA-ASR) aims to transcribe speech while assigning transcripts to the corresponding speakers accurately. Existing methods often rely on complex modular systems or require extensive fine-tuning of joint modules, limiting their adaptability and general efficiency. This paper introduces a novel approach, leveraging a frozen multilingual ASR model to incorporate speaker attribution into the transcriptions, using only standard monolingual ASR datasets. Our method involves training a speaker module to predict speaker embeddings based on weak labels without requiring additional ASR model modifications. Despite being trained exclusively with non-overlapping monolingual data, our approach effectively extracts speaker attributes across diverse multilingual datasets, including those with overlapping speech. Experimental results demonstrate competitive performance compared to strong baselines, highlighting the model's robustness and potential for practical applications.</description>

      <title>U-MATH: A University-Level Benchmark for Evaluating Mathematical Skills in LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current evaluation of mathematical skills in LLMs is limited, as existing benchmarks are either relatively small, primarily focus on elementary and high-school problems, or lack diversity in topics. Additionally, the inclusion of visual elements in tasks remains largely under-explored.
  To address these gaps, we introduce U-MATH, a novel benchmark of 1,100 unpublished open-ended university-level problems sourced from teaching materials. It is balanced across six core subjects, with 20% of multimodal problems. Given the open-ended nature of U-MATH problems, we employ an LLM to judge the correctness of generated solutions. To this end, we release $\mu$-MATH, a dataset to evaluate the LLMs' capabilities in judging solutions.
  The evaluation of general domain, math-specific, and multimodal LLMs highlights the challenges presented by U-MATH. Our findings reveal that LLMs achieve a maximum accuracy of only 63% on text-based tasks, with even lower 45% on visual problems. The solution assessment proves challenging for LLMs, with the best LLM judge having an F1-score of 80% on $\mu$-MATH.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant effectiveness across various NLP tasks, including text ranking. This study assesses the performance of large language models (LLMs) in listwise reranking for limited-resource African languages. We compare proprietary models RankGPT3.5, Rank4o-mini, RankGPTo1-mini and RankClaude-sonnet in cross-lingual contexts. Results indicate that these LLMs significantly outperform traditional baseline methods such as BM25-DT in most evaluation metrics, particularly in nDCG@10 and MRR@100. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in enhancing reranking tasks for low-resource languages and offer insights into cost-effective solutions.</description>

Abstract: We present OLMo 2, the next generation of our fully open language models. OLMo 2 includes dense autoregressive models with improved architecture and training recipe, pretraining data mixtures, and instruction tuning recipes. Our modified model architecture and training recipe achieve both better training stability and improved per-token efficiency. Our updated pretraining data mixture introduces a new, specialized data mix called Dolmino Mix 1124, which significantly improves model capabilities across many downstream task benchmarks when introduced via late-stage curriculum training (i.e. specialized data during the annealing phase of pretraining). Finally, we incorporate best practices from T\"ulu 3 to develop OLMo 2-Instruct, focusing on permissive data and extending our final-stage reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Our OLMo 2 base models sit at the Pareto frontier of performance to compute, often matching or outperforming open-weight only models like Llama 3.1 and Qwen 2.5 while using fewer FLOPs and with fully transparent training data, code, and recipe. Our fully open OLMo 2-Instruct models are competitive with or surpassing open-weight only models of comparable size, including Qwen 2.5, Llama 3.1 and Gemma 2. We release all OLMo 2 artifacts openly -- models at 7B and 13B scales, both pretrained and post-trained, including their full training data, training code and recipes, training logs and thousands of intermediate checkpoints. The final instruction model is available on the Ai2 Playground as a free research demo.</description>

      <title>KaLM-Embedding: Superior Training Data Brings A Stronger Embedding Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01028v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As retrieval-augmented generation prevails in large language models, embedding models are becoming increasingly crucial. Despite the growing number of general embedding models, prior work often overlooks the critical role of training data quality. In this work, we introduce KaLM-Embedding, a general multilingual embedding model that leverages a large quantity of cleaner, more diverse, and domain-specific training data. Our model has been trained with key techniques proven to enhance performance: (1) persona-based synthetic data to create diversified examples distilled from LLMs, (2) ranking consistency filtering to remove less informative samples, and (3) semi-homogeneous task batch sampling to improve training efficacy. Departing from traditional BERT-like architectures, we adopt Qwen2-0.5B as the pre-trained model, facilitating the adaptation of auto-regressive language models for general embedding tasks. Extensive evaluations of the MTEB benchmark across multiple languages show that our model outperforms others of comparable size, setting a new standard for multilingual embedding models with &lt;1B parameters.</description>

      <title>IndoNLP 2025: Shared Task on Real-Time Reverse Transliteration for Romanized Indo-Aryan languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper overviews the shared task on Real-Time Reverse Transliteration for Romanized Indo-Aryan languages. It focuses on the reverse transliteration of low-resourced languages in the Indo-Aryan family to their native scripts. Typing Romanized Indo-Aryan languages using ad-hoc transliterals and achieving accurate native scripts are complex and often inaccurate processes with the current keyboard systems. This task aims to introduce and evaluate a real-time reverse transliterator that converts Romanized Indo-Aryan languages to their native scripts, improving the typing experience for users. Out of 11 registered teams, four teams participated in the final evaluation phase with transliteration models for Sinhala, Hindi and Malayalam. These proposed solutions not only solve the issue of ad-hoc transliteration but also empower low-resource language usability in the digital arena.</description>

      <title>Consistency of Responses and Continuations Generated by Large Language Models on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in text generation, yet their emotional consistency and semantic coherence in social media contexts remain insufficiently understood. This study investigates how LLMs handle emotional content and maintain semantic relationships through continuation and response tasks using two open-source models: Gemma and Llama. By analyzing climate change discussions from Twitter and Reddit, we examine emotional transitions, intensity patterns, and semantic similarity between human-authored and LLM-generated content. Our findings reveal that while both models maintain high semantic coherence, they exhibit distinct emotional patterns: Gemma shows a tendency toward negative emotion amplification, particularly anger, while maintaining certain positive emotions like optimism. Llama demonstrates superior emotional preservation across a broader spectrum of affects. Both models systematically generate responses with attenuated emotional intensity compared to human-authored content and show a bias toward positive emotions in response tasks. Additionally, both models maintain strong semantic similarity with original texts, though performance varies between continuation and response tasks. These findings provide insights into LLMs' emotional and semantic processing capabilities, with implications for their deployment in social media contexts and human-AI interaction design.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Modal AI Copilot for Single-Cell Analysis with Instruction Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models excel at interpreting complex natural language instructions, enabling them to perform a wide range of tasks. In the life sciences, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data serves as the "language of cellular biology", capturing intricate gene expression patterns at the single-cell level. However, interacting with this "language" through conventional tools is often inefficient and unintuitive, posing challenges for researchers. To address these limitations, we present InstructCell, a multi-modal AI copilot that leverages natural language as a medium for more direct and flexible single-cell analysis. We construct a comprehensive multi-modal instruction dataset that pairs text-based instructions with scRNA-seq profiles from diverse tissues and species. Building on this, we develop a multi-modal cell language architecture capable of simultaneously interpreting and processing both modalities. InstructCell empowers researchers to accomplish critical tasks-such as cell type annotation, conditional pseudo-cell generation, and drug sensitivity prediction-using straightforward natural language commands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that InstructCell consistently meets or exceeds the performance of existing single-cell foundation models, while adapting to diverse experimental conditions. More importantly, InstructCell provides an accessible and intuitive tool for exploring complex single-cell data, lowering technical barriers and enabling deeper biological insights.</description>

      <title>AfriHate: A Multilingual Collection of Hate Speech and Abusive Language Datasets for African Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hate speech and abusive language are global phenomena that need socio-cultural background knowledge to be understood, identified, and moderated. However, in many regions of the Global South, there have been several documented occurrences of (1) absence of moderation and (2) censorship due to the reliance on keyword spotting out of context. Further, high-profile individuals have frequently been at the center of the moderation process, while large and targeted hate speech campaigns against minorities have been overlooked. These limitations are mainly due to the lack of high-quality data in the local languages and the failure to include local communities in the collection, annotation, and moderation processes. To address this issue, we present AfriHate: a multilingual collection of hate speech and abusive language datasets in 15 African languages. Each instance in AfriHate is annotated by native speakers familiar with the local culture. We report the challenges related to the construction of the datasets and present various classification baseline results with and without using LLMs. The datasets, individual annotations, and hate speech and offensive language lexicons are available on https://github.com/AfriHate/AfriHate</description>

      <title>Do Large Language Models Mirror Cognitive Language Processing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in text comprehension and logical reasoning, indicating that the text representations learned by LLMs can facilitate their language processing capabilities. In neuroscience, brain cognitive processing signals are typically utilized to study human language processing. Therefore, it is natural to ask how well the text embeddings from LLMs align with the brain cognitive processing signals, and how training strategies affect the LLM-brain alignment? In this paper, we employ Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to measure the alignment between 23 mainstream LLMs and fMRI signals of the brain to evaluate how effectively LLMs simulate cognitive language processing. We empirically investigate the impact of various factors (e.g., pre-training data size, model scaling, alignment training, and prompts) on such LLM-brain alignment. Experimental results indicate that pre-training data size and model scaling are positively correlated with LLM-brain similarity, and alignment training can significantly improve LLM-brain similarity. Explicit prompts contribute to the consistency of LLMs with brain cognitive language processing, while nonsensical noisy prompts may attenuate such alignment. Additionally, the performance of a wide range of LLM evaluations (e.g., MMLU, Chatbot Arena) is highly correlated with the LLM-brain similarity.</description>

      <title>Mind the Error! Detection and Localization of Instruction Errors in Vision-and-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) is one of the most intuitive yet challenging embodied AI tasks. Agents are tasked to navigate towards a target goal by executing a set of low-level actions, following a series of natural language instructions. All VLN-CE methods in the literature assume that language instructions are exact. However, in practice, instructions given by humans can contain errors when describing a spatial environment due to inaccurate memory or confusion. Current VLN-CE benchmarks do not address this scenario, making the state-of-the-art methods in VLN-CE fragile in the presence of erroneous instructions from human users. For the first time, we propose a novel benchmark dataset that introduces various types of instruction errors considering potential human causes. This benchmark provides valuable insight into the robustness of VLN systems in continuous environments. We observe a noticeable performance drop (up to -25%) in Success Rate when evaluating the state-of-the-art VLN-CE methods on our benchmark. Moreover, we formally define the task of Instruction Error Detection and Localization, and establish an evaluation protocol on top of our benchmark dataset. We also propose an effective method, based on a cross-modal transformer architecture, that achieves the best performance in error detection and localization, compared to baselines. Surprisingly, our proposed method has revealed errors in the validation set of the two commonly used datasets for VLN-CE, i.e., R2R-CE and RxR-CE, demonstrating the utility of our technique in other tasks.

      <title>Natural Language Outlines for Code: Literate Programming in the LLM Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose using natural language outlines as a novel modality and interaction surface for providing AI assistance to developers throughout the software development process. An NL outline for a code function comprises multiple statements written in concise prose, which partition the code and summarize its main ideas in the style of literate programming. Crucially, we find that modern LLMs can generate accurate and high-quality NL outlines in practice. Moreover, NL outlines enable a bidirectional sync between code and NL, allowing changes in one to be automatically reflected in the other. We discuss many use cases for NL outlines: they can accelerate understanding and navigation of code and diffs, simplify code maintenance, augment code search, steer code generation, and more. We then propose and compare multiple LLM prompting techniques for generating outlines and ask professional developers to judge outline quality. Finally, we present two case studies applying NL outlines toward code review and malware detection.</description>

      <title>Toward Automated Simulation Research Workflow through LLM Prompt Engineering Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created new opportunities for the automation of scientific research spanning both experimental processes and computational simulations. This study explores the feasibility of constructing an autonomous simulation agent (ASA) powered by LLMs through prompt engineering and automated program design to automate the entire simulation research process according to a human-provided research plan. This process includes experimental design, remote upload and simulation execution, data analysis, and report compilation. Using a well-studied simulation problem of polymer chain conformations as a test case, we assessed the long-task completion and reliability of ASAs powered by different LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5, etc. Our findings revealed that ASA-GPT-4o achieved near-flawless execution on designated research missions, underscoring the potential of methods like ASA to achieve automation in simulation research processes to enhance research efficiency. The outlined automation can be iteratively performed for up to 20 cycles without human intervention, illustrating the potential of ASA for long-task workflow automation. Additionally, we discussed the intrinsic traits of ASA in managing extensive tasks, focusing on self-validation mechanisms, and the balance between local attention and global oversight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech language models have recently demonstrated great potential as universal speech processing systems. Such models have the ability to model the rich acoustic information existing in audio signals, beyond spoken content, such as emotion, background noise, etc. Despite this, evaluation benchmarks which evaluate awareness to a wide range of acoustic aspects, are lacking. To help bridge this gap, we introduce SALMon, a novel evaluation suite encompassing background noise, emotion, speaker identity and room impulse response. The proposed benchmarks both evaluate the consistency of the inspected element and how much it matches the spoken text. We follow a modelling based approach, measuring whether a model gives correct samples higher scores than incorrect ones. This approach makes the benchmark fast to compute even for large models. We evaluated several speech language models on SALMon, thus highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each evaluated method. We make the code and data publicly available at https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/salmon/ .</description>

      <title>Compositional Automata Embeddings for Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning is a powerful way to control an AI agent's behavior at runtime. That said, popular goal representations, e.g., target states or natural language, are either limited to Markovian tasks or rely on ambiguous task semantics. We propose representing temporal goals using compositions of deterministic finite automata (cDFAs) and use cDFAs to guide RL agents. cDFAs balance the need for formal temporal semantics with ease of interpretation: if one can understand a flow chart, one can understand a cDFA. On the other hand, cDFAs form a countably infinite concept class with Boolean semantics, and subtle changes to the automaton can result in very different tasks, making them difficult to condition agent behavior on. To address this, we observe that all paths through a DFA correspond to a series of reach-avoid tasks and propose pre-training graph neural network embeddings on "reach-avoid derived" DFAs. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed pre-training method enables zero-shot generalization to various cDFA task classes and accelerated policy specialization without the myopic suboptimality of hierarchical methods.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Inference-time Scaling and Steering of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models produce impressive results in modalities ranging from images and video to protein design and text. However, generating samples with user-specified properties remains a challenge. Recent research proposes fine-tuning models to maximize rewards that capture desired properties, but these methods require expensive training and are prone to mode collapse. In this work, we propose Feynman Kac (FK) steering, an inference-time framework for steering diffusion models with reward functions. FK steering works by sampling a system of multiple interacting diffusion processes, called particles, and resampling particles at intermediate steps based on scores computed using functions called potentials. Potentials are defined using rewards for intermediate states and are selected such that a high value indicates that the particle will yield a high-reward sample. We explore various choices of potentials, intermediate rewards, and samplers. We evaluate FK steering on text-to-image and text diffusion models. For steering text-to-image models with a human preference reward, we find that FK steering a 0.8B parameter model outperforms a 2.6B parameter fine-tuned model on prompt fidelity, with faster sampling and no training. For steering text diffusion models with rewards for text quality and specific text attributes, we find that FK steering generates lower perplexity, more linguistically acceptable outputs and enables gradient-free control of attributes like toxicity. Our results demonstrate that inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models, even with off-the-shelf rewards, can provide significant sample quality gains and controllability benefits.
