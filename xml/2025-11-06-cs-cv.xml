      <title>iFlyBot-VLA Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce iFlyBot-VLA, a large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model trained under a novel framework. The main contributions are listed as follows: (1) a latent action model thoroughly trained on large-scale human and robotic manipulation videos; (2) a dual-level action representation framework that jointly supervises both the Vision-Language Model (VLM) and the action expert during training; (3) a mixed training strategy that combines robot trajectory data with general QA and spatial QA datasets, effectively enhancing the 3D perceptual and reasoning capabilities of the VLM backbone. Specifically, the VLM is trained to predict two complementary forms of actions: latent actions, derived from our latent action model pretrained on cross-embodiment manipulation data, which capture implicit high-level intentions; and structured discrete action tokens, obtained through frequency-domain transformations of continuous control signals, which encode explicit low-level dynamics. This dual supervision aligns the representation spaces of language, vision, and action, enabling the VLM to directly contribute to action generation. Experimental results on the LIBERO Franka benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our frame-work, while real-world evaluations further show that iFlyBot-VLA achieves competitive success rates across diverse and challenging manipulation tasks. Furthermore, we plan to open-source a portion of our self-constructed dataset to support future research in the community</description>

      <title>Challenging DINOv3 Foundation Model under Low Inter-Class Variability: A Case Study on Fetal Brain Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of foundation models in fetal ultrasound (US) imaging under low inter-class variability conditions. While recent vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have shown remarkable transferability across medical domains, their ability to discriminate anatomically similar structures has not been systematically investigated. We address this gap by focusing on fetal brain standard planes--transthalamic (TT), transventricular (TV), and transcerebellar (TC)--which exhibit highly overlapping anatomical features and pose a critical challenge for reliable biometric assessment.
  Methods: To ensure a fair and reproducible evaluation, all publicly available fetal ultrasound datasets were curated and aggregated into a unified multicenter benchmark, FetalUS-188K, comprising more than 188,000 annotated images from heterogeneous acquisition settings. DINOv3 was pretrained in a self-supervised manner to learn ultrasound-aware representations. The learned features were then evaluated through standardized adaptation protocols, including linear probing with frozen backbone and full fine-tuning, under two initialization schemes: (i) pretraining on FetalUS-188K and (ii) initialization from natural-image DINOv3 weights.
  Results: Models pretrained on fetal ultrasound data consistently outperformed those initialized on natural images, with weighted F1-score improvements of up to 20 percent. Domain-adaptive pretraining enabled the network to preserve subtle echogenic and structural cues crucial for distinguishing intermediate planes such as TV.
  Conclusion: Results demonstrate that generic foundation models fail to generalize under low inter-class variability, whereas domain-specific pretraining is essential to achieve robust and clinically reliable representations in fetal brain ultrasound imaging.</description>

      <title>Assessing the value of Geo-Foundational Models for Flood Inundation Mapping: Benchmarking models for Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Planetscope for end-users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) enable fast and reliable extraction of spatiotemporal information from satellite imagery, improving flood inundation mapping by leveraging location and time embeddings. Despite their potential, it remains unclear whether GFMs outperform traditional models like U-Net. A systematic comparison across sensors and data availability scenarios is still lacking, which is an essential step to guide end-users in model selection. To address this, we evaluate three GFMs, Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, and UViT (a Prithvi variant), against TransNorm, U-Net, and Attention U-Net using PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. We observe competitive performance among all GFMs, with only 2-5% variation between the best and worst models across sensors. Clay outperforms others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and Sentinel-2 (0.70), while Prithvi leads on Sentinel-1 (0.57). In leave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions, Clay shows slightly better performance across all sensors (mIoU: 0.72(0.04), 0.66(0.07), 0.51(0.08)) compared to Prithvi (0.70(0.05), 0.64(0.09), 0.49(0.13)) and DOFA (0.67(0.07), 0.64(0.04), 0.49(0.09)) for PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1, respectively. Across all 19 sites, leave-one-region-out cross-validation reveals a 4% improvement by Clay compared to U-Net. Visual inspection highlights Clay's superior ability to retain fine details. Few-shot experiments show Clay achieves 0.64 mIoU on PlanetScope with just five training images, outperforming Prithvi (0.24) and DOFA (0.35). In terms of computational time, Clay is a better choice due to its smaller model size (26M parameters), making it ~3x faster than Prithvi (650M) and 2x faster than DOFA (410M). Contrary to previous findings, our results suggest GFMs offer small to moderate improvements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling effort compared to traditional U-Net.</description>

      <title>Locally-Supervised Global Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of image reconstruction from incomplete measurements, encompassing both upsampling and inpainting, within a learning-based framework. Conventional supervised approaches require fully sampled ground truth data, while self-supervised methods allow incomplete ground truth but typically rely on random sampling that, in expectation, covers the entire image. In contrast, we consider fixed, deterministic sampling patterns with inherently incomplete coverage, even in expectation. To overcome this limitation, we exploit multiple invariances of the underlying image distribution, which theoretically allows us to achieve the same reconstruction performance as fully supervised approaches. We validate our method on optical-resolution image upsampling in photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), demonstrating competitive or superior results while requiring substantially less ground truth data.</description>

      <title>Towards Selection of Large Multimodal Models as Engines for Burned-in Protected Health Information Detection in Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of Protected Health Information (PHI) in medical imaging is critical for safeguarding patient privacy and ensuring compliance with regulatory frameworks. Traditional detection methodologies predominantly utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models in conjunction with named entity recognition. However, recent advancements in Large Multimodal Model (LMM) present new opportunities for enhanced text extraction and semantic analysis. In this study, we systematically benchmark three prominent closed and open-sourced LMMs, namely GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5 7B, utilizing two distinct pipeline configurations: one dedicated to text analysis alone and another integrating both OCR and semantic analysis. Our results indicate that LMM exhibits superior OCR efficacy (WER: 0.03-0.05, CER: 0.02-0.03) compared to conventional models like EasyOCR. However, this improvement in OCR performance does not consistently correlate with enhanced overall PHI detection accuracy. The strongest performance gains are observed on test cases with complex imprint patterns. In scenarios where text regions are well readable with sufficient contrast, and strong LMMs are employed for text analysis after OCR, different pipeline configurations yield similar results. Furthermore, we provide empirically grounded recommendations for LMM selection tailored to specific operational constraints and propose a deployment strategy that leverages scalable and modular infrastructure.</description>

      <title>StrengthSense: A Dataset of IMU Signals Capturing Everyday Strength-Demanding Activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracking strength-demanding activities with wearable sensors like IMUs is crucial for monitoring muscular strength, endurance, and power. However, there is a lack of comprehensive datasets capturing these activities. To fill this gap, we introduce \textit{StrengthSense}, an open dataset that encompasses IMU signals capturing 11 strength-demanding activities, such as sit-to-stand, climbing stairs, and mopping. For comparative purposes, the dataset also includes 2 non-strength demanding activities. The dataset was collected from 29 healthy subjects utilizing 10 IMUs placed on limbs and the torso, and was annotated using video recordings as references. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the data collection, pre-processing, and technical validation. We conducted a comparative analysis between the joint angles estimated by IMUs and those directly extracted from video to verify the accuracy and reliability of the sensor data. Researchers and developers can utilize \textit{StrengthSense} to advance the development of human activity recognition algorithms, create fitness and health monitoring applications, and more.</description>

      <title>Text-VQA Aug: Pipelined Harnessing of Large Multimodal Models for Automated Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creation of large-scale databases for Visual Question Answering tasks pertaining to the text data in a scene (text-VQA) involves skilful human annotation, which is tedious and challenging. With the advent of foundation models that handle vision and language modalities, and with the maturity of OCR systems, it is the need of the hour to establish an end-to-end pipeline that can synthesize Question-Answer (QA) pairs based on scene-text from a given image. We propose a pipeline for automated synthesis for text-VQA dataset that can produce faithful QA pairs, and which scales up with the availability of scene text data. Our proposed method harnesses the capabilities of multiple models and algorithms involving OCR detection and recognition (text spotting), region of interest (ROI) detection, caption generation, and question generation. These components are streamlined into a cohesive pipeline to automate the synthesis and validation of QA pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first pipeline proposed to automatically synthesize and validate a large-scale text-VQA dataset comprising around 72K QA pairs based on around 44K images.</description>

      <title>Markerless Augmented Reality Registration for Surgical Guidance: A Multi-Anatomy Clinical Accuracy Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: In this paper, we develop and clinically evaluate a depth-only, markerless augmented reality (AR) registration pipeline on a head-mounted display, and assess accuracy across small or low-curvature anatomies in real-life operative settings. Methods: On HoloLens 2, we align Articulated HAnd Tracking (AHAT) depth to Computed Tomography (CT)-derived skin meshes via (i) depth-bias correction, (ii) brief human-in-the-loop initialization, (iii) global and local registration. We validated the surface-tracing error metric by comparing "skin-to-bone" relative distances to CT ground truth on leg and foot models, using an AR-tracked tool. We then performed seven intraoperative target trials (feet x2, ear x3, leg x2) during the initial stage of fibula free-flap harvest and mandibular reconstruction surgery, and collected 500+ data per trial. Results: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement between AR-traced and CT distances (leg: median |Delta d| 0.78 mm, RMSE 0.97 mm; feet: 0.80 mm, 1.20 mm). Clinically, per-point error had a median of 3.9 mm. Median errors by anatomy were 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), and 5.3 mm (lower leg), with 5 mm coverage 92-95%, 84-90%, and 72-86%, respectively. Feet vs. lower leg differed significantly (Delta median ~1.1 mm; p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: A depth-only, markerless AR pipeline on HMDs achieved ~3-4 mm median error across feet, ear, and lower leg in live surgical settings without fiducials, approaching typical clinical error thresholds for moderate-risk tasks. Human-guided initialization plus global-to-local registration enabled accurate alignment on small or low-curvature targets, improving the clinical readiness of markerless AR guidance.</description>

      <title>From Instance Segmentation to 3D Growth Trajectory Reconstruction in Planktonic Foraminifera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planktonic foraminifera, marine protists characterized by their intricate chambered shells, serve as valuable indicators of past and present environmental conditions. Understanding their chamber growth trajectory provides crucial insights into organismal development and ecological adaptation under changing environments. However, automated tracing of chamber growth from imaging data remains largely unexplored, with existing approaches relying heavily on manual segmentation of each chamber, which is time-consuming and subjective. In this study, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that integrates instance segmentation, a computer vision technique not extensively explored in foraminifera, with a dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically reconstruct three-dimensional growth trajectories from high-resolution computed tomography scans. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate multiple instance segmentation methods, each optimized for distinct spatial features of the chambers, and examine their downstream influence on growth-order reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on expert-annotated datasets demonstrate that the proposed pipeline substantially reduces manual effort while maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Although segmentation models exhibit under-segmentation in smaller chambers due to reduced voxel fidelity and subtle inter-chamber connectivity, the chamber-ordering algorithm remains robust, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental trajectories even under partial segmentation. This work provides the first fully automated and reproducible pipeline for digital foraminiferal growth analysis, establishing a foundation for large-scale, data-driven ecological studies.</description>

      <title>Fast Measuring Pavement Crack Width by Cascading Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate quantification of pavement crack width plays a pivotal role in assessing structural integrity and guiding maintenance interventions. However, achieving precise crack width measurements presents significant challenges due to: (1) the complex, non-uniform morphology of crack boundaries, which limits the efficacy of conventional approaches, and (2) the demand for rapid measurement capabilities from arbitrary pixel locations to facilitate comprehensive pavement condition evaluation. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a cascaded framework integrating Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Robust PCA (RPCA) for efficient crack width extraction from digital images. The proposed methodology comprises three sequential stages: (1) initial crack segmentation using established detection algorithms to generate a binary representation, (2) determination of the primary orientation axis for quasi-parallel cracks through PCA, and (3) extraction of the Main Propagation Axis (MPA) for irregular crack geometries using RPCA. Comprehensive evaluations were conducted across three publicly available datasets, demonstrating that the proposed approach achieves superior performance in both computational efficiency and measurement accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Autobiasing Event Cameras for Flickering Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and mitigating flicker effects caused by rapid variations in light intensity is critical for enhancing the performance of event cameras in diverse environments. This paper introduces an innovative autonomous mechanism for tuning the biases of event cameras, effectively addressing flicker across a wide frequency range -25 Hz to 500 Hz. Unlike traditional methods that rely on additional hardware or software for flicker filtering, our approach leverages the event cameras inherent bias settings. Utilizing a simple Convolutional Neural Networks -CNNs, the system identifies instances of flicker in a spatial space and dynamically adjusts specific biases to minimize its impact. The efficacy of this autobiasing system was robustly tested using a face detector framework under both well-lit and low-light conditions, as well as across various frequencies. The results demonstrated significant improvements: enhanced YOLO confidence metrics for face detection, and an increased percentage of frames capturing detected faces. Moreover, the average gradient, which serves as an indicator of flicker presence through edge detection, decreased by 38.2 percent in well-lit conditions and by 53.6 percent in low-light conditions. These findings underscore the potential of our approach to significantly improve the functionality of event cameras in a range of adverse lighting scenarios.</description>

      <title>Pinpointing Trigger Moment for Grounded Video QA: Enhancing Spatio-temporal Grounding in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this technical report, we introduce a framework to address Grounded Video Question Answering (GVQA) task for the ICCV 2025 Perception Test Challenge. The GVQA task demands robust multimodal models capable of complex reasoning over video content, grounding the resulting answers visually, and tracking the referenced objects temporally. To achieve this capability, our proposed approach decomposes the GVQA task into a three-stage pipeline: (1) Video Reasoning \&amp; QA, (2) Spatio-temporal Grounding and (3) Tracking. Our key contribution is the introduction of a trigger moment, derived from our proposed CORTEX prompt, which pinpoints the single most visible frame of a target object to serve as a robust anchor for grounding and tracking. To this end, we achieve the HOTA score of 0.4968, which marks a significant improvement over the previous year's winning score of 0.2704 on GVQA task.</description>

      <title>MM-UNet: Morph Mamba U-shaped Convolutional Networks for Retinal Vessel Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate detection of retinal vessels plays a critical role in reflecting a wide range of health status indicators in the clinical diagnosis of ocular diseases. Recently, advances in deep learning have led to a surge in retinal vessel segmentation methods, which have significantly contributed to the quantitative analysis of vascular morphology. However, retinal vasculature differs significantly from conventional segmentation targets in that it consists of extremely thin and branching structures, whose global morphology varies greatly across images. These characteristics continue to pose challenges to segmentation precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose MM-UNet, a novel architecture tailored for efficient retinal vessel segmentation. The model incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers, which replace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception through morph, state-aware feature sampling. Additionally, Reverse Selective State Guidance modules integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space modeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on two public retinal vessel segmentation datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in segmentation accuracy. Compared to the existing approaches, MM-UNet achieves F1-score gains of 1.64 $\%$ on DRIVE and 1.25 $\%$ on STARE, demonstrating its effectiveness and advancement. The project code is public via https://github.com/liujiawen-jpg/MM-UNet.</description>

      <title>Language-Enhanced Generative Modeling for PET Synthesis from MRI and Blood Biomarkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis heavily relies on amyloid-beta positron emission tomography (Abeta-PET), which is limited by high cost and limited accessibility. This study explores whether Abeta-PET spatial patterns can be predicted from blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) and MRI scans. Methods: We collected Abeta-PET images, T1-weighted MRI scans, and BBMs from 566 participants. A language-enhanced generative model, driven by a large language model (LLM) and multimodal information fusion, was developed to synthesize PET images. Synthesized images were evaluated for image quality, diagnostic consistency, and clinical applicability within a fully automated diagnostic pipeline. Findings: The synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET scans in both structural details (SSIM = 0.920 +/- 0.003) and regional patterns (Pearson's r = 0.955 +/- 0.007). Diagnostic outcomes using synthetic PET show high agreement with real PET-based diagnoses (accuracy = 0.80). Using synthetic PET, we developed a fully automatic AD diagnostic pipeline integrating PET synthesis and classification. The synthetic PET-based model (AUC = 0.78) outperforms T1-based (AUC = 0.68) and BBM-based (AUC = 0.73) models, while combining synthetic PET and BBMs further improved performance (AUC = 0.79). Ablation analysis supports the advantages of LLM integration and prompt engineering. Interpretation: Our language-enhanced generative model synthesizes realistic PET images, enhancing the utility of MRI and BBMs for Abeta spatial pattern assessment and improving the diagnostic workflow for Alzheimer's disease.</description>

      <title>Object-Centric 3D Gaussian Splatting for Strawberry Plant Reconstruction and Phenotyping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strawberries are among the most economically significant fruits in the United States, generating over $2 billion in annual farm-gate sales and accounting for approximately 13% of the total fruit production value. Plant phenotyping plays a vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits such as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional plant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often destructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful frameworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of multi-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable non-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their promise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct the entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise, increases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction framework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment Anything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean strawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate geometric representations while substantially reducing computational time. With a background-free reconstruction, our algorithm can automatically estimate important plant traits, such as plant height and canopy width, using DBSCAN clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experimental results show that our method outperforms conventional pipelines in both accuracy and efficiency, offering a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry plant phenotyping.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Segmental Longitudinal Strain in Transesophageal Echocardiography by Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) of the left ventricle (LV) is an important prognostic indicator for evaluating regional LV dysfunction, in particular for diagnosing and managing myocardial ischemia. Current techniques for strain estimation require significant manual intervention and expertise, limiting their efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring purposes. This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for SLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning (DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL approaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense frame-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point trajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions.
  As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly accessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to generate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with ground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our evaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a mean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.
  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation with our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean difference (95\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%). Incorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of the models in quantifying abnormal deformation. Our findings indicate that integrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Can Foundation Models Revolutionize Mobile AR Sparse Sensing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile sensing systems have long faced a fundamental trade-off between sensing quality and efficiency due to constraints in computation, power, and other limitations. Sparse sensing, which aims to acquire and process only a subset of sensor data, has been a key strategy for maintaining performance under such constraints. However, existing sparse sensing methods often suffer from reduced accuracy, as missing information across space and time introduces uncertainty into many sensing systems. In this work, we investigate whether foundation models can change the landscape of mobile sparse sensing. Using real-world mobile AR data, our evaluations demonstrate that foundation models offer significant improvements in geometry-aware image warping, a central technique for enabling accurate reuse of cross-frame information. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the scalability of foundation model-based sparse sensing and shows its leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction. Collectively, our study reveals critical aspects of the promises and the open challenges of integrating foundation models into mobile sparse sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Attention and Consistent-Guided Fusion of MRI and PET for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, and its early diagnosis is essential for slowing disease progression. Recent studies on multimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising results by integrating multi-scale complementary features. However, most existing approaches primarily emphasize cross-modal complementarity while overlooking the diagnostic importance of modality-specific features. In addition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead to biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and Consistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis. The proposed model introduces a learnable parameter representation (LPR) block to compensate for missing modality information, followed by a shared encoder and modality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific representations. Furthermore, a consistency-guided mechanism is employed to explicitly align the latent distributions across modalities. Experimental results on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior diagnostic performance compared with existing fusion strategies.</description>

      <title>Monocular absolute depth estimation from endoscopy via domain-invariant feature learning and latent consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is a critical task to guide autonomous medical robots. However, obtaining absolute (metric) depth from an endoscopy camera in surgical scenes is difficult, which limits supervised learning of depth on real endoscopic images. Current image-level unsupervised domain adaptation methods translate synthetic images with known depth maps into the style of real endoscopic frames and train depth networks using these translated images with their corresponding depth maps. However a domain gap often remains between real and translated synthetic images. In this paper, we present a latent feature alignment method to improve absolute depth estimation by reducing this domain gap in the context of endoscopic videos of the central airway. Our methods are agnostic to the image translation process and focus on the depth estimation itself. Specifically, the depth network takes translated synthetic and real endoscopic frames as input and learns latent domain-invariant features via adversarial learning and directional feature consistency. The evaluation is conducted on endoscopic videos of central airway phantoms with manually aligned absolute depth maps. Compared to state-of-the-art MDE methods, our approach achieves superior performance on both absolute and relative depth metrics, and consistently improves results across various backbones and pretrained weights.

      <title>Medical Report Generation: A Hierarchical Task Structure-Based Cross-Modal Causal Intervention Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical Report Generation (MRG) is a key part of modern medical diagnostics, as it automatically generates reports from radiological images to reduce radiologists' burden. However, reliable MRG models for lesion description face three main challenges: insufficient domain knowledge understanding, poor text-visual entity embedding alignment, and spurious correlations from cross-modal biases. Previous work only addresses single challenges, while this paper tackles all three via a novel hierarchical task decomposition approach, proposing the HTSC-CIF framework. HTSC-CIF classifies the three challenges into low-, mid-, and high-level tasks: 1) Low-level: align medical entity features with spatial locations to enhance domain knowledge for visual encoders; 2) Mid-level: use Prefix Language Modeling (text) and Masked Image Modeling (images) to boost cross-modal alignment via mutual guidance; 3) High-level: a cross-modal causal intervention module (via front-door intervention) to reduce confounders and improve interpretability. Extensive experiments confirm HTSC-CIF's effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) MRG methods. Code will be made public upon paper acceptance.</description>

      <title>Are Euler angles a useful rotation parameterisation for pose estimation with Normalizing Flows?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object pose estimation is a task that is of central importance in 3D Computer Vision. Given a target image and a canonical pose, a single point estimate may very often be sufficient; however, a probabilistic pose output is related to a number of benefits when pose is not unambiguous due to sensor and projection constraints or inherent object symmetries. With this paper, we explore the usefulness of using the well-known Euler angles parameterisation as a basis for a Normalizing Flows model for pose estimation. Isomorphic to spatial rotation, 3D pose has been parameterized in a number of ways, either in or out of the context of parameter estimation. We explore the idea that Euler angles, despite their shortcomings, may lead to useful models in a number of aspects, compared to a model built on a more complex parameterisation.</description>

      <title>SAIL-RL: Guiding MLLMs in When and How to Think via Dual-Reward RL Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SAIL-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training framework that enhances the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by teaching them when and how to think. Existing approaches are limited by outcome-only supervision, which rewards correct answers without ensuring sound reasoning, and by uniform thinking strategies, which often lead to overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones. SAIL-RL addresses these challenges with a dual reward system: the Thinking Reward, which evaluates reasoning quality through factual grounding, logical coherence, and answer consistency, and the Judging Reward, which adaptively determines whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate. Experiments on the state-of-the-art SAIL-VL2 show that SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal understanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieving competitive performance against commercial closed-source models such as GPT-4o, and substantially reduces hallucinations, establishing it as a principled framework for building more reliable and adaptive MLLMs. The code will be available at https://github.com/BytedanceDouyinContent/SAIL-RL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approach for Handwritten Mathematical Expression (HME) recognition by modeling HMEs as graphs, where nodes represent symbols and edges capture spatial dependencies. A deep BLSTM network is used for symbol segmentation, recognition, and spatial relation classification, forming an initial primitive graph. A 2D-CFG parser then generates all possible spatial relations, while the GNN-based link prediction model refines the structure by removing unnecessary connections, ultimately forming the Symbol Label Graph. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing promising performance in HME structure recognition.</description>

      <title>Cycle-Sync: Robust Global Camera Pose Estimation through Enhanced Cycle-Consistent Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Cycle-Sync, a robust and global framework for estimating camera poses (both rotations and locations). Our core innovation is a location solver that adapts message-passing least squares (MPLS) -- originally developed for group synchronization -- to camera location estimation. We modify MPLS to emphasize cycle-consistent information, redefine cycle consistencies using estimated distances from previous iterations, and incorporate a Welsch-type robust loss. We establish the strongest known deterministic exact-recovery guarantee for camera location estimation, showing that cycle consistency alone -- without access to inter-camera distances -- suffices to achieve the lowest sample complexity currently known. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a plug-and-play outlier rejection module inspired by robust subspace recovery, and we fully integrate cycle consistency into MPLS for rotation synchronization. Our global approach avoids the need for bundle adjustment. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that Cycle-Sync consistently outperforms leading pose estimators, including full structure-from-motion pipelines with bundle adjustment.</description>

      <title>GAFD-CC: Global-Aware Feature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration for OOD Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is paramount to ensuring the reliability and robustness of learning models in real-world applications. Existing post-hoc OOD detection methods detect OOD samples by leveraging their features and logits information without retraining. However, they often overlook the inherent correlation between features and logits, which is crucial for effective OOD detection. To address this limitation, we propose Global-Aware Feature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration (GAFD-CC). GAFD-CC aims to refine decision boundaries and increase discriminative performance. Firstly, it performs global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights. This involves aligning features with the direction of global classification weights to decouple them. From this, GAFD-CC extracts two types of critical information: positively correlated features that promote in-distribution (ID)/OOD boundary refinement and negatively correlated features that suppress false positives and tighten these boundaries. Secondly, it adaptively fuses these decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for comprehensive and robust OOD detection. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate GAFD-CC's competitive performance and strong generalization ability compared to those of state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>M3PD Dataset: Dual-view Photoplethysmography (PPG) Using Front-and-rear Cameras of Smartphones in Lab and Clinical Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portable physiological monitoring is essential for early detection and management of cardiovascular disease, but current methods often require specialized equipment that limits accessibility or impose impractical postures that patients cannot maintain. Video-based photoplethysmography on smartphones offers a convenient noninvasive alternative, yet it still faces reliability challenges caused by motion artifacts, lighting variations, and single-view constraints. Few studies have demonstrated reliable application to cardiovascular patients, and no widely used open datasets exist for cross-device accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce the M3PD dataset, the first publicly available dual-view mobile photoplethysmography dataset, comprising synchronized facial and fingertip videos captured simultaneously via front and rear smartphone cameras from 60 participants (including 47 cardiovascular patients). Building on this dual-view setting, we further propose F3Mamba, which fuses the facial and fingertip views through Mamba-based temporal modeling. The model reduces heart-rate error by 21.9 to 30.2 percent over existing single-view baselines while improving robustness in challenging real-world scenarios.

      <title>CoCoVa: Chain of Continuous Vision-Language Thought for Latent Space Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and beyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world in multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain constrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic tokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous Vision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that leverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks. The core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent Q-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a chain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this process, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual regions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain grounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment between latent representations and both visual and textual modalities. Evaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong baselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B models on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains competitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that learned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns, highlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between discrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.</description>

      <title>RxnCaption: Reformulating Reaction Diagram Parsing as Visual Prompt Guided Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale chemical reaction datasets are crucial for AI research in chemistry. However, existing chemical reaction data often exist as images within papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training machine learning models. In response to this challenge, we propose the RxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP). Our framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing process into an image captioning problem, which Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) handle naturally. We introduce a strategy termed "BBox and Index as Visual Prompt" (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector, MolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the input image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language description problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy significantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model design. We further construct the RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude larger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset across four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics. We believe our method, dataset, and models will advance structured information extraction from chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry. We will release data, models, and code on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Moving Object Segmentation of Sparse and Noisy Radar Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for safe and reliable autonomous mobile systems like self-driving cars, improving the reliability and robustness of subsequent tasks like SLAM or path planning. While the segmentation of camera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often introduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal sequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this problem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler velocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation. However, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation for use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and cost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of self-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point clouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised representation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited amounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss function with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain the network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data. Our method improves label efficiency after fine-tuning, effectively boosting state-of-the-art performance by self-supervised pretraining.</description>

      <title>A Novel Grouping-Based Hybrid Color Correction Algorithm for Color Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color consistency correction for color point clouds is a fundamental yet important task in 3D rendering and compression applications. In the past, most previous color correction methods aimed at correcting color for color images. The purpose of this paper is to propose a grouping-based hybrid color correction algorithm for color point clouds. Our algorithm begins by estimating the overlapping rate between the aligned source and target point clouds, and then adaptively partitions the target points into two groups, namely the close proximity group Gcl and the moderate proximity group Gmod, or three groups, namely Gcl, Gmod, and the distant proximity group Gdist, when the estimated overlapping rate is low or high, respectively. To correct color for target points in Gcl, a K-nearest neighbors based bilateral interpolation (KBI) method is proposed. To correct color for target points in Gmod, a joint KBI and the histogram equalization (JKHE) method is proposed. For target points in Gdist, a histogram equalization (HE) method is proposed for color correction. Finally, we discuss the grouping-effect free property and the ablation study in our algorithm. The desired color consistency correction benefit of our algorithm has been justified through 1086 testing color point cloud pairs against the state-of-the-art methods. The C++ source code of our algorithm can be accessed from the website: https://github.com/ivpml84079/Point-cloud-color-correction.</description>

      <title>Purrturbed but Stable: Human-Cat Invariant Representations Across CNNs, ViTs and Self-Supervised ViTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cats and humans differ in ocular anatomy. Most notably, Felis Catus (domestic cats) have vertically elongated pupils linked to ambush predation; yet, how such specializations manifest in downstream visual representations remains incompletely understood. We present a unified, frozen-encoder benchmark that quantifies feline-human cross-species representational alignment in the wild, across convolutional networks, supervised Vision Transformers, windowed transformers, and self-supervised ViTs (DINO), using layer-wise Centered Kernel Alignment (linear and RBF) and Representational Similarity Analysis, with additional distributional and stability tests reported in the paper. Across models, DINO ViT-B/16 attains the most substantial alignment (mean CKA-RBF $\approx0.814$, mean CKA-linear $\approx0.745$, mean RSA $\approx0.698$), peaking at early blocks, indicating that token-level self-supervision induces early-stage features that bridge species-specific statistics. Supervised ViTs are competitive on CKA yet show weaker geometric correspondence than DINO (e.g., ViT-B/16 RSA $\approx0.53$ at block8; ViT-L/16 $\approx0.47$ at block14), revealing depth-dependent divergences between similarity and representational geometry. CNNs remain strong baselines but below plain ViTs on alignment, and windowed transformers underperform plain ViTs, implicating architectural inductive biases in cross-species alignment. Results indicate that self-supervision coupled with ViT inductive biases yields representational geometries that more closely align feline and human visual systems than widely used CNNs and windowed Transformers, providing testable neuroscientific hypotheses about where and how cross-species visual computations converge. We release our code and dataset for reference and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>IllumFlow: Illumination-Adaptive Low-Light Enhancement via Conditional Rectified Flow and Retinex Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present IllumFlow, a novel framework that synergizes conditional Rectified Flow (CRF) with Retinex theory for low-light image enhancement (LLIE). Our model addresses low-light enhancement through separate optimization of illumination and reflectance components, effectively handling both lighting variations and noise. Specifically, we first decompose an input image into reflectance and illumination components following Retinex theory. To model the wide dynamic range of illumination variations in low-light images, we propose a conditional rectified flow framework that represents illumination changes as a continuous flow field. While complex noise primarily resides in the reflectance component, we introduce a denoising network, enhanced by flow-derived data augmentation, to remove reflectance noise and chromatic aberration while preserving color fidelity. IllumFlow enables precise illumination adaptation across lighting conditions while naturally supporting customizable brightness enhancement. Extensive experiments on low-light enhancement and exposure correction demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance over existing methods.</description>

      <title>ChartM$^3$: A Multi-Stage Code-Driven Pipeline for Constructing Multi-Dimensional and Multi-Step Visual Reasoning Data in Chart Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex chart understanding tasks demand advanced visual recognition and reasoning capabilities from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, current research provides limited coverage of complex chart scenarios and computation-intensive reasoning tasks prevalent in real-world applications. This study proposes an automated multi-stage code-driven pipeline for systematically generating visual reasoning datasets to address these limitations. The pipeline integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve professional chart templates and employs chain-of-thought (CoT) strategies to generate reasoning codes that simulate real data distributions, thereby driving chart rendering and question-related statistical computations. Through model-based evaluation, the pipeline enhances chart diversity and data quality. Using this framework, we construct ChartM$^3$, a multi-dimensional and multi-step dataset containing 38K charts and 142K Q&amp;A pairs for training, along with 2,871 high-quality evaluation samples for enabling practical performance assessment. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves reasoning capabilities and cross-domain generalization performance, enabling smaller models to achieve performance comparable to larger-scale models in complex chart comprehension.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Crop-Weed Image Generation and its Impact on Model Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise semantic segmentation of crops and weeds is necessary for agricultural weeding robots. However, training deep learning models requires large annotated datasets, which are costly to obtain in real fields. Synthetic data can reduce this burden, but the gap between simulated and real images remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a pipeline for procedural generation of synthetic crop-weed images using Blender, producing annotated datasets under diverse conditions of plant growth, weed density, lighting, and camera angle. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models on synthetic and real datasets and analyze their cross-domain generalization. Our results show that training on synthetic images leads to a sim-to-real gap of 10%, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, synthetic data demonstrates good generalization properties, outperforming real datasets in cross-domain scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic agricultural datasets and support hybrid strategies for more efficient model training.</description>

      <title>From the Laboratory to Real-World Application: Evaluating Zero-Shot Scene Interpretation on Edge Devices for Mobile Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Understanding, Scene Interpretation and Commonsense Reasoning are highly challenging tasks enabling the interpretation of visual information, allowing agents to perceive, interact with and make rational decisions in its environment. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in these areas in recent years, enabling domain-specific applications as well as zero-shot open vocabulary tasks, combining multiple domains. However, the required computational complexity poses challenges for their application on edge devices and in the context of Mobile Robotics, especially considering the trade-off between accuracy and inference time. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of state-of-the-art VLMs for the task of Scene Interpretation and Action Recognition, with special regard to small VLMs capable of being deployed to edge devices in the context of Mobile Robotics. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on a diverse dataset consisting of various real-world cityscape, on-campus and indoor scenarios. The experimental evaluation discusses the potential of these small models on edge devices, with particular emphasis on challenges, weaknesses, inherent model biases and the application of the gained information.

      <title>KAO: Kernel-Adaptive Optimization in Diffusion for Satellite Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite image inpainting is a crucial task in remote sensing, where accurately restoring missing or occluded regions is essential for robust image analysis. In this paper, we propose KAO, a novel framework that utilizes Kernel-Adaptive Optimization within diffusion models for satellite image inpainting. KAO is specifically designed to address the challenges posed by very high-resolution (VHR) satellite datasets, such as DeepGlobe and the Massachusetts Roads Dataset. Unlike existing methods that rely on preconditioned models requiring extensive retraining or postconditioned models with significant computational overhead, KAO introduces a Latent Space Conditioning approach, optimizing a compact latent space to achieve efficient and accurate inpainting. Furthermore, we incorporate Explicit Propagation into the diffusion process, facilitating forward-backward fusion, which improves the stability and precision of the method. Experimental results demonstrate that KAO sets a new benchmark for VHR satellite image restoration, providing a scalable, high-performance solution that balances the efficiency of preconditioned models with the flexibility of postconditioned models.</description>

      <title>MVAFormer: RGB-based Multi-View Spatio-Temporal Action Recognition with Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-view action recognition aims to recognize human actions using multiple camera views and deals with occlusion caused by obstacles or crowds. In this task, cooperation among views, which generates a joint representation by combining multiple views, is vital. Previous studies have explored promising cooperation methods for improving performance. However, since their methods focus only on the task setting of recognizing a single action from an entire video, they are not applicable to the recently popular spatio-temporal action recognition~(STAR) setting, in which each person's action is recognized sequentially. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view action recognition method for the STAR setting, called MVAFormer. In MVAFormer, we introduce a novel transformer-based cooperation module among views. In contrast to previous studies, which utilize embedding vectors with lost spatial information, our module utilizes the feature map for effective cooperation in the STAR setting, which preserves the spatial information. Furthermore, in our module, we divide the self-attention for the same and different views to model the relationship between multiple views effectively. The results of experiments using a newly collected dataset demonstrate that MVAFormer outperforms the comparison baselines by approximately $4.4$ points on the F-measure.</description>

      <title>OLATverse: A Large-scale Real-world Object Dataset with Precise Lighting Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce OLATverse, a large-scale dataset comprising around 9M images of 765 real-world objects, captured from multiple viewpoints under a diverse set of precisely controlled lighting conditions. While recent advances in object-centric inverse rendering, novel view synthesis and relighting have shown promising results, most techniques still heavily rely on the synthetic datasets for training and small-scale real-world datasets for benchmarking, which limits their realism and generalization. To address this gap, OLATverse offers two key advantages over existing datasets: large-scale coverage of real objects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations. Specifically, OLATverse contains 765 common and uncommon real-world objects, spanning a wide range of material categories. Each object is captured using 35 DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the simulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we provide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric surface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct an extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world object-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation. We believe that OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating the next generation of inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data. The full dataset, along with all post-processing workflows, will be publicly released at https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/OLATverse/.</description>

      <title>Object Detection as an Optional Basis: A Graph Matching Network for Cross-View UAV Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, UAVs have become crucial for measurement and tracking in patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied areas, satellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents a cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object detection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view, heterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual localization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are extracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is estimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because publicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches recast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these datasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain differences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations, or generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment, content loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object detection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite images, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and intra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based node-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization performance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that our approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and generalizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps, such as infrared-visible image matching. Our dataset will be publicly available at the following URL: https://github.com/liutao23/ODGNNLoc.git.</description>

      <title>DetectiumFire: A Comprehensive Multi-modal Dataset Bridging Vision and Language for Fire Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal models have demonstrated strong performance in tasks such as image generation and reasoning. However, applying these models to the fire domain remains challenging due to the lack of publicly available datasets with high-quality fire domain annotations. To address this gap, we introduce DetectiumFire, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset comprising of 22.5k high-resolution fire-related images and 2.5k real-world fire-related videos covering a wide range of fire types, environments, and risk levels. The data are annotated with both traditional computer vision labels (e.g., bounding boxes) and detailed textual prompts describing the scene, enabling applications such as synthetic data generation and fire risk reasoning. DetectiumFire offers clear advantages over existing benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data quality, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing coverage of real-world scenarios. We validate the utility of DetectiumFire across multiple tasks, including object detection, diffusion-based image generation, and vision-language reasoning. Our results highlight the potential of this dataset to advance fire-related research and support the development of intelligent safety systems. We release DetectiumFire to promote broader exploration of fire understanding in the AI community. The dataset is available at https://kaggle.com/datasets/38b79c344bdfc55d1eed3d22fbaa9c31fad45e27edbbe9e3c529d6e5c4f93890</description>

      <title>Adapting General-Purpose Foundation Models for X-ray Ptychography in Low-Data Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where foundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for specialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation strategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this benchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies on a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter recommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that the optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT and ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by context-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of 0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the superior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a powerful "super-expert" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm the superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual interference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked against strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer key observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our benchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for developing more effective science-based agentic systems.</description>

      <title>ESA: Energy-Based Shot Assembly Optimization for Automatic Video Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shot assembly is a crucial step in film production and video editing, involving the sequencing and arrangement of shots to construct a narrative, convey information, or evoke emotions. Traditionally, this process has been manually executed by experienced editors. While current intelligent video editing technologies can handle some automated video editing tasks, they often fail to capture the creator's unique artistic expression in shot assembly.To address this challenge, we propose an energy-based optimization method for video shot assembly. Specifically, we first perform visual-semantic matching between the script generated by a large language model and a video library to obtain subsets of candidate shots aligned with the script semantics. Next, we segment and label the shots from reference videos, extracting attributes such as shot size, camera motion, and semantics. We then employ energy-based models to learn from these attributes, scoring candidate shot sequences based on their alignment with reference styles. Finally, we achieve shot assembly optimization by combining multiple syntax rules, producing videos that align with the assembly style of the reference videos. Our method not only automates the arrangement and combination of independent shots according to specific logic, narrative requirements, or artistic styles but also learns the assembly style of reference videos, creating a coherent visual sequence or holistic visual expression. With our system, even users with no prior video editing experience can create visually compelling videos. Project page: https://sobeymil.github.io/esa.com</description>

      <title>Keeping it Local, Tiny and Real: Automated Report Generation on Edge Computing Devices for Mechatronic-Based Cognitive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning enable hardware-based cognitive systems, that is, mechatronic systems in general and robotics in particular with integrated Artificial Intelligence, to interact with dynamic and unstructured environments. While the results are impressive, the application of such systems to critical tasks like autonomous driving as well as service and care robotics necessitate the evaluation of large amount of heterogeneous data. Automated report generation for Mobile Robotics can play a crucial role in facilitating the evaluation and acceptance of such systems in various domains. In this paper, we propose a pipeline for generating automated reports in natural language utilizing various multi-modal sensors that solely relies on local models capable of being deployed on edge computing devices, thus preserving the privacy of all actors involved and eliminating the need for external services. In particular, we evaluate our implementation on a diverse dataset spanning multiple domains including indoor, outdoor and urban environments, providing quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation results. Various generated example reports and other supplementary materials are available via a public repository.</description>

      <title>LiteVoxel: Low-memory Intelligent Thresholding for Efficient Voxel Rasterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse-voxel rasterization is a fast, differentiable alternative for optimization-based scene reconstruction, but it tends to underfit low-frequency content, depends on brittle pruning heuristics, and can overgrow in ways that inflate VRAM. We introduce LiteVoxel, a self-tuning training pipeline that makes SV rasterization both steadier and lighter. Our loss is made low-frequency aware via an inverse-Sobel reweighting with a mid-training gamma-ramp, shifting gradient budget to flat regions only after geometry stabilize. Adaptation replaces fixed thresholds with a depth-quantile pruning logic on maximum blending weight, stabilized by EMA-hysteresis guards and refines structure through ray-footprint-based, priority-driven subdivision under an explicit growth budget. Ablations and full-system results across Mip-NeRF 360 (6scenes) and Tanks &amp; Temples (3scenes) datasets show mitigation of errors in low-frequency regions and boundary instability while keeping PSNR/SSIM, training time, and FPS comparable to a strong SVRaster pipeline. Crucially, LiteVoxel reduces peak VRAM by ~40%-60% and preserves low-frequency detail that prior setups miss, enabling more predictable, memory-efficient training without sacrificing perceptual quality.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning for Industrial Defect Detection: A Case Study on Shearographic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shearography is a non-destructive testing method for detecting subsurface defects, offering high sensitivity and full-field inspection capabilities. However, its industrial adoption remains limited due to the need for expert interpretation. To reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation, this study explores unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in shearographic images. Three architectures are evaluated: a fully connected autoencoder, a convolutional autoencoder, and a student-teacher feature matching model. All models are trained solely on defect-free data. A controlled dataset was developed using a custom specimen with reproducible defect patterns, enabling systematic acquisition of shearographic measurements under both ideal and realistic deformation conditions. Two training subsets were defined: one containing only undistorted, defect-free samples, and one additionally including globally deformed, yet defect-free, data. The latter simulates practical inspection conditions by incorporating deformation-induced fringe patterns that may obscure localized anomalies. The models are evaluated in terms of binary classification and, for the student-teacher model, spatial defect localization. Results show that the student-teacher approach achieves superior classification robustness and enables precise localization. Compared to the autoencoder-based models, it demonstrates improved separability of feature representations, as visualized through t-SNE embeddings. Additionally, a YOLOv8 model trained on labeled defect data serves as a reference to benchmark localization quality. This study underscores the potential of unsupervised deep learning for scalable, label-efficient shearographic inspection in industrial environments.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Future Anatomies: Longitudianl Brain Mri-to-Mri Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting future brain state from a baseline magnetic resonance image (MRI) is a central challenge in neuroimaging and has important implications for studying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most existing approaches predict future cognitive scores or clinical outcomes, such as conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Instead, here we investigate longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction that forecasts a participant's entire brain MRI several years into the future, intrinsically modeling complex, spatially distributed neurodegenerative patterns. We implement and evaluate five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR, Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL). Predicted follow-up MRIs are directly compared with the actual follow-up scans using metrics that capture global similarity and local differences. The best performing models achieve high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalize well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort performance. Our results indicate that deep learning can reliably predict participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities for individualized prognosis.</description>

      <title>The Urban Vision Hackathon Dataset and Models: Towards Image Annotations and Accurate Vision Models for Indian Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report describes the UVH-26 dataset, the first public release by AIM@IISc of a large-scale dataset of annotated traffic-camera images from India. The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from 2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently annotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from across India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14 vehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler (Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller, Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k consensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct objects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further, we train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X, and DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50, mAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in mAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with RT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40 for COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This demonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic scenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus annotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the 6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera streams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and offers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic conditions.</description>

      <title>Seeing Across Time and Views: Multi-Temporal Cross-View Learning for Robust Video Person Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video-based person re-identification (ReID) in cross-view domains (for example, aerial-ground surveillance) remains an open problem because of extreme viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies. To address these challenges, we propose MTF-CVReID, a parameter-efficient framework that introduces seven complementary modules over a ViT-B/16 backbone. Specifically, we include: (1) Cross-Stream Feature Normalization (CSFN) to correct camera and view biases; (2) Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization (MRFH) for scale stabilization across altitudes; (3) Identity-Aware Memory Module (IAMM) to reinforce persistent identity traits; (4) Temporal Dynamics Modeling (TDM) for motion-aware short-term temporal encoding; (5) Inter-View Feature Alignment (IVFA) for perspective-invariant representation alignment; (6) Hierarchical Temporal Pattern Learning (HTPL) to capture multi-scale temporal regularities; and (7) Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning (MVICL) that enforces cross-view identity coherence using a contrastive learning paradigm. Despite adding only about 2 million parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs over the baseline, MTF-CVReID maintains real-time efficiency (189 FPS) and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude levels, with strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS datasets. These results show that carefully designed adapter-based modules can substantially enhance cross-view robustness and temporal consistency without compromising computational efficiency.

      <title>A Cognitive Process-Inspired Architecture for Subject-Agnostic Brain Visual Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subject-agnostic brain decoding, which aims to reconstruct continuous visual experiences from fMRI without subject-specific training, holds great potential for clinical applications. However, this direction remains underexplored due to challenges in cross-subject generalization and the complex nature of brain signals. In this work, we propose Visual Cortex Flow Architecture (VCFlow), a novel hierarchical decoding framework that explicitly models the ventral-dorsal architecture of the human visual system to learn multi-dimensional representations. By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary cognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the extraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing subject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike conventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and heavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\% accuracy on average yet generates each reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast and clinically scalable solution. The source code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.</description>

      <title>TAUE: Training-free Noise Transplant and Cultivation Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of text-to-image diffusion models, their output of a single, flattened image remains a critical bottleneck for professional applications requiring layer-wise control. Existing solutions either rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are training-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing to produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique, Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent representations from both foreground and composite generation processes, transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods, enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative workflows.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-animal tracking is crucial for understanding animal ecology and behavior. However, it remains a challenging task due to variations in habitat, motion patterns, and species appearance. Traditional approaches typically require extensive model fine-tuning and heuristic design for each application scenario. In this work, we explore the potential of recent vision foundation models for zero-shot multi-animal tracking. By combining a Grounding Dino object detector with the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) tracker and carefully designed heuristics, we develop a tracking framework that can be applied to new datasets without any retraining or hyperparameter adaptation. Evaluations on ChimpAct, Bird Flock Tracking, AnimalTrack, and a subset of GMOT-40 demonstrate strong and consistent performance across diverse species and environments. The code is available at https://github.com/ecker-lab/SAM2-Animal-Tracking.</description>

      <title>UniChange: Unifying Change Detection with Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task for monitoring and analyzing land cover dynamics. While recent high performance models and high quality datasets have significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current models typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and cannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic change detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization and limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We leverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop UniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange integrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities. Our model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction of three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange utilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories, eliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows UniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even when their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks (WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance, achieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively, surpassing all previous methods.

      <title>Robust Face Liveness Detection for Biometric Authentication using Single Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biometric technologies are widely adopted in security, legal, and financial systems. Face recognition can authenticate a person based on the unique facial features such as shape and texture. However, recent works have demonstrated the vulnerability of Face Recognition Systems (FRS) towards presentation attacks. Using spoofing (aka.,presentation attacks), a malicious actor can get illegitimate access to secure systems. This paper proposes a novel light-weight CNN framework to identify print/display, video and wrap attacks. The proposed robust architecture provides seamless liveness detection ensuring faster biometric authentication (1-2 seconds on CPU). Further, this also presents a newly created 2D spoof attack dataset consisting of more than 500 videos collected from 60 subjects. To validate the effectiveness of this architecture, we provide a demonstration video depicting print/display, video and wrap attack detection approaches. The demo can be viewed in the following link: https://rak.box.com/s/m1uf31fn5amtjp4mkgf1huh4ykfeibaa</description>

      <title>Can Visual Input Be Compressed? A Visual Token Compression Benchmark for Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) often suffer from severe inference inefficiency due to the large number of visual tokens introduced by image encoders. While recent token compression methods, such as pruning and merging, have shown promise in reducing redundancy, their evaluation remains fragmented and inconsistent. In this work, we present UniPruneBench, a unified and extensible benchmark for visual token pruning in multimodal LLMs. UniPruneBench provides standardized protocols across six ability dimensions and ten datasets, covering ten representative compression algorithms and three families of LMMs (LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3, and Qwen2.5-VL). Beyond task accuracy, it incorporates system-level metrics such as runtime and prefilling latency to provide a holistic view. Our experiments uncover several key findings: (1) random pruning is a surprisingly strong baseline, (2) no single method consistently outperforms others across scenarios, (3) pruning sensitivity varies significantly across tasks, with OCR being most vulnerable, and (4) pruning ratio is the dominant factor governing performance degradation. We believe UniPruneBench will serve as a reliable foundation for future research on efficient multimodal modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformers rely on fixed patch tokens that ignore the spatial and semantic structure of images. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end differentiable tokenizer that adapts to image content with pixel-level granularity while remaining backward-compatible with existing architectures for retrofitting pretrained models. Our method uses hierarchical model selection with information criteria to provide competitive performance in both image-level classification and dense-prediction tasks, and even supports out-of-the-box raster-to-vector conversion.</description>

      <title>Modality-Transition Representation Learning for Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) technique could associate the pedestrian images across visible and infrared modalities in the practical scenarios of background illumination changes. However, a substantial gap inherently exists between these two modalities. Besides, existing methods primarily rely on intermediate representations to align cross-modal features of the same person. The intermediate feature representations are usually create by generating intermediate images (kind of data enhancement), or fusing intermediate features (more parameters, lack of interpretability), and they do not make good use of the intermediate features. Thus, we propose a novel VI-ReID framework via Modality-Transition Representation Learning (MTRL) with a middle generated image as a transmitter from visible to infrared modals, which are fully aligned with the original visible images and similar to the infrared modality. After that, using a modality-transition contrastive loss and a modality-query regularization loss for training, which could align the cross-modal features more effectively. Notably, our proposed framework does not need any additional parameters, which achieves the same inference speed to the backbone while improving its performance on VI-ReID task. Extensive experimental results illustrate that our model significantly and consistently outperforms existing SOTAs on three typical VI-ReID datasets.</description>

      <title>VidEmo: Affective-Tree Reasoning for Emotion-Centric Video Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting emotion from videos has gathered significant attention in recent studies, driven by advancements in video large language models (VideoLLMs). While advanced methods have made progress in video emotion analysis, the intrinsic nature of emotions poses significant challenges. Emotions are characterized by dynamic and cues-dependent properties, making it difficult to understand complex and evolving emotional states with reasonable rationale. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel affective cues-guided reasoning framework that unifies fundamental attribute perception, expression analysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise manner. At the core of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo), specifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These models undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning for injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement learning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data infrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG) consisting of 2.1M diverse instruction-based samples. Emo-CFG includes explainable emotional question-answering, fine-grained captions, and associated rationales, providing essential resources for advancing emotion understanding tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance, setting a new milestone across 15 face perception tasks.</description>

      <title>LLEXICORP: End-user Explainability of Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision systems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to explain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works suggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be attributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance propagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find images that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are largely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered concepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting the accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.
  To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept Relevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a multimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive names to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that translate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To ensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the semantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and explanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences, offering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries for non-technical stakeholders.
  We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a VGG16 model. Our findings suggest that integrating concept-based attribution methods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to interpreting deep neural networks, paving the way for more transparent AI systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Reflections: Probing Video Representations with Text Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The alignment of representations from different modalities has recently been shown to provide insights on the structural similarities and downstream capabilities of different encoders across diverse data types. While significant progress has been made in aligning images with text, the temporal nature of video data remains largely unexplored in this context. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, probing the capabilities of modern video and language encoders. Our findings reveal several key insights. First, we demonstrate that cross-modal alignment highly depends on the richness of both visual (static images vs. multi-frame videos) and text (single caption vs. a collection) data provided at test time, especially when using state-of-the-art video encoders. We propose parametric test-time scaling laws that capture this behavior and show remarkable predictive power against empirical observations. Secondly, we investigate the correlation between semantic alignment and performance on both semantic and non-semantic downstream tasks, providing initial evidence that strong alignment against text encoders may be linked to general-purpose video representation and understanding. Finally, we correlate temporal reasoning with cross-modal alignment providing a challenging test-bed for vision and language models. Overall, our work introduces video-text alignment as an informative zero-shot way to probe the representation power of different encoders for spatio-temporal data.

      <title>PercHead: Perceptual Head Model for Single-Image 3D Head Reconstruction &amp; Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PercHead, a method for single-image 3D head reconstruction and semantic 3D editing - two tasks that are inherently challenging due to severe view occlusions, weak perceptual supervision, and the ambiguity of editing in 3D space. We develop a unified base model for reconstructing view-consistent 3D heads from a single input image. The model employs a dual-branch encoder followed by a ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features into 3D space through iterative cross-attention. Rendering is performed using Gaussian Splatting. At the heart of our approach is a novel perceptual supervision strategy based on DINOv2 and SAM2.1, which provides rich, generalized signals for both geometric and appearance fidelity. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis and, furthermore, exhibits exceptional robustness to extreme viewing angles compared to established baselines. Furthermore, this base model can be seamlessly extended for semantic 3D editing by swapping the encoder and finetuning the network. In this variant, we disentangle geometry and style through two distinct input modalities: a segmentation map to control geometry and either a text prompt or a reference image to specify appearance. We highlight the intuitive and powerful 3D editing capabilities of our model through a lightweight, interactive GUI, where users can effortlessly sculpt geometry by drawing segmentation maps and stylize appearance via natural language or image prompts.

      <title>VCode: a Multimodal Coding Benchmark with SVG as Symbolic Visual Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action in the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically, frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i) Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on rendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual representation. The benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/CSU-JPG/VCode.</description>

      <title>When Visualizing is the First Step to Reasoning: MIRA, a Benchmark for Visual Chain-of-Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose MIRA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate models in scenarios where generating intermediate visual images is essential for successful reasoning. Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in MIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as sketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning process. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through "drawing to think". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically challenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning steps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our evaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems, annotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a unified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation input: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with image and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image clues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity on our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under different k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large language models, including strongest private models as well as strong open-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts. However, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves consistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and tasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and designing textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited improvements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the critical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning on MIRA.</description>

      <title>AI-Generated Image Detection: An Empirical Study and Future Research Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The threats posed by AI-generated media, particularly deepfakes, are now raising significant challenges for multimedia forensics, misinformation detection, and biometric system resulting in erosion of public trust in the legal system, significant increase in frauds, and social engineering attacks. Although several forensic methods have been proposed, they suffer from three critical gaps: (i) use of non-standardized benchmarks with GAN- or diffusion-generated images, (ii) inconsistent training protocols (e.g., scratch, frozen, fine-tuning), and (iii) limited evaluation metrics that fail to capture generalization and explainability. These limitations hinder fair comparison, obscure true robustness, and restrict deployment in security-critical applications. This paper introduces a unified benchmarking framework for systematic evaluation of forensic methods under controlled and reproducible conditions. We benchmark ten SoTA forensic methods (scratch, frozen, and fine-tuned) and seven publicly available datasets (GAN and diffusion) to perform extensive and systematic evaluations. We evaluate performance using multiple metrics, including accuracy, average precision, ROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity. We also further analyze model interpretability using confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps. Our evaluations demonstrate substantial variability in generalization, with certain methods exhibiting strong in-distribution performance but degraded cross-model transferability. This study aims to guide the research community toward a deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of current forensic approaches, and to inspire the development of more robust, generalizable, and explainable solutions.</description>

      <title>PLUTO-4: Frontier Pathology Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models trained on large-scale pathology image corpora have demonstrated strong transfer capabilities across diverse histopathology tasks. Building on this progress, we introduce PLUTO-4, our next generation of pathology foundation models that extend the Pathology-Universal Transformer (PLUTO) to frontier scale. We share two complementary Vision Transformer architectures in the PLUTO-4 family: a compact and efficient PLUTO-4S model optimized for multi-scale deployment using a FlexiViT setup with 2D-RoPE embeddings, and a frontier-scale PLUTO-4G model trained with a single patch size to maximize representation capacity and stability. Both models are pretrained using a self-supervised objective derived from DINOv2 on a large multi-institutional corpus containing 551,164 WSIs from 137,144 patients across over 50 institutions, spanning over 60 disease types and over 100 stains. Comprehensive evaluation across public and internal benchmarks demonstrates that PLUTO-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring varying spatial and biological context, including patch-level classification, segmentation, and slide-level diagnosis. The compact PLUTO-4S provides high-throughput and robust performance for practical deployment, while PLUTO-4G establishes new performance frontiers across multiple pathology benchmarks, including an 11% improvement in dermatopathology diagnosis. These diverse improvements underscore PLUTO-4's potential to transform real-world applications as a backbone for translational research and diagnostic use cases.</description>

      <title>Densemarks: Learning Canonical Embeddings for Human Heads Images via Point Tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose DenseMarks - a new learned representation for human heads, enabling high-quality dense correspondences of human head images. For a 2D image of a human head, a Vision Transformer network predicts a 3D embedding for each pixel, which corresponds to a location in a 3D canonical unit cube. In order to train our network, we collect a dataset of pairwise point matches, estimated by a state-of-the-art point tracker over a collection of diverse in-the-wild talking heads videos, and guide the mapping via a contrastive loss, encouraging matched points to have close embeddings. We further employ multi-task learning with face landmarks and segmentation constraints, as well as imposing spatial continuity of embeddings through latent cube features, which results in an interpretable and queryable canonical space. The representation can be used for finding common semantic parts, face/head tracking, and stereo reconstruction. Due to the strong supervision, our method is robust to pose variations and covers the entire head, including hair. Additionally, the canonical space bottleneck makes sure the obtained representations are consistent across diverse poses and individuals. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results in geometry-aware point matching and monocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models. The code and the model checkpoint will be made available to the public.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Personalization: Towards Fine-Grained Explainability in Natural Language for Personalized Image Generation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image generation models are usually personalized in practical uses in order to better meet the individual users' heterogeneous needs, but most personalized models lack explainability about how they are being personalized. Such explainability can be provided via visual features in generated images, but is difficult for human users to understand. Explainability in natural language is a better choice, but the existing approaches to explainability in natural language are limited to be coarse-grained. They are unable to precisely identify the multiple aspects of personalization, as well as the varying levels of personalization in each aspect. To address such limitation, in this paper we present a new technique, namely \textbf{FineXL}, towards \textbf{Fine}-grained e\textbf{X}plainability in natural \textbf{L}anguage for personalized image generation models. FineXL can provide natural language descriptions about each distinct aspect of personalization, along with quantitative scores indicating the level of each aspect of personalization. Experiment results show that FineXL can improve the accuracy of explainability by 56\%, when different personalization scenarios are applied to multiple types of image generation models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Opto-electronic neural networks integrate optical front-ends with electronic back-ends to enable fast and energy-efficient vision. However, conventional end-to-end optimization of both the optical and electronic modules is limited by costly simulations and large parameter spaces. We introduce a two-stage strategy for designing opto-electronic convolutional neural networks (CNNs): first, train a standard electronic CNN, then realize the optical front-end implemented as a metasurface array through direct kernel optimization of its first convolutional layer. This approach reduces computational and memory demands by hundreds of times and improves training stability compared to end-to-end optimization. On monocular depth estimation, the proposed two-stage design achieves twice the accuracy of end-to-end training under the same training time and resource constraints.</description>

      <title>A Step Toward World Models: A Survey on Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous agents are increasingly expected to operate in complex, dynamic, and uncertain environments, performing tasks such as manipulation, navigation, and decision-making. Achieving these capabilities requires agents to understand the underlying mechanisms and dynamics of the world, moving beyond purely reactive control or simple replication of observed states. This motivates the development of world models as internal representations that encode environmental states, capture dynamics, and enable prediction, planning, and reasoning. Despite growing interest, the definition, scope, architectures, and essential capabilities of world models remain ambiguous. In this survey, rather than directly imposing a fixed definition and limiting our scope to methods explicitly labeled as world models, we examine approaches that exhibit the core capabilities of world models through a review of methods in robotic manipulation. We analyze their roles across perception, prediction, and control, identify key challenges and solutions, and distill the core components, capabilities, and functions that a real world model should possess. Building on this analysis, we aim to outline a roadmap for developing generalizable and practical world models for robotics.</description>

      <title>OmniField: Conditioned Neural Fields for Robust Multimodal Spatiotemporal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal spatiotemporal learning on real-world experimental data is constrained by two challenges: within-modality measurements are sparse, irregular, and noisy (QA/QC artifacts) but cross-modally correlated; the set of available modalities varies across space and time, shrinking the usable record unless models can adapt to arbitrary subsets at train and test time. We propose OmniField, a continuity-aware framework that learns a continuous neural field conditioned on available modalities and iteratively fuses cross-modal context. A multimodal crosstalk block architecture paired with iterative cross-modal refinement aligns signals prior to the decoder, enabling unified reconstruction, interpolation, forecasting, and cross-modal prediction without gridding or surrogate preprocessing. Extensive evaluations show that OmniField consistently outperforms eight strong multimodal spatiotemporal baselines. Under heavy simulated sensor noise, performance remains close to clean-input levels, highlighting robustness to corrupted measurements.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Magnetic Particle Imaging System Matrix Recovery Using a Vision Transformer with Residual Feature Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a hybrid deep learning framework, the Vision Transformer with Residual Feature Network (VRF-Net), for recovering high-resolution system matrices in Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI). MPI resolution often suffers from downsampling and coil sensitivity variations. VRF-Net addresses these challenges by combining transformer-based global attention with residual convolutional refinement, enabling recovery of both large-scale structures and fine details. To reflect realistic MPI conditions, the system matrix is degraded using a dual-stage downsampling strategy. Training employed paired-image super-resolution on the public Open MPI dataset and a simulated dataset incorporating variable coil sensitivity profiles. For system matrix recovery on the Open MPI dataset, VRF-Net achieved nRMSE = 0.403, pSNR = 39.08 dB, and SSIM = 0.835 at 2x scaling, and maintained strong performance even at challenging scale 8x (pSNR = 31.06 dB, SSIM = 0.717). For the simulated dataset, VRF-Net achieved nRMSE = 4.44, pSNR = 28.52 dB, and SSIM = 0.771 at 2x scaling, with stable performance at higher scales. On average, it reduced nRMSE by 88.2%, increased pSNR by 44.7%, and improved SSIM by 34.3% over interpolation and CNN-based methods. In image reconstruction of Open MPI phantoms, VRF-Net further reduced reconstruction error to nRMSE = 1.79 at 2x scaling, while preserving structural fidelity (pSNR = 41.58 dB, SSIM = 0.960), outperforming existing methods. These findings demonstrate that VRF-Net enables sharper, artifact-free system matrix recovery and robust image reconstruction across multiple scales, offering a promising direction for future in vivo applications.</description>

      <title>3D Point Cloud Object Detection on Edge Devices for Split Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of autonomous driving technology is rapidly advancing, with deep learning being a key component. Particularly in the field of sensing, 3D point cloud data collected by LiDAR is utilized to run deep neural network models for 3D object detection. However, these state-of-the-art models are complex, leading to longer processing times and increased power consumption on edge devices. The objective of this study is to address these issues by leveraging Split Computing, a distributed machine learning inference method. Split Computing aims to lessen the computational burden on edge devices, thereby reducing processing time and power consumption. Furthermore, it minimizes the risk of data breaches by only transmitting intermediate data from the deep neural network model. Experimental results show that splitting after voxelization reduces the inference time by 70.8% and the edge device execution time by 90.0%. When splitting within the network, the inference time is reduced by up to 57.1%, and the edge device execution time is reduced by up to 69.5%.</description>

      <title>MammoClean: Toward Reproducible and Bias-Aware AI in Mammography through Dataset Harmonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of clinically reliable artificial intelligence (AI) systems for mammography is hindered by profound heterogeneity in data quality, metadata standards, and population distributions across public datasets. This heterogeneity introduces dataset-specific biases that severely compromise the generalizability of the model, a fundamental barrier to clinical deployment. We present MammoClean, a public framework for standardization and bias quantification in mammography datasets. MammoClean standardizes case selection, image processing (including laterality and intensity correction), and unifies metadata into a consistent multi-view structure. We provide a comprehensive review of breast anatomy, imaging characteristics, and public mammography datasets to systematically identify key sources of bias. Applying MammoClean to three heterogeneous datasets (CBIS-DDSM, TOMPEI-CMMD, VinDr-Mammo), we quantify substantial distributional shifts in breast density and abnormality prevalence. Critically, we demonstrate the direct impact of data corruption: AI models trained on corrupted datasets exhibit significant performance degradation compared to their curated counterparts. By using MammoClean to identify and mitigate bias sources, researchers can construct unified multi-dataset training corpora that enable development of robust models with superior cross-domain generalization. MammoClean provides an essential, reproducible pipeline for bias-aware AI development in mammography, facilitating fairer comparisons and advancing the creation of safe, effective systems that perform equitably across diverse patient populations and clinical settings. The open-source code is publicly available from: https://github.com/Minds-R-Lab/MammoClean.</description>

      <title>A Kullback-Leibler divergence method for input-system-state identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capability of a novel Kullback-Leibler divergence method is examined herein within the Kalman filter framework to select the input-parameter-state estimation execution with the most plausible results. This identification suffers from the uncertainty related to obtaining different results from different initial parameter set guesses, and the examined approach uses the information gained from the data in going from the prior to the posterior distribution to address the issue. Firstly, the Kalman filter is performed for a number of different initial parameter sets providing the system input-parameter-state estimation. Secondly, the resulting posterior distributions are compared simultaneously to the initial prior distributions using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Finally, the identification with the least Kullback-Leibler divergence is selected as the one with the most plausible results. Importantly, the method is shown to select the better performed identification in linear, nonlinear, and limited information applications, providing a powerful tool for system monitoring.</description>

      <title>HAGI++: Head-Assisted Gaze Imputation and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile eye tracking plays a vital role in capturing human visual attention across both real-world and extended reality (XR) environments, making it an essential tool for applications ranging from behavioural research to human-computer interaction. However, missing values due to blinks, pupil detection errors, or illumination changes pose significant challenges for further gaze data analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce HAGI++ - a multi-modal diffusion-based approach for gaze data imputation that, for the first time, uses the integrated head orientation sensors to exploit the inherent correlation between head and eye movements. HAGI++ employs a transformer-based diffusion model to learn cross-modal dependencies between eye and head representations and can be readily extended to incorporate additional body movements. Extensive evaluations on the large-scale Nymeria, Ego-Exo4D, and HOT3D datasets demonstrate that HAGI++ consistently outperforms conventional interpolation methods and deep learning-based time-series imputation baselines in gaze imputation. Furthermore, statistical analyses confirm that HAGI++ produces gaze velocity distributions that closely match actual human gaze behaviour, ensuring more realistic gaze imputations. Moreover, by incorporating wrist motion captured from commercial wearable devices, HAGI++ surpasses prior methods that rely on full-body motion capture in the extreme case of 100% missing gaze data (pure gaze generation). Our method paves the way for more complete and accurate eye gaze recordings in real-world settings and has significant potential for enhancing gaze-based analysis and interaction across various application domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SigmaCollab, a dataset enabling research on physically situated human-AI collaboration. The dataset consists of a set of 85 sessions in which untrained participants were guided by a mixed-reality assistive AI agent in performing procedural tasks in the physical world. SigmaCollab includes a set of rich, multimodal data streams, such as the participant and system audio, egocentric camera views from the head-mounted device, depth maps, head, hand and gaze tracking information, as well as additional annotations performed post-hoc. While the dataset is relatively small in size (~ 14 hours), its application-driven and interactive nature brings to the fore novel research challenges for human-AI collaboration, and provides more realistic testing grounds for various AI models operating in this space. In future work, we plan to use the dataset to construct a set of benchmarks for physically situated collaboration in mixed-reality task assistive scenarios.

      <title>Resource-efficient Automatic Refinement of Segmentations via Weak Supervision from Light Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Delineating anatomical regions is a key task in medical image analysis. Manual segmentation achieves high accuracy but is labor-intensive and prone to variability, thus prompting the development of automated approaches. Recently, a breadth of foundation models has enabled automated segmentations across diverse anatomies and imaging modalities, but these may not always meet the clinical accuracy standards. While segmentation refinement strategies can improve performance, current methods depend on heavy user interactions or require fully supervised segmentations for training. Here, we present SCORE (Segmentation COrrection from Regional Evaluations), a weakly supervised framework that learns to refine mask predictions only using light feedback during training. Specifically, instead of relying on dense training image annotations, SCORE introduces a novel loss that leverages region-wise quality scores and over/under-segmentation error labels. We demonstrate SCORE on humerus CT scans, where it considerably improves initial predictions from TotalSegmentator, and achieves performance on par with existing refinement methods, while greatly reducing their supervision requirements and annotation time. Our code is available at: https://gitlab.inria.fr/adelangl/SCORE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The input-parameter-state estimation capabilities of a novel unscented Kalman filter is examined herein on both linear and nonlinear systems. The unknown input is estimated in two stages within each time step. Firstly, the predicted dynamic states and the system parameters provide an estimation of the input. Secondly, the corrected with measurements states and parameters provide a final estimation. Importantly, it is demonstrated using the perturbation analysis that, a system with at least a zero or a non-zero known input can potentially be uniquely identified. This output-only methodology allows for a better understanding of the system compared to classical output-only parameter identification strategies, given that all the dynamic states, the parameters, and the input are estimated jointly and in real-time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale data has driven breakthroughs in robotics, from language models to vision-language-action models in bimanual manipulation. However, humanoid robotics lacks equally effective data collection frameworks. Existing humanoid teleoperation systems either use decoupled control or depend on expensive motion capture setups. We introduce TWIST2, a portable, mocap-free humanoid teleoperation and data collection system that preserves full whole-body control while advancing scalability. Our system leverages PICO4U VR for obtaining real-time whole-body human motions, with a custom 2-DoF robot neck (cost around $250) for egocentric vision, enabling holistic human-to-humanoid control. We demonstrate long-horizon dexterous and mobile humanoid skills and we can collect 100 demonstrations in 15 minutes with an almost 100% success rate. Building on this pipeline, we propose a hierarchical visuomotor policy framework that autonomously controls the full humanoid body based on egocentric vision. Our visuomotor policy successfully demonstrates whole-body dexterous manipulation and dynamic kicking tasks. The entire system is fully reproducible and open-sourced at https://yanjieze.com/TWIST2 . Our collected dataset is also open-sourced at https://twist-data.github.io .</description>

      <title>Robust Identity Perceptual Watermark Against Deepfake Face Swapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01357v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Notwithstanding offering convenience and entertainment to society, Deepfake face swapping has caused critical privacy issues with the rapid development of deep generative models. Due to imperceptible artifacts in high-quality synthetic images, passive detection models against face swapping in recent years usually suffer performance damping regarding the generalizability issue in cross-domain scenarios. Therefore, several studies have been attempted to proactively protect the original images against malicious manipulations by inserting invisible signals in advance. However, existing proactive defense approaches demonstrate unsatisfactory results with respect to visual quality, detection accuracy, and source tracing ability. In this study, to fulfill the research gap, we propose a robust identity perceptual watermarking framework that concurrently performs detection and source tracing against Deepfake face swapping proactively. We innovatively assign identity semantics regarding the image contents to the watermarks and devise an unpredictable and nonreversible chaotic encryption system to ensure watermark confidentiality. The watermarks are robustly encoded and recovered by jointly training an encoder-decoder framework along with adversarial image manipulations. For a suspect image, falsification is accomplished by justifying the consistency between the content-matched identity perceptual watermark and the recovered robust watermark, without requiring the ground-truth. Moreover, source tracing can be accomplished based on the identity semantics that the recovered watermark carries. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art detection and source tracing performance against Deepfake face swapping with promising watermark robustness for both cross-dataset and cross-manipulation settings.</description>

      <title>Training Convolutional Neural Networks with the Forward-Forward algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14924v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent successes in image analysis with deep neural networks are achieved almost exclusively with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), typically trained using the backpropagation (BP) algorithm. In a 2022 preprint, Geoffrey Hinton proposed the Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm as a biologically inspired alternative, where positive and negative examples are jointly presented to the network and training is guided by a locally defined goodness function. Here, we extend the FF paradigm to CNNs. We introduce two spatially extended labeling strategies, based on Fourier patterns and morphological transformations, that enable convolutional layers to access label information across all spatial positions. On CIFAR10, we show that deeper FF-trained CNNs can be optimized successfully and that morphology-based labels prevent shortcut solutions on dataset with more complex and fine features. On CIFAR100, carefully designed label sets scale effectively to 100 classes. Class Activation Maps reveal that FF-trained CNNs learn meaningful and complementary features across layers. Together, these results demonstrate that FF training is feasible beyond fully connected networks, provide new insights into its learning dynamics and stability, and highlight its potential for neuromorphic computing and biologically inspired learning.</description>

      <title>Deep Fourier-embedded Network for RGB and Thermal Salient Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning has significantly improved salient object detection (SOD) combining both RGB and thermal (RGB-T) images. However, existing Transformer-based RGB-T SOD models with quadratic complexity are memory-intensive, limiting their application in high-resolution bimodal feature fusion. To overcome this limitation, we propose a purely Fourier Transform-based model, namely Deep Fourier-embedded Network (FreqSal), for accurate RGB-T SOD. Specifically, we leverage the efficiency of Fast Fourier Transform with linear complexity to design three key components: (1) To fuse RGB and thermal modalities, we propose Modal-coordinated Perception Attention, which aligns and enhances bimodal Fourier representation in multiple dimensions; (2) To clarify object edges and suppress noise, we design Frequency-decomposed Edge-aware Block, which deeply decomposes and filters Fourier components of low-level features; (3) To accurately decode features, we propose Fourier Residual Channel Attention Block, which prioritizes high-frequency information while aligning channel-wise global relationships. Additionally, even when converged, existing deep learning-based SOD models' predictions still exhibit frequency gaps relative to ground-truth. To address this problem, we propose Co-focus Frequency Loss, which dynamically weights hard frequencies during edge frequency reconstruction by cross-referencing bimodal edge information in the Fourier domain. Extensive experiments on ten bimodal SOD benchmark datasets demonstrate that FreqSal outperforms twenty-nine existing state-of-the-art bimodal SOD models. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the value and effectiveness of our newly proposed components. The code is available at https://github.com/JoshuaLPF/FreqSal.</description>

      <title>Visual Program Distillation with Template-Based Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08564v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adapting visual programming or prompting large language models (LLMs) to generate executable code for visual tasks like visual question answering (VQA) for specialized tasks or domains remains challenging due to high annotation and inference costs. We propose a low-cost visual program distillation method that can be used for models with at most 1 billion parameters and requires no human-generated program annotations. We achieve this through synthetic data augmentation based on decoupling programs into higher-level skills, called templates, and their corresponding arguments. Experimental results show that, with a relatively small amount of question/answer data, small language models can generate high-quality specialized visual programs with the added benefit of much faster inference</description>

      <title>Image Super-Resolution with Guarantees via Conformalized Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing use of generative ML foundation models for image restoration tasks such as super-resolution calls for robust and interpretable uncertainty quantification methods. We address this need by presenting a novel approach based on conformal prediction techniques to create a 'confidence mask' capable of reliably and intuitively communicating where the generated image can be trusted. Our method is adaptable to any black-box generative model, including those locked behind an opaque API, requires only easily attainable data for calibration, and is highly customizable via the choice of a local image similarity metric. We prove strong theoretical guarantees for our method that span fidelity error control (according to our local image similarity metric), reconstruction quality, and robustness in the face of data leakage. Finally, we empirically evaluate these results and establish our method's solid performance.</description>

      <title>Mobile Robotic Multi-View Photometric Stereo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-View Photometric Stereo (MVPS) is a popular method for fine-detailed 3D acquisition of an object from images. Despite its outstanding results on diverse material objects, a typical MVPS experimental setup requires a well-calibrated light source and a monocular camera installed on an immovable base. This restricts the use of MVPS on a movable platform, limiting us from taking MVPS benefits in 3D acquisition for mobile robotics applications. To this end, we introduce a new mobile robotic system for MVPS. While the proposed system brings advantages, it introduces additional algorithmic challenges. Addressing them, in this paper, we further propose an incremental approach for mobile robotic MVPS. Our approach leverages a supervised learning setup to predict per-view surface normal, object depth, and per-pixel uncertainty in model-predicted results. A refined depth map per view is obtained by solving an MVPS-driven optimization problem proposed in this paper. Later, we fuse the refined depth map while tracking the camera pose w.r.t the reference frame to recover globally consistent object 3D geometry. Experimental results show the advantages of our robotic system and algorithm, featuring the local high-frequency surface detail recovery with globally consistent object shape. Our work is beyond any MVPS system yet presented, providing encouraging results on objects with unknown reflectance properties using fewer frames without a tiring calibration and installation process, enabling computationally efficient robotic automation approach to photogrammetry. The proposed approach is nearly 100 times computationally faster than the state-of-the-art MVPS methods such as [1, 2] while maintaining the similar results when tested on subjects taken from the benchmark DiLiGenT MV dataset [3].</description>

      <title>Detection and Geographic Localization of Natural Objects in the Wild: A Case Study on Palms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Palms are ecologically and economically indicators of tropical forest health, biodiversity, and human impact that support local economies and global forest product supply chains. While palm detection in plantations is well-studied, efforts to map naturally occurring palms in dense forests remain limited by overlapping crowns, uneven shading, and heterogeneous landscapes. We develop PRISM (Processing, Inference, Segmentation, and Mapping), a flexible pipeline for detecting and localizing palms in dense tropical forests using large orthomosaic images. Orthomosaics are created from thousands of aerial images and spanning several to hundreds of gigabytes. Our contributions are threefold. First, we construct a large UAV-derived orthomosaic dataset collected across 21 ecologically diverse sites in western Ecuador, annotated with 8,830 bounding boxes and 5,026 palm center points. Second, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art object detectors based on efficiency and performance, integrating zero-shot SAM 2 as the segmentation backbone, and refining the results for precise geographic mapping. Third, we apply calibration methods to align confidence scores with IoU and explore saliency maps for feature explainability. Though optimized for palms, PRISM is adaptable for identifying other natural objects, such as eastern white pines. Future work will explore transfer learning for lower-resolution datasets (0.5 to 1m).</description>

      <title>Rethinking Video Super-Resolution: Towards Diffusion-Based Methods without Motion Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03355v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we rethink the approach to video super-resolution by introducing a method based on the Diffusion Posterior Sampling framework, combined with an unconditional video diffusion transformer operating in latent space. The video generation model, a diffusion transformer, functions as a space-time model. We argue that a powerful model, which learns the physics of the real world, can easily handle various kinds of motion patterns as prior knowledge, thus eliminating the need for explicit estimation of optical flows or motion parameters for pixel alignment. Furthermore, a single instance of the proposed video diffusion transformer model can adapt to different sampling conditions without re-training. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the feasibility of diffusion-based, alignment-free video super-resolution.</description>

      <title>Prompt to Restore, Restore to Prompt: Cyclic Prompting for Universal Adverse Weather Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universal adverse weather removal (UAWR) seeks to address various weather degradations within a unified framework. Recent methods are inspired by prompt learning using pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP), leveraging degradation-aware prompts to facilitate weather-free image restoration, yielding significant improvements. In this work, we propose CyclicPrompt, an innovative cyclic prompt approach designed to enhance the effectiveness, adaptability, and generalizability of UAWR. CyclicPrompt Comprises two key components: 1) a composite context prompt that integrates weather-related information and context-aware representations into the network to guide restoration. This prompt differs from previous methods by marrying learnable input-conditional vectors with weather-specific knowledge, thereby improving adaptability across various degradations. 2) The erase-and-paste mechanism, after the initial guided restoration, substitutes weather-specific knowledge with constrained restoration priors, inducing high-quality weather-free concepts into the composite prompt to further fine-tune the restoration process. Therefore, we can form a cyclic "Prompt-Restore-Prompt" pipeline that adeptly harnesses weather-specific knowledge, textual contexts, and reliable textures. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the superior performance of CyclicPrompt. The code is available at: https://github.com/RongxinL/CyclicPrompt.</description>

      <title>RoMA: Scaling up Mamba-based Foundation Models for Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning for Vision Transformers (ViTs) have fueled breakthroughs in remote sensing (RS) foundation models. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention poses a significant barrier to scalability, particularly for large models and high-resolution images. While the linear-complexity Mamba architecture offers a promising alternative, existing RS applications of Mamba remain limited to supervised tasks on small, domain-specific datasets. To address these challenges, we propose RoMA, a framework that enables scalable self-supervised pretraining of Mamba-based RS foundation models using large-scale, diverse, unlabeled data. RoMA enhances scalability for high-resolution images through a tailored auto-regressive learning strategy, incorporating two key innovations: 1) a rotation-aware pretraining mechanism combining adaptive cropping with angular embeddings to handle sparsely distributed objects with arbitrary orientations, and 2) multi-scale token prediction objectives that address the extreme variations in object scales inherent to RS imagery. Systematic empirical studies validate that Mamba adheres to RS data and parameter scaling laws, with performance scaling reliably as model and data size increase. Furthermore, experiments across scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that RoMA-pretrained Mamba models consistently outperform ViT-based counterparts in both accuracy and computational efficiency. The source code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/MiliLab/RoMA.</description>

      <title>Unseen from Seen: Rewriting Observation-Instruction Using Foundation Models for Augmenting Vision-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data scarcity is a long-standing challenge in the Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) field, which extremely hinders the generalization of agents to unseen environments. Previous works primarily rely on additional simulator data or web-collected images/videos to improve the generalization. However, the simulator environments still face limited diversity, and the web-collected data often requires extensive labor to remove the noise. In this paper, we propose a Rewriting-driven AugMentation (RAM) paradigm for VLN, which directly creates the unseen observation-instruction pairs via rewriting human-annotated training data. Benefiting from our rewriting mechanism, new observation-instruction pairs can be obtained in both simulator-free and labor-saving manners to promote generalization. Specifically, we first introduce Object-Enriched Observation Rewriting, where we combine Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive rewritten object-enriched scene descriptions, enabling observation synthesis with diverse objects and spatial layouts via Text-to-Image Generation Models (T2IMs). Then, we propose Observation-Contrast Instruction Rewriting, which generates observation-aligned rewritten instructions by requiring LLMs to reason the difference between original and new observations. We further develop a mixing-then-focusing training strategy with a random observation cropping scheme, effectively enhancing data distribution diversity while suppressing augmentation data noise during training. Experiments on both the discrete environments (R2R, REVERIE, and R4R datasets) and continuous environments (R2R-CE dataset) show the superior performance and impressive generalization ability of our method.

      <title>The Coralscapes Dataset: Semantic Scene Understanding in Coral Reefs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coral reefs are declining worldwide due to climate change and local stressors. To inform effective conservation or restoration, monitoring at the highest possible spatial and temporal resolution is necessary. Conventional coral reef surveying methods are limited in scalability due to their reliance on expert labor time, motivating the use of computer vision tools to automate the identification and abundance estimation of live corals from images. However, the design and evaluation of such tools has been impeded by the lack of large high quality datasets. We release the Coralscapes dataset, the first general-purpose dense semantic segmentation dataset for coral reefs, covering 2075 images, 39 benthic classes, and 174k segmentation masks annotated by experts. Coralscapes has a similar scope and the same structure as the widely used Cityscapes dataset for urban scene segmentation, allowing benchmarking of semantic segmentation models in a new challenging domain which requires expert knowledge to annotate. We benchmark a wide range of semantic segmentation models, and find that transfer learning from Coralscapes to existing smaller datasets consistently leads to state-of-the-art performance. Coralscapes will catalyze research on efficient, scalable, and standardized coral reef surveying methods based on computer vision, and holds the potential to streamline the development of underwater ecological robotics.</description>

      <title>3DBonsai: Structure-Aware Bonsai Modeling Using Conditioned 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-3D generation have shown remarkable results by leveraging 3D priors in combination with 2D diffusion. However, previous methods utilize 3D priors that lack detailed and complex structural information, limiting them to generating simple objects and presenting challenges for creating intricate structures such as bonsai. In this paper, we propose 3DBonsai, a novel text-to-3D framework for generating 3D bonsai with complex structures. Technically, we first design a trainable 3D space colonization algorithm to produce bonsai structures, which are then enhanced through random sampling and point cloud augmentation to serve as the 3D Gaussian priors. We introduce two bonsai generation pipelines with distinct structural levels: fine structure conditioned generation, which initializes 3D Gaussians using a 3D structure prior to produce detailed and complex bonsai, and coarse structure conditioned generation, which employs a multi-view structure consistency module to align 2D and 3D structures. Moreover, we have compiled a unified 2D and 3D Chinese-style bonsai dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that 3DBonsai significantly outperforms existing methods, providing a new benchmark for structure-aware 3D bonsai generation.</description>

      <title>FractalForensics: Proactive Deepfake Detection and Localization via Fractal Watermarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proactive Deepfake detection via robust watermarks has seen interest ever since passive Deepfake detectors encountered challenges in identifying high-quality synthetic images. However, while demonstrating reasonable detection performance, they lack localization functionality and explainability in detection results. Additionally, the unstable robustness of watermarks can significantly affect the detection performance. In this study, we propose novel fractal watermarks for proactive Deepfake detection and localization, namely FractalForensics. Benefiting from the characteristics of fractals, we devise a parameter-driven watermark generation pipeline that derives fractal-based watermarks and performs one-way encryption of the selected parameters. Subsequently, we propose a semi-fragile watermarking framework for watermark embedding and recovery, trained to be robust against benign image processing operations and fragile when facing Deepfake manipulations in a black-box setting. Moreover, we introduce an entry-to-patch strategy that implicitly embeds the watermark matrix entries into image patches at corresponding positions, achieving localization of Deepfake manipulations. Extensive experiments demonstrate satisfactory robustness and fragility of our approach against common image processing operations and Deepfake manipulations, outperforming state-of-the-art semi-fragile watermarking algorithms and passive detectors for Deepfake detection. Furthermore, by highlighting the areas manipulated, our method provides explainability for the proactive Deepfake detection results.</description>

      <title>Breaking Down Monocular Ambiguity: Exploiting Temporal Evolution for 3D Lane Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monocular 3D lane detection aims to estimate the 3D position of lanes from frontal-view (FV) images. However, existing methods are fundamentally constrained by the inherent ambiguity of single-frame input, which leads to inaccurate geometric predictions and poor lane integrity, especially for distant lanes.To overcome this, we propose to unlock the rich information embedded in the temporal evolution of the scene as the vehicle moves. Our proposed Geometry-aware Temporal Aggregation Network (GTA-Net) systematically leverages the temporal information from complementary perspectives.First, Temporal Geometry Enhancement Module (TGEM) learns geometric consistency across consecutive frames, effectively recovering depth information from motion to build a reliable 3D scene representation.Second, to enhance lane integrity, Temporal Instance-aware Query Generation (TIQG) module aggregates instance cues from past and present frames. Crucially, for lanes that are ambiguous in the current view, TIQG innovatively synthesizes a pseudo future perspective to generate queries that reveal lanes which would otherwise be missed.The experiments demonstrate that GTA-Net achieves new SoTA results, significantly outperforming existing monocular 3D lane detection solutions.</description>

      <title>GeoLLaVA-8K: Scaling Remote-Sensing Multimodal Large Language Models to 8K Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) remote sensing (RS) imagery offers valuable data for Earth observation but pose challenges for existing multimodal foundation models due to two key bottlenecks: (1) limited availability of UHR training data, and (2) token explosion caused by the large image size. To address data scarcity, we introduce SuperRS-VQA (avg. 8,376$\times$8,376) and HighRS-VQA (avg. 2,000$\times$1,912), the highest-resolution vision-language datasets in RS to date, covering 22 real-world dialogue tasks. To mitigate token explosion, our pilot studies reveal significant redundancy in RS images: crucial information is concentrated in a small subset of object-centric tokens, while pruning background tokens (e.g., ocean or forest) can even improve performance. Motivated by these findings, we propose two strategies: Background Token Pruning and Anchored Token Selection, to reduce the memory footprint while preserving key semantics.Integrating these techniques, we introduce GeoLLaVA-8K, the first RS-focused multimodal large language model capable of handling inputs up to 8K$\times$8K resolution, built on the LLaVA framework. Trained on SuperRS-VQA and HighRS-VQA, GeoLLaVA-8K sets a new state-of-the-art on the XLRS-Bench.</description>

      <title>OmniEarth-Bench: Towards Holistic Evaluation of Earth's Six Spheres and Cross-Spheres Interactions with Multimodal Observational Earth Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks for multimodal learning in Earth science offer limited, siloed coverage of Earth's spheres and their cross-sphere interactions, typically restricting evaluation to the human-activity sphere of atmosphere and to at most 16 tasks. These limitations: \textit{narrow-source heterogeneity (single/few data sources), constrained scientific granularity, and limited-sphere extensibility}. Therefore, we introduce \textbf{OmniEarth-Bench}, the first multimodal benchmark that systematically spans all six spheres: atmosphere, lithosphere, oceanosphere, cryosphere, biosphere, and human-activity sphere, and cross-spheres. Built with a scalable, modular-topology data inference framework and native multi-observation sources and expert-in-the-loop curation, OmniEarth-Bench produces 29,855 standardized, expert-curated annotations. All annotations are organized into a four-level hierarchy (Sphere, Scenario, Ability, Task), encompassing 109 expert-curated evaluation tasks. Experiments on 9 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that even the most advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where none of them reach 35\% accuracy, revealing systematic gaps in Earth-system cognitive ability. The dataset and evaluation code were released at OmniEarth-Bench (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/OmniEarth-Bench-B1BD).</description>

      <title>Towards Predicting Any Human Trajectory In Context</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting accurate future trajectories of pedestrians is essential for autonomous systems but remains a challenging task due to the need for adaptability in different environments and domains. A common approach involves collecting scenario-specific data and performing fine-tuning via backpropagation. However, the need to fine-tune for each new scenario is often impractical for deployment on edge devices. To address this challenge, we introduce TrajICL, an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction that enables adaptation without fine-tuning on the scenario-specific data at inference time without requiring weight updates. We propose a spatio-temporal similarity-based example selection (STES) method that selects relevant examples from previously observed trajectories within the same scene by identifying similar motion patterns at corresponding locations. To further refine this selection, we introduce prediction-guided example selection (PG-ES), which selects examples based on both the past trajectory and the predicted future trajectory, rather than relying solely on the past trajectory. This approach allows the model to account for long-term dynamics when selecting examples. Finally, instead of relying on small real-world datasets with limited scenario diversity, we train our model on a large-scale synthetic dataset to enhance its prediction ability by leveraging in-context examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajICL achieves remarkable adaptation across both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, outperforming even fine-tuned approaches across multiple public benchmarks.

      <title>DIsoN: Decentralized Isolation Networks for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safe deployment of machine learning (ML) models in safety-critical domains such as medical imaging requires detecting inputs with characteristics not seen during training, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, to prevent unreliable predictions. Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit from access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test samples and the training data distribution to identify differences. State-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard the training data after deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally stored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings. This is because shipping the training data with the deployed model is usually impossible due to the size of training databases, as well as proprietary or privacy constraints. We introduce the Isolation Network, an OOD detection framework that quantifies the difficulty of separating a target test sample from the training data by solving a binary classification task. We then propose Decentralized Isolation Networks (DIsoN), which enables the comparison of training and test data when data-sharing is impossible, by exchanging only model parameters between the remote computational nodes of training and deployment. We further extend DIsoN with class-conditioning, comparing a target sample solely with training data of its predicted class. We evaluate DIsoN on four medical imaging datasets (dermatology, chest X-ray, breast ultrasound, histopathology) across 12 OOD detection tasks. DIsoN performs favorably against existing methods while respecting data-privacy. This decentralized OOD detection framework opens the way for a new type of service that ML developers could provide along with their models: providing remote, secure utilization of their training data for OOD detection services.

      <title>GeoSDF: Plane Geometry Diagram Synthesis via Signed Distance Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plane Geometry Diagram Synthesis has been a crucial task in computer graphics, with applications ranging from educational tools to AI-driven mathematical reasoning. Traditionally, we rely on manual tools (e.g., Matplotlib and GeoGebra) to generate precise diagrams, but this usually requires huge, complicated calculations. Recently, researchers start to work on model-based methods (e.g., Stable Diffusion and GPT5) to automatically generate diagrams, saving operational cost but usually suffering from limited realism and insufficient accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel framework GeoSDF, to automatically generate diagrams efficiently and accurately with Signed Distance Field (SDF). Specifically, we first represent geometric elements (e.g., points, segments, and circles) in the SDF, then construct a series of constraint functions to represent geometric relationships. Next, we optimize those constructed constraint functions to get an optimized field of both elements and constraints. Finally, by rendering the optimized field, we can obtain the synthesized diagram. In our GeoSDF, we define a symbolic language to represent geometric elements and constraints, and our synthesized geometry diagrams can be self-verified in the SDF, ensuring both mathematical accuracy and visual plausibility. In experiments, through both qualitative and quantitative analysis, GeoSDF synthesized both normal high-school level and IMO-level geometry diagrams. We achieve 88.67\% synthesis accuracy by human evaluation in the IMO problem set. Furthermore, we obtain a very high accuracy of solving geometry problems (over 95\% while the current SOTA accuracy is around 75%) by leveraging our self-verification property. All of these demonstrate the advantage of GeoSDF, paving the way for more sophisticated, accurate, and flexible generation of geometric diagrams for a wide array of applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning-assisted diagnosis shows promise, yet medical imaging datasets are often scarce, imbalanced, and constrained by privacy, making data augmentation essential. Classical generative models typically demand extensive computational and sample resources. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods remain limited in scale and often face barren plateaus. We present MediQ-GAN, a quantum-inspired GAN with prototype-guided skip connections and a dual-stream generator that fuses classical and quantum-inspired branches. Its variational quantum circuits inherently preserve full-rank mappings, avoid rank collapse, and are theory-guided to balance expressivity with trainability. Beyond generation quality, we provide the first latent-geometry and rank-based analysis of quantum-inspired GANs, offering theoretical insight into their performance. Across three medical imaging datasets, MediQ-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art GANs and diffusion models. While validated on IBM hardware for robustness, our contribution is hardware-agnostic, offering a scalable and data-efficient framework for medical image generation and augmentation.</description>

      <title>Weakly Supervised Object Segmentation by Background Conditional Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a computer vision task, automatic object segmentation remains challenging in specialized image domains without massive labeled data, such as synthetic aperture sonar images, remote sensing, biomedical imaging, etc. In any domain, obtaining pixel-wise segmentation masks is expensive. In this work, we propose a method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation using weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an object of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more quickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the segmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create realistic images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a contrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose to first cluster the background-only images and then, during learning, create counterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source backgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the training loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the real object images with backgrounds of the target cluster. The other term is a supervised loss for background-only images. While an adversarial critic could provide the divergence, we use sample-based divergences. We conduct experiments on side-scan and synthetic aperture sonar in which our approach succeeds compared to previous unsupervised segmentation baselines that were only tested on natural images. Furthermore, to show generality we extend our experiments to natural images, obtaining reasonable performance with our method that avoids pretrained networks, generative networks, and adversarial critics.

      <title>Crucial-Diff: A Unified Diffusion Model for Crucial Image and Annotation Synthesis in Data-scarce Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scarcity of data in various scenarios, such as medical, industry and autonomous driving, leads to model overfitting and dataset imbalance, thus hindering effective detection and segmentation performance. Existing studies employ the generative models to synthesize more training samples to mitigate data scarcity. However, these synthetic samples are repetitive or simplistic and fail to provide "crucial information" that targets the downstream model's weaknesses. Additionally, these methods typically require separate training for different objects, leading to computational inefficiencies. To address these issues, we propose Crucial-Diff, a domain-agnostic framework designed to synthesize crucial samples. Our method integrates two key modules. The Scene Agnostic Feature Extractor (SAFE) utilizes a unified feature extractor to capture target information. The Weakness Aware Sample Miner (WASM) generates hard-to-detect samples using feedback from the detection results of downstream model, which is then fused with the output of SAFE module. Together, our Crucial-Diff framework generates diverse, high-quality training data, achieving a pixel-level AP of 83.63% and an F1-MAX of 78.12% on MVTec. On polyp dataset, Crucial-Diff reaches an mIoU of 81.64% and an mDice of 87.69%. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/JJessicaYao/Crucial-diff.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14501v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D reconstruction and view synthesis are foundational problems in computer vision, graphics, and immersive technologies such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and digital twins. Traditional methods rely on computationally intensive iterative optimization in a complex chain, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent advances in feed-forward approaches, driven by deep learning, have revolutionized this field by enabling fast and generalizable 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. This survey offers a comprehensive review of feed-forward techniques for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, with a taxonomy according to the underlying representation architectures including point cloud, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), etc. We examine key tasks such as pose-free reconstruction, dynamic 3D reconstruction, and 3D-aware image and video synthesis, highlighting their applications in digital humans, SLAM, robotics, and beyond. In addition, we review commonly used datasets with detailed statistics, along with evaluation protocols for various downstream tasks. We conclude by discussing open research challenges and promising directions for future work, emphasizing the potential of feed-forward approaches to advance the state of the art in 3D vision.</description>

      <title>Light Future: Multimodal Action Frame Prediction via InstructPix2Pix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting future motion trajectories is a critical capability across domains such as robotics, autonomous systems, and human activity forecasting, enabling safer and more intelligent decision-making. This paper proposes a novel, efficient, and lightweight approach for robot action prediction, offering significantly reduced computational cost and inference latency compared to conventional video prediction models. Importantly, it pioneers the adaptation of the InstructPix2Pix model for forecasting future visual frames in robotic tasks, extending its utility beyond static image editing. We implement a deep learning-based visual prediction framework that forecasts what a robot will observe 100 frames (10 seconds) into the future, given a current image and a textual instruction. We repurpose and fine-tune the InstructPix2Pix model to accept both visual and textual inputs, enabling multimodal future frame prediction. Experiments on the RoboTWin dataset (generated based on real-world scenarios) demonstrate that our method achieves superior SSIM and PSNR compared to state-of-the-art baselines in robot action prediction tasks. Unlike conventional video prediction models that require multiple input frames, heavy computation, and slow inference latency, our approach only needs a single image and a text prompt as input. This lightweight design enables faster inference, reduced GPU demands, and flexible multimodal control, particularly valuable for applications like robotics and sports motion trajectory analytics, where motion trajectory precision is prioritized over visual fidelity.</description>

      <title>A Practical Investigation of Spatially-Controlled Image Generation with Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enabling image generation models to be spatially controlled is an important area of research, empowering users to better generate images according to their own fine-grained specifications via e.g. edge maps, poses. Although this task has seen impressive improvements in recent times, a focus on rapidly producing stronger models has come at the cost of detailed and fair scientific comparison. Differing training data, model architectures and generation paradigms make it difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to performance. Meanwhile, the motivations and nuances of certain approaches become lost in the literature. In this work, we aim to provide clear takeaways across generation paradigms for practitioners wishing to develop transformer-based systems for spatially-controlled generation, clarifying the literature and addressing knowledge gaps. We perform controlled experiments on ImageNet across diffusion-based/flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models. First, we establish control token prefilling as a simple, general and performant baseline approach for transformers. We then investigate previously underexplored sampling time enhancements, showing that extending classifier-free guidance to control, as well as softmax truncation, have a strong impact on control-generation consistency. Finally, we re-clarify the motivation of adapter-based approaches, demonstrating that they mitigate "forgetting" and maintain generation quality when trained on limited downstream data, but underperform full training in terms of generation-control consistency.</description>

      <title>Label tree semantic losses for rich multi-class medical image segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rich and accurate medical image segmentation is poised to underpin the next generation of AI-defined clinical practice by delineating critical anatomy for pre-operative planning, guiding real-time intra-operative navigation, and supporting precise post-operative assessment. However, commonly used learning methods for medical and surgical imaging segmentation tasks penalise all errors equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the labels space. This becomes particularly problematic as the cardinality and richness of labels increases to include subtly different classes. In this work, we propose two tree-based semantic loss functions which take advantage of a hierarchical organisation of the labels. We further incorporate our losses in a recently proposed approach for training with sparse, background-free annotations to extend the applicability of our proposed losses. Extensive experiments are reported on two medical and surgical image segmentation tasks, namely head MRI for whole brain parcellation (WBP) with full supervision and neurosurgical hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for scene understanding with sparse annotations. Results demonstrate that our proposed method reaches state-of-the-art performance in both cases.</description>

      <title>Talk2Event: Grounded Understanding of Dynamic Scenes from Event Cameras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event cameras offer microsecond-level latency and robustness to motion blur, making them ideal for understanding dynamic environments. Yet, connecting these asynchronous streams to human language remains an open challenge. We introduce Talk2Event, the first large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding in event-based perception. Built from real-world driving data, we provide over 30,000 validated referring expressions, each enriched with four grounding attributes -- appearance, status, relation to viewer, and relation to other objects -- bridging spatial, temporal, and relational reasoning. To fully exploit these cues, we propose EventRefer, an attribute-aware grounding framework that dynamically fuses multi-attribute representations through a Mixture of Event-Attribute Experts (MoEE). Our method adapts to different modalities and scene dynamics, achieving consistent gains over state-of-the-art baselines in event-only, frame-only, and event-frame fusion settings. We hope our dataset and approach will establish a foundation for advancing multimodal, temporally-aware, and language-driven perception in real-world robotics and autonomy.</description>

      <title>WXSOD: A Benchmark for Robust Salient Object Detection in Adverse Weather Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in complex environments remains a challenging research topic. Most existing methods perform well in natural scenes with negligible noise, and tend to leverage multi-modal information (e.g., depth and infrared) to enhance accuracy. However, few studies are concerned with the damage of weather noise on SOD performance due to the lack of dataset with pixel-wise annotations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel Weather-eXtended Salient Object Detection (WXSOD) dataset. It consists of 14,945 RGB images with diverse weather noise, along with the corresponding ground truth annotations and weather labels. To verify algorithm generalization, WXSOD contains two test sets, i.e., a synthesized test set and a real test set. The former is generated by adding weather noise to clean images, while the latter contains real-world weather noise. Based on WXSOD, we propose an efficient baseline, termed Weather-aware Feature Aggregation Network (WFANet), which adopts a fully supervised two-branch architecture. Specifically, the weather prediction branch mines weather-related deep features, while the saliency detection branch fuses semantic features extracted from the backbone with weather features for SOD. Comprehensive comparisons against 17 SOD methods shows that our WFANet achieves superior performance on WXSOD. The code and benchmark results will be made publicly available at https://github.com/C-water/WXSOD</description>

      <title>CWSSNet: Hyperspectral Image Classification Enhanced by Wavelet Domain Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However, although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics. To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as the research area to perform ground object classification research. A classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%, and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies, vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level, indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample training conditions.</description>

      <title>3DViT-GAT: A Unified Atlas-Based 3D Vision Transformer and Graph Learning Framework for Major Depressive Disorder Detection Using Structural MRI Data</title>

Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent mental health condition that negatively impacts both individual well-being and global public health. Automated detection of MDD using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and deep learning (DL) methods holds increasing promise for improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early intervention. Most existing methods employ either voxel-level features or handcrafted regional representations built from predefined brain atlases, limiting their ability to capture complex brain patterns. This paper develops a unified pipeline that utilizes Vision Transformers (ViTs) for extracting 3D region embeddings from sMRI data and Graph Neural Network (GNN) for classification. We explore two strategies for defining regions: (1) an atlas-based approach using predefined structural and functional brain atlases, and (2) an cube-based method by which ViTs are trained directly to identify regions from uniformly extracted 3D patches. Further, cosine similarity graphs are generated to model interregional relationships, and guide GNN-based classification. Extensive experiments were conducted using the REST-meta-MDD dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. With stratified 10-fold cross-validation, the best model obtained 81.51\% accuracy, 85.94\% sensitivity, 76.36\% specificity, 80.88\% precision, and 83.33\% F1-score. Further, atlas-based models consistently outperformed the cube-based approach, highlighting the importance of using domain-specific anatomical priors for MDD detection.</description>

      <title>Research on Expressway Congestion Warning Technology Based on YOLOv11-DIoU and GRU-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expressway traffic congestion severely reduces travel efficiency and hinders regional connectivity. Existing "detection-prediction" systems have critical flaws: low vehicle perception accuracy under occlusion and loss of long-sequence dependencies in congestion forecasting. This study proposes an integrated technical framework to resolve these issues.For traffic flow perception, two baseline algorithms were optimized. Traditional YOLOv11 was upgraded to YOLOv11-DIoU by replacing GIoU Loss with DIoU Loss, and DeepSort was improved by fusing Mahalanobis (motion) and cosine (appearance) distances. Experiments on Chang-Shen Expressway videos showed YOLOv11-DIoU achieved 95.7\% mAP (6.5 percentage points higher than baseline) with 5.3\% occlusion miss rate. DeepSort reached 93.8\% MOTA (11.3 percentage points higher than SORT) with only 4 ID switches. Using the Greenberg model (for 10-15 vehicles/km high-density scenarios), speed and density showed a strong negative correlation (r=-0.97), conforming to traffic flow theory. For congestion warning, a GRU-Attention model was built to capture congestion precursors. Trained 300 epochs with flow, density, and speed, it achieved 99.7\% test accuracy (7-9 percentage points higher than traditional GRU). In 10-minute advance warnings for 30-minute congestion, time error was $\leq$ 1 minute. Validation with an independent video showed 95\% warning accuracy, over 90\% spatial overlap of congestion points, and stable performance in high-flow ($&gt;$5 vehicles/second) scenarios.This framework provides quantitative support for expressway congestion control, with promising intelligent transportation applications.</description>

      <title>FitPro: A Zero-Shot Framework for Interactive Text-based Pedestrian Retrieval in Open World</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-based Pedestrian Retrieval (TPR) deals with retrieving specific target pedestrians in visual scenes according to natural language descriptions. Although existing methods have achieved progress under constrained settings, interactive retrieval in the open-world scenario still suffers from limited model generalization and insufficient semantic understanding. To address these challenges, we propose FitPro, an open-world interactive zero-shot TPR framework with enhanced semantic comprehension and cross-scene adaptability. FitPro has three innovative components: Feature Contrastive Decoding (FCD), Incremental Semantic Mining (ISM), and Query-aware Hierarchical Retrieval (QHR). The FCD integrates prompt-guided contrastive decoding to generate high-quality structured pedestrian descriptions from denoised images, effectively alleviating semantic drift in zero-shot scenarios. The ISM constructs holistic pedestrian representations from multi-view observations to achieve global semantic modeling in multi-turn interactions, thereby improving robustness against viewpoint shifts and fine-grained variations in descriptions. The QHR dynamically optimizes the retrieval pipeline according to query types, enabling efficient adaptation to multi-modal and multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments on five public datasets and two evaluation protocols demonstrate that FitPro significantly overcomes the generalization limitations and semantic modeling constraints of existing methods in interactive retrieval, paving the way for practical deployment.</description>

      <title>InternSVG: Towards Unified SVG Tasks with Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited transferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling structural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance. Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary counterparts.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Neural Video Compression with Unified Intra and Inter Coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14431v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent years, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior compression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding capabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations, including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled, disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding, where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an average of 12.1% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and models will be released.</description>

      <title>WeCKD: Weakly-supervised Chained Distillation Network for Efficient Multimodal Medical Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has traditionally relied on a static teacher-student framework, where a large, well-trained teacher transfers knowledge to a single student model. However, these approaches often suffer from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and reliance on either a very strong teacher model or large labeled datasets. To address these, we present the first-ever Weakly-supervised Chain-based KD network (WeCKD) that redefines knowledge transfer through a structured sequence of interconnected models. Unlike conventional KD, it forms a progressive distillation chain, where each model not only learns from its predecessor but also refines the knowledge before passing it forward. This structured knowledge transfer further enhances feature learning and addresses the limitations of one-step KD. Each model in the chain is trained on only a fraction of the dataset and shows that effective learning can be achieved with minimal supervision. Extensive evaluation on six imaging datasets across otoscopic, microscopic, and magnetic resonance imaging modalities shows that it generalizes and outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, the proposed distillation chain resulted in cumulative accuracy gains of up to +23% over a single backbone trained on the same limited data, which highlights its potential for real-world adoption.</description>

      <title>CrossRay3D: Geometry and Distribution Guidance for Efficient Multimodal 3D Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15991v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sparse cross-modality detector offers more advantages than its counterpart, the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) detector, particularly in terms of adaptability for downstream tasks and computational cost savings. However, existing sparse detectors overlook the quality of token representation, leaving it with a sub-optimal foreground quality and limited performance. In this paper, we identify that the geometric structure preserved and the class distribution are the key to improving the performance of the sparse detector, and propose a Sparse Selector (SS). The core module of SS is Ray-Aware Supervision (RAS), which preserves rich geometric information during the training stage, and Class-Balanced Supervision, which adaptively reweights the salience of class semantics, ensuring that tokens associated with small objects are retained during token sampling. Thereby, outperforming other sparse multi-modal detectors in the representation of tokens. Additionally, we design Ray Positional Encoding (Ray PE) to address the distribution differences between the LiDAR modality and the image. Finally, we integrate the aforementioned module into an end-to-end sparse multi-modality detector, dubbed CrossRay3D. Experiments show that, on the challenging nuScenes benchmark, CrossRay3D achieves state-of-the-art performance with 72.4 mAP and 74.7 NDS, while running 1.84 faster than other leading methods. Moreover, CrossRay3D demonstrates strong robustness even in scenarios where LiDAR or camera data are partially or entirely missing.</description>

      <title>Uniworld-V2: Reinforce Image Editing with Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning and MLLM Implicit Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable progress; however, models solely trained via supervised fine-tuning often overfit to annotated patterns, hindering their ability to explore and generalize beyond training distributions. To this end, we introduce Edit-R1, a novel post-training framework for instruction-based image editing based on policy optimization. Specifically, we utilize Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning (DiffusionNFT), a likelihood-free policy optimization method consistent with the flow matching forward process, thereby enabling the use of higher-order samplers and more efficient training. Another key challenge here is the absence of a universal reward model, resulting from the diverse nature of editing instructions and tasks. To bridge this gap, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a unified, training-free reward model, leveraging its output logits to provide fine-grained feedback. Furthermore, we carefully design a low-variance group filtering mechanism to reduce MLLM scoring noise and stabilize optimization. \texttt{UniWorld-V2}, trained with this framework, achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art} results on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks, scoring 4.49 and 7.83, respectively. Crucially, our framework is model-agnostic, delivering substantial performance gains when applied to diverse base models like Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, demonstrating its wide applicability. Code and models are publicly available to support further research.</description>

      <title>Progressive Growing of Patch Size: Curriculum Learning for Accelerated and Improved Medical Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch Size, an automatic curriculum learning approach for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach progressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an improved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of the training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a resource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score performance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical image segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score performance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a notable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves upon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically significant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably, across all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the constant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously reducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced for highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks. Rigorous experiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean segmentation performance but also reduces performance variance, yielding more trustworthy model comparison. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the proposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but represents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance across diverse segmentation models, including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR. In summary, we show that this simple yet elegant transformation on input data substantially improves both Dice Score performance and training runtime, while being compatible across diverse segmentation backbones.</description>

      <title>A Quantitative Evaluation Framework for Explainable AI in Semantic Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in artificial intelligence (AI) models is essential as they are increasingly deployed in safety-critical and high-stakes domains. Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge; however, the rigorous evaluation of XAI methods remains vital for balancing the trade-offs between model complexity, predictive performance, and interpretability. While substantial progress has been made in evaluating XAI for classification tasks, strategies tailored to semantic segmentation remain limited. Moreover, objectively assessing XAI approaches is difficult, since qualitative visual explanations provide only preliminary insights. Such qualitative methods are inherently subjective and cannot ensure the accuracy or stability of explanations. To address these limitations, this work introduces a comprehensive quantitative evaluation framework for assessing XAI in semantic segmentation, accounting for both spatial and contextual task complexities. The framework systematically integrates pixel-level evaluation strategies with carefully designed metrics to yield fine-grained interpretability insights. Simulation results using recently adapted class activation mapping (CAM)-based XAI schemes demonstrate the efficiency, robustness, and reliability of the proposed methodology. These findings advance the development of transparent, trustworthy, and accountable semantic segmentation models.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive pretraining and instruction tuning, have greatly pushed the frontier of multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR, and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches in both quality and versatility.

      <title>Dual-level Progressive Hardness-Aware Reweighting for Cross-View Geo-Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27181v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) between drone and satellite imagery remains challenging due to severe viewpoint gaps and the presence of hard negatives, which are visually similar but geographically mismatched samples. Existing mining or reweighting strategies often use static weighting, which is sensitive to distribution shifts and prone to overemphasizing difficult samples too early, leading to noisy gradients and unstable convergence. In this paper, we present a Dual-level Progressive Hardness-aware Reweighting (DPHR) strategy. At the sample level, a Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware (RDA) module evaluates relative difficulty and assigns fine-grained weights to negatives. At the batch level, a Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting (PALW) mechanism exploits a training-progress signal to attenuate noisy gradients during early optimization and progressively enhance hard-negative mining as training matures. Experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed DPHR, achieving consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly integrated into human lives, endowing them with robust social intelligence has emerged as a critical frontier. A key aspect of this intelligence is discerning truth from deception, a ubiquitous element of human interaction that is conveyed through a complex interplay of verbal language and non-verbal visual cues. However, automatic deception detection in dynamic, multi-party conversations remains a significant challenge. The recent rise of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), with their impressive abilities in visual and textual understanding, makes them natural candidates for this task. Consequently, their capabilities in this crucial domain are mostly unquantified. To address this gap, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and present a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game Werewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly conservative in their alignment, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Prompt for Incremental Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating trainable prompts into pretrained models enables effective incremental learning. However, the application of prompts in incremental object detection (IOD) remains underexplored. Existing prompts pool based approaches assume disjoint class sets across incremental tasks, which are unsuitable for IOD as they overlook the inherent co-occurrence phenomenon in detection images. In co-occurring scenarios, unlabeled objects from previous tasks may appear in current task images, leading to confusion in prompts pool. In this paper, we hold that prompt structures should exhibit adaptive consolidation properties across tasks, with constrained updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Motivated by this, we introduce Parameterized Prompts for Incremental Object Detection (P$^2$IOD). Leveraging neural networks global evolution properties, P$^2$IOD employs networks as the parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate knowledge across tasks. To constrain prompts structure updates, P$^2$IOD further engages a parameterized prompts fusion strategy. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that P$^2$IOD's effectiveness in IOD and achieves the state-of-the-art performance among existing baselines.</description>

      <title>ThinkMorph: Emergent Properties in Multimodal Interleaved Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal reasoning requires iterative coordination between language and vision, yet it remains unclear what constitutes a meaningful interleaved chain of thought. We posit that text and image thoughts should function as complementary rather than isomorphic modalities that mutually advance reasoning. Guided by this principle, we build ThinkMorph, a unified model fine-tuned on approximately 24K high-quality interleaved reasoning traces spanning tasks with varying visual engagement. ThinkMorph learns to generate progressive text-image reasoning steps that concretely manipulate visual content while maintaining coherent verbal logic. It delivers large gains on vision-centric benchmarks (averaging 34.7 percent over the base model) and generalizes to out-of-domain tasks, matching or surpassing larger and proprietary VLMs. Beyond performance, ThinkMorph exhibits emergent multimodal intelligence, including unseen visual manipulation skills, adaptive switching between reasoning modes, and better test-time scaling through diversified multimodal thoughts. These findings suggest promising directions for characterizing the emergent capabilities of unified models for multimodal reasoning.</description>

      <title>Dual-Stream Diffusion for World-Model Augmented Vision-Language-Action Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, augmenting vision-language-action models (VLAs) with world-models has shown promise in robotic policy learning. However, it remains challenging to jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences because of the inherent difference between the two modalities. To address this, we propose DUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework that handles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across diverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer architecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while enabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we propose training techniques such as independent noise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow matching loss, which enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional manner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Furthermore, based on the decoupled training framework, we introduce a sampling method where we sample action and vision tokens asynchronously at different rates, which shows improvement through inference-time scaling. Through experiments on simulated benchmarks such as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up to 6% gains over a standard VLA baseline and implicit world-modeling methods, with our inference-time scaling approach providing an additional 2-5% gain on success rate. On real-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST outperforms baselines in success rate by 13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond simulation. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DUST in large-scale pretraining with action-free videos from BridgeV2, where DUST leads to significant gain when transferred to the RoboCasa benchmark.</description>

      <title>ID-Composer: Multi-Subject Video Synthesis with Hierarchical Identity Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video generative models pretrained on large-scale datasets can produce high-quality videos, but are often conditioned on text or a single image, limiting controllability and applicability. We introduce ID-Composer, a novel framework that addresses this gap by tackling multi-subject video generation from a text prompt and reference images. This task is challenging as it requires preserving subject identities, integrating semantics across subjects and modalities, and maintaining temporal consistency. To faithfully preserve the subject consistency and textual information in synthesized videos, ID-Composer designs a hierarchical identity-preserving attention mechanism, which effectively aggregates features within and across subjects and modalities. To effectively allow for the semantic following of user intention, we introduce semantic understanding via pretrained vision-language model (VLM), leveraging VLM's superior semantic understanding to provide fine-grained guidance and capture complex interactions between multiple subjects. Considering that standard diffusion loss often fails in aligning the critical concepts like subject ID, we employ an online reinforcement learning phase to drive the overall training objective of ID-Composer into RLVR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model surpasses existing methods in identity preservation, temporal consistency, and video quality.</description>

      <title>Towards classification-based representation learning for place recognition on LiDAR scans</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Place recognition is a crucial task in autonomous driving, allowing vehicles to determine their position using sensor data. While most existing methods rely on contrastive learning, we explore an alternative approach by framing place recognition as a multi-class classification problem. Our method assigns discrete location labels to LiDAR scans and trains an encoder-decoder model to classify each scan's position directly. We evaluate this approach on the NuScenes dataset and show that it achieves competitive performance compared to contrastive learning-based methods while offering advantages in training efficiency and stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose CatEquiv, a category-equivariant neural network for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) from inertial sensors that systematically encodes temporal, amplitude, and structural symmetries. We introduce a symmetry category that jointly represents cyclic time shifts, positive gain scalings, and the sensor-hierarchy poset, capturing the categorical symmetry structure of the data. CatEquiv achieves equivariance with respect to the categorical symmetry product. On UCI-HAR under out-of-distribution perturbations, CatEquiv attains markedly higher robustness compared with circularly padded CNNs and plain CNNs. These results demonstrate that enforcing categorical symmetries yields strong invariance and generalization without additional model capacity.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Transformer meets Multi-level Wavelet Spectrum for Single Image Super-Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) has been widely explored to enhance the performance of image superresolution (SR). Despite some DWT-based methods improving SR by capturing fine-grained frequency signals, most existing approaches neglect the interrelations among multiscale frequency sub-bands, resulting in inconsistencies and unnatural artifacts in the reconstructed images. To address this challenge, we propose a Diffusion Transformer model based on image Wavelet spectra for SR (DTWSR). DTWSR incorporates the superiority of diffusion models and transformers to capture the interrelations among multiscale frequency sub-bands, leading to a more consistence and realistic SR image. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform to decompose images into wavelet spectra. A pyramid tokenization method is proposed which embeds the spectra into a sequence of tokens for transformer model, facilitating to capture features from both spatial and frequency domain. A dual-decoder is designed elaborately to handle the distinct variances in low-frequency and high-frequency sub-bands, without omitting their alignment in image generation. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, with high performance on both perception quality and fidelity.</description>

      <title>Positive Semi-definite Latent Factor Grouping-Boosted Cluster-reasoning Instance Disentangled Learning for WSI Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has been widely used for representing whole-slide pathology images. However, spatial, semantic, and decision entanglements among instances limit its representation and interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a latent factor grouping-boosted cluster-reasoning instance disentangled learning framework for whole-slide image (WSI) interpretable representation in three phases. First, we introduce a novel positive semi-definite latent factor grouping that maps instances into a latent subspace, effectively mitigating spatial entanglement in MIL. To alleviate semantic entanglement, we employs instance probability counterfactual inference and optimization via cluster-reasoning instance disentangling. Finally, we employ a generalized linear weighted decision via instance effect re-weighting to address decision entanglement. Extensive experiments on multicentre datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms all state-of-the-art models. Moreover, it attains pathologist-aligned interpretability through disentangled representations and a transparent decision-making process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pneumonia remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating accurate and efficient automated detection systems. While recent transformer-based detectors like RT-DETR have shown promise in object detection tasks, their application to medical imaging, particularly pneumonia detection in chest X-rays, remains underexplored. This paper presents CGF-DETR, an enhanced real-time detection transformer specifically designed for pneumonia detection. We introduce XFABlock in the backbone to improve multi-scale feature extraction through convolutional attention mechanisms integrated with CSP architecture. To achieve efficient feature aggregation, we propose SPGA module that replaces standard multi-head attention with dynamic gating mechanisms and single-head self-attention. Additionally, GCFC3 is designed for the neck to enhance feature representation through multi-path convolution fusion while maintaining real-time performance via structural re-parameterization. Extensive experiments on the RSNA Pneumonia Detection dataset demonstrate that CGF-DETR achieves 82.2% mAP@0.5, outperforming the baseline RT-DETR-l by 3.7% while maintaining comparable inference speed at 48.1 FPS. Our ablation studies confirm that each proposed module contributes meaningfully to the overall performance improvement, with the complete model achieving 50.4% mAP@[0.5:0.95]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent advancement of spatial transcriptomics (ST) allows to characterize spatial gene expression within tissue for discovery research. However, current ST platforms suffer from low resolution, hindering in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, current super-resolution methods are limited by restoration uncertainty and mode collapse. Although diffusion models have shown promise in capturing complex interactions between multi-modal conditions, it remains a challenge to integrate histology images and gene expression for super-resolved ST maps. This paper proposes a cross-modal conditional diffusion model for super-resolving ST maps with the guidance of histology images. Specifically, we design a multi-modal disentangling network with cross-modal adaptive modulation to utilize complementary information from histology images and spatial gene expression. Moreover, we propose a dynamic cross-attention modelling strategy to extract hierarchical cell-to-tissue information from histology images. Lastly, we propose a co-expression-based gene-correlation graph network to model the co-expression relationship of multiple genes. Experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in ST super-resolution on three public datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning is a renowned technique for utilizing decentralized data while preserving privacy. However, real-world applications often face challenges like partially labeled datasets, where only a few locations have certain expert annotations, leaving large portions of unlabeled data unused. Leveraging these could enhance transformer architectures ability in regimes with small and diversely annotated sets. We conduct the largest federated cardiac CT analysis to date (n=8,104) in a real-world setting across eight hospitals. Our two-step semi-supervised strategy distills knowledge from task-specific CNNs into a transformer. First, CNNs predict on unlabeled data per label type and then the transformer learns from these predictions with label-specific heads. This improves predictive accuracy and enables simultaneous learning of all partial labels across the federation, and outperforms UNet-based models in generalizability on downstream tasks. Code and model weights are made openly available for leveraging future cardiac CT analysis.</description>

      <title>Joint Lossless Compression and Steganography for Medical Images via Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have driven promising progress in lossless image compression. However, directly adopting existing paradigms for medical images suffers from an unsatisfactory trade-off between compression performance and efficiency. Moreover, existing LLM-based compressors often overlook the security of the compression process, which is critical in modern medical scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel joint lossless compression and steganography framework. Inspired by bit plane slicing (BPS), we find it feasible to securely embed privacy messages into medical images in an invisible manner. Based on this insight, an adaptive modalities decomposition strategy is first devised to partition the entire image into two segments, providing global and local modalities for subsequent dual-path lossless compression. During this dual-path stage, we innovatively propose a segmented message steganography algorithm within the local modality path to ensure the security of the compression process. Coupled with the proposed anatomical priors-based low-rank adaptation (A-LoRA) fine-tuning strategy, extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in terms of compression ratios, efficiency, and security. The source code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Genie Envisioner (GE), a unified world foundation platform for robotic manipulation that integrates policy learning, evaluation, and simulation within a single video-generative framework. At its core, GE-Base is a large-scale, instruction-conditioned video diffusion model that captures the spatial, temporal, and semantic dynamics of real-world robotic interactions in a structured latent space. Built upon this foundation, GE-Act maps latent representations to executable action trajectories through a lightweight, flow-matching decoder, enabling precise and generalizable policy inference across diverse embodiments with minimal supervision. To support scalable evaluation and training, GE-Sim serves as an action-conditioned neural simulator, producing high-fidelity rollouts for closed-loop policy development. The platform is further equipped with EWMBench, a standardized benchmark suite measuring visual fidelity, physical consistency, and instruction-action alignment. Together, these components establish Genie Envisioner as a scalable and practical foundation for instruction-driven, general-purpose embodied intelligence. All code, models, and benchmarks will be released publicly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ice-containing clouds strongly impact climate, but they are hard to model due to ice crystal habit (i.e., shape) diversity. We use self-supervised learning (SSL) to learn latent representations of crystals from ice crystal imagery. By pre-training a vision transformer with many cloud particle images, we learn robust representations of crystal morphology, which can be used for various science-driven tasks. Our key contributions include (1) validating that our SSL approach can be used to learn meaningful representations, and (2) presenting a relevant application where we quantify ice crystal diversity with these latent representations. Our results demonstrate the power of SSL-driven representations to improve the characterization of ice crystals and subsequently constrain their role in Earth's climate system.</description>

      <title>Latent Zoning Network: A Unified Principle for Generative Modeling, Representation Learning, and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15591</link>

Abstract: Generative modeling, representation learning, and classification are three core problems in machine learning (ML), yet their state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions remain largely disjoint. In this paper, we ask: Can a unified principle address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and foster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN) as a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent space that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images, text, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent zones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as compositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional image generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses an image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We demonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN can enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA Rectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without modifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently (representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation learning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and SimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear classification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously (joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders, LZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA classification accuracy on CIFAR10. The code and trained models are available at https://github.com/microsoft/latent-zoning-networks. The project website is at https://zinanlin.me/blogs/latent_zoning_networks.html.</description>

      <title>MultiSoundGen: Video-to-Audio Generation for Multi-Event Scenarios via SlowFast Contrastive Audio-Visual Pretraining and Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current video-to-audio (V2A) methods struggle in complex multi-event scenarios (video scenarios involving multiple sound sources, sound events, or transitions) due to two critical limitations. First, existing methods face challenges in precisely aligning intricate semantic information together with rapid dynamic features. Second, foundational training lacks quantitative preference optimization for semantic-temporal alignment and audio quality. As a result, it fails to enhance integrated generation quality in cluttered multi-event scenes. To address these core limitations, this study proposes a novel V2A framework: MultiSoundGen. It introduces direct preference optimization (DPO) into the V2A domain, leveraging audio-visual pretraining (AVP) to enhance performance in complex multi-event scenarios. Our contributions include two key innovations: the first is SlowFast Contrastive AVP (SF-CAVP), a pioneering AVP model with a unified dual-stream architecture. SF-CAVP explicitly aligns core semantic representations and rapid dynamic features of audio-visual data to handle multi-event complexity; second, we integrate the DPO method into V2A task and propose AVP-Ranked Preference Optimization (AVP-RPO). It uses SF-CAVP as a reward model to quantify and prioritize critical semantic-temporal matches while enhancing audio quality. Experiments demonstrate that MultiSoundGen achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multi-event scenarios, delivering comprehensive gains across distribution matching, audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization. Demos are available at https://v2aresearch.github.io/MultiSoundGen/.</description>

      <title>SatFusion: A Unified Framework for Enhancing Satellite IoT Images via Multi-Temporal and Multi-Source Data Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital society, the proliferation of satellites in the Satellite Internet of Things (Sat-IoT) has led to the continuous accumulation of large-scale multi-temporal and multi-source images across diverse application scenarios. However, existing methods fail to fully exploit the complementary information embedded in both temporal and source dimensions. For example, Multi-Image Super-Resolution (MISR) enhances reconstruction quality by leveraging temporal complementarity across multiple observations, yet the limited fine-grained texture details in input images constrain its performance. Conversely, pansharpening integrates multi-source images by injecting high-frequency spatial information from panchromatic data, but typically relies on pre-interpolated low-resolution inputs and assumes noise-free alignment, making it highly sensitive to noise and misregistration. To address these issues, we propose SatFusion: A Unified Framework for Enhancing Satellite IoT Images via Multi-Temporal and Multi-Source Data Fusion. Specifically, SatFusion first employs a Multi-Temporal Image Fusion (MTIF) module to achieve deep feature alignment with the panchromatic image. Then, a Multi-Source Image Fusion (MSIF) module injects fine-grained texture information from the panchromatic data. Finally, a Fusion Composition module adaptively integrates the complementary advantages of both modalities while dynamically refining spectral consistency, supervised by a weighted combination of multiple loss functions. Extensive experiments on the WorldStrat, WV3, QB, and GF2 datasets demonstrate that SatFusion significantly improves fusion quality, robustness under challenging conditions, and generalizability to real-world Sat-IoT scenarios.

      <title>GS-Verse: Mesh-based Gaussian Splatting for Physics-aware Interaction in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the demand for immersive 3D content grows, the need for intuitive and efficient interaction methods becomes paramount. Current techniques for physically manipulating 3D content within Virtual Reality (VR) often face significant limitations, including reliance on engineering-intensive processes and simplified geometric representations, such as tetrahedral cages, which can compromise visual fidelity and physical accuracy. In this paper, we introduce GS-Verse (Gaussian Splatting for Virtual Environment Rendering and Scene Editing), a novel method designed to overcome these challenges by directly integrating an object's mesh with a Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation. Our approach enables more precise surface approximation, leading to highly realistic deformations and interactions. By leveraging existing 3D mesh assets, GS-Verse facilitates seamless content reuse and simplifies the development workflow. Moreover, our system is designed to be physics-engine-agnostic, granting developers robust deployment flexibility. This versatile architecture delivers a highly realistic, adaptable, and intuitive approach to interactive 3D manipulation. We rigorously validate our method against the current state-of-the-art technique that couples VR with GS in a comparative user study involving 18 participants. Specifically, we demonstrate that our approach is statistically significantly better for physics-aware stretching manipulation and is also more consistent in other physics-based manipulations like twisting and shaking. Further evaluation across various interactions and scenes confirms that our method consistently delivers high and reliable performance, showing its potential as a plausible alternative to existing methods.</description>

      <title>DiffVLA++: Bridging Cognitive Reasoning and End-to-End Driving through Metric-Guided Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17148v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional end-to-end (E2E) driving models are effective at generating physically plausible trajectories, but often fail to generalize to long-tail scenarios due to the lack of essential world knowledge to understand and reason about surrounding environments. In contrast, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage world knowledge to handle challenging cases, but their limited 3D reasoning capability can lead to physically infeasible actions. In this work we introduce DiffVLA++, an enhanced autonomous driving framework that explicitly bridges cognitive reasoning and E2E planning through metric-guided alignment. First, we build a VLA module directly generating semantically grounded driving trajectories. Second, we design an E2E module with a dense trajectory vocabulary that ensures physical feasibility. Third, and most critically, we introduce a metric-guided trajectory scorer that guides and aligns the outputs of the VLA and E2E modules, thereby integrating their complementary strengths. The experiment on the ICCV 2025 Autonomous Grand Challenge leaderboard shows that DiffVLA++ achieves EPDMS of 49.12.</description>

      <title>Kinematify: Open-Vocabulary Synthesis of High-DoF Articulated Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A deep understanding of kinematic structures and movable components is essential for enabling robots to manipulate objects and model their own articulated forms. Such understanding is captured through articulated objects, which are essential for tasks such as physical simulation, motion planning, and policy learning. However, creating these models, particularly for objects with high degrees of freedom (DoF), remains a significant challenge. Existing methods typically rely on motion sequences or strong assumptions from hand-curated datasets, which hinders scalability. In this paper, we introduce Kinematify, an automated framework that synthesizes articulated objects directly from arbitrary RGB images or textual descriptions. Our method addresses two core challenges: (i) inferring kinematic topologies for high-DoF objects and (ii) estimating joint parameters from static geometry. To achieve this, we combine MCTS search for structural inference with geometry-driven optimization for joint reasoning, producing physically consistent and functionally valid descriptions. We evaluate Kinematify on diverse inputs from both synthetic and real-world environments, demonstrating improvements in registration and kinematic topology accuracy over prior work.</description>
