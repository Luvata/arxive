      <title>Interpretability in Action: Exploratory Analysis of VPT, a Minecraft Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms behind decisions taken by large foundation models in sequential decision making tasks is critical to ensuring that such systems operate transparently and safely. In this work, we perform exploratory analysis on the Video PreTraining (VPT) Minecraft playing agent, one of the largest open-source vision-based agents. We aim to illuminate its reasoning mechanisms by applying various interpretability techniques. First, we analyze the attention mechanism while the agent solves its training task - crafting a diamond pickaxe. The agent pays attention to the last four frames and several key-frames further back in its six-second memory. This is a possible mechanism for maintaining coherence in a task that takes 3-10 minutes, despite the short memory span. Secondly, we perform various interventions, which help us uncover a worrying case of goal misgeneralization: VPT mistakenly identifies a villager wearing brown clothes as a tree trunk when the villager is positioned stationary under green tree leaves, and punches it to death.</description>

      <title>Evaluating graph-based explanations for AI-based recommender systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth of recommender systems, providing suggestions in numerous applications with potentially high social impact, such as health or justice. Meanwhile, in Europe, the upcoming AI Act mentions \emph{transparency} as a requirement for critical AI systems in order to ``mitigate the risks to fundamental rights''. Post-hoc explanations seamlessly align with this goal and extensive literature on the subject produced several forms of such objects, graphs being one of them. Early studies in visualization demonstrated the graphs' ability to improve user understanding, positioning them as potentially ideal explanations. However, it remains unclear how graph-based explanations compare to other explanation designs. In this work, we aim to determine the effectiveness of graph-based explanations in improving users' perception of AI-based recommendations using a mixed-methods approach. We first conduct a qualitative study to collect users' requirements for graph explanations. We then run a larger quantitative study in which we evaluate the influence of various explanation designs, including enhanced graph-based ones, on aspects such as understanding, usability and curiosity toward the AI system. We find that users perceive graph-based explanations as more usable than designs involving feature importance. However, we also reveal that textual explanations lead to higher objective understanding than graph-based designs. Most importantly, we highlight the strong contrast between participants' expressed preferences for graph design and their actual ratings using it, which are lower compared to textual design. These findings imply that meeting stakeholders' expressed preferences might not alone guarantee ``good'' explanations. Therefore, crafting hybrid designs successfully balancing social expectations with downstream performance emerges as a significant challenge.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Identification in Linear Structural Causal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning the unknown causal parameters of a linear structural causal model is a fundamental task in causal analysis. The task, known as the problem of identification, asks to estimate the parameters of the model from a combination of assumptions on the graphical structure of the model and observational data, represented as a non-causal covariance matrix. In this paper, we give a new sound and complete algorithm for generic identification which runs in polynomial space. By standard simulation results, this algorithm has exponential running time which vastly improves the state-of-the-art double exponential time method using a Gr\"obner basis approach. The paper also presents evidence that parameter identification is computationally hard in general. In particular, we prove, that the task asking whether, for a given feasible correlation matrix, there are exactly one or two or more parameter sets explaining the observed matrix, is hard for $\forall R$, the co-class of the existential theory of the reals. In particular, this problem is $coNP$-hard. To our best knowledge, this is the first hardness result for some notion of identifiability.</description>

      <title>An efficient machine learning approach for extracting eSports players distinguishing features and classifying their skill levels using symbolic transfer entropy and consensus nested cross validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering features that set elite players apart is of great significance for eSports coaches as it enables them to arrange a more effective training program focused on improving those features. Moreover, finding such features results in a better evaluation of eSports players skills, which, besides coaches, is of interest for game developers to design games automatically adaptable to the players expertise. Sensor data combined with machine learning have already proved effective in classifying eSports players. However, the existing methods do not provide sufficient information about features that distinguish high-skilled players. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to find these features and then use them to classify players' skill levels. We first apply a time window to extract the players' sensor data, including heart rate, hand activities, etc., before and after game events in the League of Legends game. We use the extracted segments and symbolic transfer entropy to calculate connectivity features between sensors. The most relevant features are then selected using the newly developed consensus nested cross validation method. These features, representing the harmony between body parts, are finally used to find the optimum window size and classify players' skills. The classification results demonstrate a significant improvement by achieving 90.1% accuracy. Also, connectivity features between players gaze positions and keyboard, mouse, and hand activities were the most distinguishing features in classifying players' skills. The proposed method in this paper can be similarly applied to sportspeople data and potentially revolutionize the training programs in both eSports and sports industries</description>

      <title>Preliminary Study of the Impact of AI-Based Interventions on Health and Behavioral Outcomes in Maternal Health Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated voice calls are an effective method of delivering maternal and child health information to mothers in underserved communities. One method to fight dwindling listenership is through an intervention in which health workers make live service calls. Previous work has shown that we can use AI to identify beneficiaries whose listenership gets the greatest boost from an intervention. It has also been demonstrated that listening to the automated voice calls consistently leads to improved health outcomes for the beneficiaries of the program. These two observations combined suggest the positive effect of AI-based intervention scheduling on behavioral and health outcomes. This study analyzes the relationship between the two. Specifically, we are interested in mothers' health knowledge in the post-natal period, measured through survey questions. We present evidence that improved listenership through AI-scheduled interventions leads to a better understanding of key health issues during pregnancy and infancy. This improved understanding has the potential to benefit the health outcomes of mothers and their babies.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI Enhances Glaucoma Referrals, Yet the Human-AI Team Still Falls Short of the AI Alone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primary care providers are vital for initial triage and referrals to specialty care. In glaucoma, asymptomatic and fast progression can lead to vision loss, necessitating timely referrals to specialists. However, primary eye care providers may not identify urgent cases, potentially delaying care. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offering explanations could enhance their referral decisions. We investigate how various AI explanations help providers distinguish between patients needing immediate or non-urgent specialist referrals. We built explainable AI algorithms to predict glaucoma surgery needs from routine eyecare data as a proxy for identifying high-risk patients. We incorporated intrinsic and post-hoc explainability and conducted an online study with optometrists to assess human-AI team performance, measuring referral accuracy and analyzing interactions with AI, including agreement rates, task time, and user experience perceptions. AI support enhanced referral accuracy among 87 participants (59.9%/50.8% with/without AI), though Human-AI teams underperformed compared to AI alone. Participants believed they included AI advice more when using the intrinsic model, and perceived it more useful and promising. Without explanations, deviations from AI recommendations increased. AI support did not increase workload, confidence, and trust, but reduced challenges. On a separate test set, our black-box and intrinsic models achieved an accuracy of 77% and 71%, respectively, in predicting surgical outcomes. We identify opportunities of human-AI teaming for glaucoma management in primary eye care, noting that while AI enhances referral accuracy, it also shows a performance gap compared to AI alone, even with explanations. Human involvement remains essential in medical decision making, underscoring the need for future research to optimize collaboration, ensuring positive experiences and safe AI use.</description>

      <title>Building Better AI Agents: A Provocation on the Utilisation of Persona in LLM-based Conversational Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as the GPT series into diverse sectors including healthcare, education, and finance marks a significant evolution in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The increasing demand for personalised applications motivated the design of conversational agents (CAs) to possess distinct personas. This paper commences by examining the rationale and implications of imbuing CAs with unique personas, smoothly transitioning into a broader discussion of the personalisation and anthropomorphism of CAs based on LLMs in the LLM era. We delve into the specific applications where the implementation of a persona is not just beneficial but critical for LLM-based CAs. The paper underscores the necessity of a nuanced approach to persona integration, highlighting the potential challenges and ethical dilemmas that may arise. Attention is directed towards the importance of maintaining persona consistency, establishing robust evaluation mechanisms, and ensuring that the persona attributes are effectively complemented by domain-specific knowledge.</description>

      <title>"It depends": Configuring AI to Improve Clinical Usefulness Across Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) repeatedly match or outperform radiologists in lab experiments. However, real-world implementations of radiological AI-based systems are found to provide little to no clinical value. This paper explores how to design AI for clinical usefulness in different contexts. We conducted 19 design sessions and design interventions with 13 radiologists from 7 clinical sites in Denmark and Kenya, based on three iterations of a functional AI-based prototype. Ten sociotechnical dependencies were identified as crucial for the design of AI in radiology. We conceptualised four technical dimensions that must be configured to the intended clinical context of use: AI functionality, AI medical focus, AI decision threshold, and AI Explainability. We present four design recommendations on how to address dependencies pertaining to the medical knowledge, clinic type, user expertise level, patient context, and user situation that condition the configuration of these technical dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and initial assessment of a novel device that uses generative AI to facilitate creative ideation, inspiration, and reflective thought. Inspired by magnetic poetry, which was originally designed to help overcome writer's block, the device allows participants to compose short poetic texts from a limited vocabulary by physically placing words on the device's surface. Upon composing the text, the system employs a large language model (LLM) to generate a response, displayed on an e-ink screen. We explored various strategies for internally sequencing prompts to foster creative thinking, including analogy, allegorical interpretations, and ideation. We installed the device in our research laboratory for two weeks and held a focus group at the conclusion to evaluate the design. The design choice to limit interactions with the LLM to poetic text, coupled with the tactile experience of assembling the poem, fostered a deeper and more enjoyable engagement with the LLM compared to traditional chatbot or screen-based interactions. This approach gives users the opportunity to reflect on the AI-generated responses in a manner conducive to creative thought.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When an applicant files an online application, there is usually a requirement to fill the marks in the online form and also upload the marksheet in the portal for the verification. A system was built for reading the uploaded marksheet using OCR and automatically filling the rows/ columns in the online form. Though there are partial solutions to this problem - implemented using PyTesseract - the accuracy is low. Hence, the PaddleOCR was used to build the marksheet parser. Several pre-processing and post-processing steps were also performed. The system was tested and evaluated for seven states. Further work is being done and the system is being evaluated for more states and boards of India.</description>

      <title>SlicerChat: Building a Local Chatbot for 3D Slicer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Slicer is a powerful platform for 3D data visualization and analysis, but has a significant learning curve for new users. Generative AI applications, such as ChatGPT, have emerged as a potential method of bridging the gap between various sources of documentation using natural language. The limited exposure of LLM services to 3D Slicer documentation, however, means that ChatGPT and related services tend to suffer from significant hallucination. The objective of this project is to build a chatbot architecture, called SlicerChat, that is optimized to answer 3D Slicer related questions and able to run locally using an open-source model. The core research questions explored in this work revolve around the answer quality and speed differences due to fine-tuning, model size, and the type of domain knowledge included in the prompt. A prototype SlicerChat system was built as a custom extension in 3D Slicer based on the Code-Llama Instruct architecture. Models of size 1.1B, 7B and 13B were fine-tuned using Low rank Adaptation, and various sources of 3D Slicer documentation were compiled for use in a Retrieval Augmented Generation paradigm. Testing combinations of fine-tuning and model sizes on a benchmark dataset of five 3D Slicer questions revealed that fine-tuning had no impact on model performance or speed compared to the base architecture, and that larger models performed better with a significant speed decrease. Experiments with adding 3D Slicer documentation to the prompt showed that Python sample code and Markdown documentation were the most useful information to include, but that adding 3D Slicer scene data and questions taken from Discourse also improved model performance. In conclusion, this project shows the potential for integrating a high quality, local chatbot directly into 3D Slicer to help new users and experienced developers alike to more efficiently use the software.</description>

Abstract: Digital twins belong to ten of the strategic technology trends according to the Gartner list from 2019, and have encountered a big expansion, especially with the introduction of Industry 4.0. Sport, on the other hand, has become a constant companion of the modern human suffering a lack of a healthy way of life. The application of digital twins in sport has brought dramatic changes not only in the domain of sport training, but also in managing athletes during competitions, searching for strategical solutions before and tactical solutions during the games by coaches. In this paper, the domain of digital twins in sport is reviewed based on papers which have emerged in this area. At first, the concept of a digital twin is discussed in general. Then, taxonomies of digital twins are appointed. According to these taxonomies, the collection of relevant papers is analyzed, and some real examples of digital twins are exposed. The review finishes with a discussion about how the digital twins affect changes in the modern sport disciplines, and what challenges and opportunities await the digital twins in the future.</description>

      <title>Inspired by AI? A Novel Generative AI System To Assist Conceptual Automotive Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Design inspiration is crucial for establishing the direction of a design as well as evoking feelings and conveying meanings during the conceptual design process. Many practice designers use text-based searches on platforms like Pinterest to gather image ideas, followed by sketching on paper or using digital tools to develop concepts. Emerging generative AI techniques, such as diffusion models, offer a promising avenue to streamline these processes by swiftly generating design concepts based on text and image inspiration inputs, subsequently using the AI generated design concepts as fresh sources of inspiration for further concept development. However, applying these generative AI techniques directly within a design context has challenges. Firstly, generative AI tools may exhibit a bias towards particular styles, resulting in a lack of diversity of design outputs. Secondly, these tools may struggle to grasp the nuanced meanings of texts or images in a design context. Lastly, the lack of integration with established design processes within design teams can result in fragmented use scenarios. Focusing on these challenges, we conducted workshops, surveys, and data augmentation involving teams of experienced automotive designers to investigate their current practices in generating concepts inspired by texts and images, as well as their preferred interaction modes for generative AI systems to support the concept generation workflow. Finally, we developed a novel generative AI system based on diffusion models to assist conceptual automotive design.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Contextually Personalized Programming Exercises Created with Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programming skills are typically developed through completing various hands-on exercises. Such programming problems can be contextualized to students' interests and cultural backgrounds. Prior research in educational psychology has demonstrated that context personalization of exercises stimulates learners' situational interests and positively affects their engagement. However, creating a varied and comprehensive set of programming exercises for students to practice on is a time-consuming and laborious task for computer science educators. Previous studies have shown that large language models can generate conceptually and contextually relevant programming exercises. Thus, they offer a possibility to automatically produce personalized programming problems to fit students' interests and needs. This article reports on a user study conducted in an elective introductory programming course that included contextually personalized programming exercises created with GPT-4. The quality of the exercises was evaluated by both the students and the authors. Additionally, this work investigated student attitudes towards the created exercises and their engagement with the system. The results demonstrate that the quality of exercises generated with GPT-4 was generally high. What is more, the course participants found them engaging and useful. This suggests that AI-generated programming problems can be a worthwhile addition to introductory programming courses, as they provide students with a practically unlimited pool of practice material tailored to their personal interests and educational needs.</description>

      <title>An investigation into the scientific landscape of the conversational and generative artificial intelligence, and human-chatbot interaction in education and research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) as a disruptive technology is not new. However, its recent evolution, engineered by technological transformation, big data analytics, and quantum computing, produces conversational and generative AI (CGAI/GenAI) and human-like chatbots that disrupt conventional operations and methods in different fields. This study investigates the scientific landscape of CGAI and human-chatbot interaction/collaboration and evaluates use cases, benefits, challenges, and policy implications for multidisciplinary education and allied industry operations. The publications trend showed that just 4% (n=75) occurred during 2006-2018, while 2019-2023 experienced astronomical growth (n=1763 or 96%). The prominent use cases of CGAI (e.g., ChatGPT) for teaching, learning, and research activities occurred in computer science [multidisciplinary and AI] (32%), medical/healthcare (17%), engineering (7%), and business fields (6%). The intellectual structure shows strong collaboration among eminent multidisciplinary sources in business, Information Systems, and other areas. The thematic structure of SLP highlights prominent CGAI use cases, including improved user experience in human-computer interaction, computer programs/code generation, and systems creation. Widespread CGAI usefulness for teachers, researchers, and learners includes syllabi/course content generation, testing aids, and academic writing. The concerns about abuse and misuse (plagiarism, academic integrity, privacy violations) and issues about misinformation, danger of self-diagnoses, and patient privacy in medical/healthcare applications are prominent. Formulating strategies and policies to address potential CGAI challenges in teaching/learning and practice are priorities. Developing discipline-based automatic detection of GenAI contents to check abuse is proposed.</description>

      <title>People will agree what I think: Investigating LLM's False Consensus Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been widely adopted on interactive systems requiring communications. As the false belief in a model can harm the usability of such systems, LLMs should not have cognitive biases that humans have. Especially psychologists focused on the False Consensus Effect (FCE), which can distract smooth communication by posing false beliefs. However, previous studies have less examined FCE in LLMs thoroughly, which needs more consideration of confounding biases, general situations, and prompt changes. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct two studies to deeply examine the FCE phenomenon in LLMs. In Study 1, we investigate whether LLMs have FCE. In Study 2, we explore how various prompting styles affect the demonstration of FCE. As a result of these studies, we identified that popular LLMs have FCE. Also, the result specifies the conditions when the strength of FCE becomes larger or smaller compared to normal usage.</description>

      <title>Using Multimodal Foundation Models and Clustering for Improved Style Ambiguity Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teaching text-to-image models to be creative involves using style ambiguity loss, which requires a pretrained classifier. In this work, we explore a new form of the style ambiguity training objective, used to approximate creativity, that does not require training a classifier or even a labeled dataset. We then train a diffusion model to maximize style ambiguity to imbue the diffusion model with creativity and find our new methods improve upon the traditional method, based on automated metrics for human judgment, while still maintaining creativity and novelty.</description>

      <title>Digital Twinning of a Pressurized Water Reactor Startup Operation and Partial Computational Offloading in In-network Computing-Assisted Multiaccess Edge Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of representing complex human action (HA) in a nuclear power plant (NPP) digital twin (DT) and minimizing latency in partial computation offloading (PCO) in sixth-generation-enabled computing in the network (COIN) assisted multiaccess edge computing (MEC). Accurate HA representation in the DT-HA model is vital for modeling human interventions that are crucial for the safe and efficient operation of NPPs. In this context, DT-enabled COIN-assisted MEC harnesses DT (known as a cybertwin) capabilities to optimize resource allocation and reduce latency effectively. A two-stage approach is employed to address system complexity. First, a probabilistic graphical model (PGM) is introduced to capture HAs in the DT abstraction. In the PGM, HA and NPP asset-twin abstractions form coupled systems that evolve and interact through observable data and control input. Next, the underlying PCO problem is formulated as a multiuser game, where NPP assets can partially offload tasks to COIN and MEC. We propose a decentralized algorithm to optimize offloading decisions, offloading ratios, and resource allocation. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing complex HAs and optimal resource allocation in DT-enabled NPPs.</description>

      <title>Dating ancient manuscripts using radiocarbon and AI-based writing style analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the chronology of ancient handwritten manuscripts is essential for reconstructing the evolution of ideas. For the Dead Sea Scrolls, this is particularly important. However, there is an almost complete lack of date-bearing manuscripts evenly distributed across the timeline and written in similar scripts available for palaeographic comparison. Here, we present Enoch, a state-of-the-art AI-based date-prediction model, trained on the basis of new radiocarbon-dated samples of the scrolls. Enoch uses established handwriting-style descriptors and applies Bayesian ridge regression. The challenge of this study is that the number of radiocarbon-dated manuscripts is small, while current machine learning requires an abundance of training data. We show that by using combined angular and allographic writing style feature vectors and applying Bayesian ridge regression, Enoch could predict the radiocarbon-based dates from style, supported by leave-one-out validation, with varied MAEs of 27.9 to 30.7 years relative to the radiocarbon dating. Enoch was then used to estimate the dates of 135 unseen manuscripts, revealing that 79 per cent of the samples were considered 'realistic' upon palaeographic post-hoc evaluation. We present a new chronology of the scrolls. The radiocarbon ranges and Enoch's style-based predictions are often older than the traditionally assumed palaeographic estimates. In the range of 300-50 BCE, Enoch's date prediction provides an improved granularity. The study is in line with current developments in multimodal machine-learning techniques, and the methods can be used for date prediction in other partially-dated manuscript collections. This research shows how Enoch's quantitative, probability-based approach can be a tool for palaeographers and historians, re-dating ancient Jewish key texts and contributing to current debates on Jewish and Christian origins.</description>

      <title>The Great AI Witch Hunt: Reviewers Perception and (Mis)Conception of Generative AI in Research Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) use in research writing is growing fast. However, it is unclear how peer reviewers recognize or misjudge AI-augmented manuscripts. To investigate the impact of AI-augmented writing on peer reviews, we conducted a snippet-based online survey with 17 peer reviewers from top-tier HCI conferences. Our findings indicate that while AI-augmented writing improves readability, language diversity, and informativeness, it often lacks research details and reflective insights from authors. Reviewers consistently struggled to distinguish between human and AI-augmented writing but their judgements remained consistent. They noted the loss of a "human touch" and subjective expressions in AI-augmented writing. Based on our findings, we advocate for reviewer guidelines that promote impartial evaluations of submissions, regardless of any personal biases towards GenAI. The quality of the research itself should remain a priority in reviews, regardless of any preconceived notions about the tools used to create it. We emphasize that researchers must maintain their authorship and control over the writing process, even when using GenAI's assistance.</description>

      <title>LLM-based Frameworks for API Argument Filling in Task-Oriented Conversational Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task-orientated conversational agents interact with users and assist them via leveraging external APIs. A typical task-oriented conversational system can be broken down into three phases: external API selection, argument filling, and response generation. The focus of our work is the task of argument filling, which is in charge of accurately providing arguments required by the selected API. Upon comprehending the dialogue history and the pre-defined API schema, the argument filling task is expected to provide the external API with the necessary information to generate a desirable agent action. In this paper, we study the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for the problem of API argument filling task. Our initial investigation reveals that LLMs require an additional grounding process to successfully perform argument filling, inspiring us to design training and prompting frameworks to ground their responses. Our experimental results demonstrate that when paired with proposed techniques, the argument filling performance of LLMs noticeably improves, paving a new way toward building an automated argument filling framework.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of Large Language Models generating follow up questions in response to user requests for short text documents. Users provided prompts requesting documents they would like the AI to produce. The AI then generated questions to clarify the user needs before generating the requested documents. Users answered the questions and then indicated their preference between a document generated using both the initial prompt and the questions and answers, and a document generated using only the initial prompt, and gave feedback about their experience with the question-answering process. The findings of this study show clear benefits to question-asking both in document preference and in the qualitative user experience.</description>

Abstract: Despite the extensive communication benefits offered by social media platforms, numerous challenges must be addressed to ensure user safety. One of the most significant risks faced by users on these platforms is targeted hate speech. Social media platforms are widely utilised for generating datasets employed in training and evaluating machine learning algorithms for hate speech detection. However, existing public datasets exhibit numerous limitations, hindering the effective training of these algorithms and leading to inaccurate hate speech classification. This study provides a comprehensive empirical evaluation of several public datasets commonly used in automated hate speech classification. Through rigorous analysis, we present compelling evidence highlighting the limitations of current hate speech datasets. Additionally, we conduct a range of statistical analyses to elucidate the strengths and weaknesses inherent in these datasets. This work aims to advance the development of more accurate and reliable machine learning models for hate speech detection by addressing the dataset limitations identified.</description>

      <title>DIM: Dynamic Integration of Multimodal Entity Linking with Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our study delves into Multimodal Entity Linking, aligning the mention in multimodal information with entities in knowledge base. Existing methods are still facing challenges like ambiguous entity representations and limited image information utilization. Thus, we propose dynamic entity extraction using ChatGPT, which dynamically extracts entities and enhances datasets. We also propose a method: Dynamically Integrate Multimodal information with knowledge base (DIM), employing the capability of the Large Language Model (LLM) for visual understanding. The LLM, such as BLIP-2, extracts information relevant to entities in the image, which can facilitate improved extraction of entity features and linking them with the dynamic entity representations provided by ChatGPT. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed DIM method outperforms the majority of existing methods on the three original datasets, and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the dynamically enhanced datasets (Wiki+, Rich+, Diverse+). For reproducibility, our code and collected datasets are released on \url{https://github.com/season1blue/DIM}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of fluency in sign language remains a barrier to seamless communication for hearing and speech-impaired communities. In this work, we propose a low-cost, real-time ASL-to-speech translation glove and an exhaustive training dataset of sign language patterns. We then benchmarked this dataset with supervised learning models, such as LSTMs, GRUs and Transformers, where our best model achieved 92% accuracy. The SignSpeak dataset has 7200 samples encompassing 36 classes (A-Z, 1-10) and aims to capture realistic signing patterns by using five low-cost flex sensors to measure finger positions at each time step at 36 Hz. Our open-source dataset, models and glove designs, provide an accurate and efficient ASL translator while maintaining cost-effectiveness, establishing a framework for future work to build on.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Draft-Verification for Efficient Large Language Model Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) decoding involves generating a sequence of tokens based on a given context, where each token is predicted one at a time using the model's learned probabilities. The typical autoregressive decoding method requires a separate forward pass through the model for each token generated, which is computationally inefficient and poses challenges for deploying LLMs in latency-sensitive scenarios. The main limitations of current decoding methods stem from their inefficiencies and resource demands. Existing approaches either necessitate fine-tuning smaller models, which is resource-intensive, or rely on fixed retrieval schemes to construct drafts for the next tokens, which lack adaptability and fail to generalize across different models and contexts. To address these issues, we introduce a novel methodology called ADED, which accelerates LLM decoding without requiring fine-tuning. Our approach involves an adaptive draft-verification process that evolves over time to improve efficiency. We utilize a tri-gram matrix-based LLM representation to dynamically approximate the output distribution of the LLM, allowing the model to adjust to changing token probabilities during the decoding process. Additionally, we implement a draft construction mechanism that effectively balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring that the drafts generated are both diverse and close to the true output distribution of the LLM. The importance of this design lies in its ability to optimize the draft distribution adaptively, leading to faster and more accurate decoding. Through extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets and LLM architectures, we demonstrate that ADED significantly accelerates the decoding process while maintaining high accuracy, making it suitable for deployment in a wide range of practical applications.</description>

      <title>ITERTL: An Iterative Framework for Fine-tuning LLMs for RTL Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent performance in understanding human instructions and generating code, which has inspired researchers to explore the feasibility of generating RTL code with LLMs. However, the existing approaches to fine-tune LLMs on RTL codes typically are conducted on fixed datasets, which do not fully stimulate the capability of LLMs and require large amounts of reference data. To mitigate these issues , we introduce a simple yet effective iterative training paradigm named ITERTL. During each iteration, samples are drawn from the model trained in the previous cycle. Then these new samples are employed for training in this loop. Through this iterative approach, the distribution mismatch between the model and the training samples is reduced. Additionally, the model is thus enabled to explore a broader generative space and receive more comprehensive feedback. Theoretical analyses are conducted to investigate the mechanism of the effectiveness. Experimental results show the model trained through our proposed approach can compete with and even outperform the state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source model with nearly 37\% reference samples, achieving remarkable 42.9\% and 62.2\% pass@1 rate on two VerilogEval evaluation datasets respectively. While using the same amount of reference samples, our method can achieved a relative improvement of 16.9\% and 12.5\% in pass@1 compared to the non-iterative method. This study facilitates the application of LLMs for generating RTL code in practical scenarios with limited data.</description>

Abstract: Due to the rapid advancements in multimodal large language models, evaluating their multimodal mathematical capabilities continues to receive wide attention. Despite the datasets like MathVista proposed benchmarks for assessing mathematical capabilities in multimodal scenarios, there is still a lack of corresponding evaluation tools and datasets for fine-grained assessment in the context of K12 education in Chinese language. To systematically evaluate the capability of multimodal large models in solving Chinese multimodal mathematical problems, we propose a Chinese Multi-modal Math Skill Evaluation Benchmark, named CMMaTH, contraining 23k multimodal K12 math related questions, forming the largest Chinese multimodal mathematical problem benchmark to date. CMMaTH questions from elementary to high school levels, provide increased diversity in problem types, solution objectives, visual elements, detailed knowledge points, and standard solution annotations. We have constructed an open-source tool GradeGPT integrated with the CMMaTH dataset, facilitating stable, rapid, and cost-free model evaluation. Our data and code are available.</description>

Abstract: Smart home automation systems aim to improve the comfort and convenience of users in their living environment. However, adapting automation to user needs remains a challenge. Indeed, many systems still rely on hand-crafted routines for each smart object.This paper presents an original smart home architecture leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and user preferences to push the boundaries of personalisation and intuitiveness in the home environment.This article explores a human-centred approach that uses the general knowledge provided by LLMs to learn and facilitate interactions with the environment.The advantages of the proposed model are demonstrated on a set of scenarios, as well as a comparative analysis with various LLM implementations. Some metrics are assessed to determine the system's ability to maintain comfort, safety, and user preferences. The paper details the approach to real-world implementation and evaluation.The proposed approach of using preferences shows up to 52.3% increase in average grade, and with an average processing time reduced by 35.6% on Starling 7B Alpha LLM. In addition, performance is 26.4% better than the results of the larger models without preferences, with processing time almost 20 times faster.</description>

Abstract: This study introduces LLM4DESIGN, a highly automated system for generating architectural and environmental design proposals. LLM4DESIGN, relying solely on site conditions and design requirements, employs Multi-Agent systems to foster creativity, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground designs in realism, and Visual Language Models (VLM) to synchronize all information. This system resulting in coherent, multi-illustrated, and multi-textual design schemes. The system meets the dual needs of narrative storytelling and objective drawing presentation in generating architectural and environmental design proposals. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments confirm the innovativeness of LLM4DESIGN's narrative and the grounded applicability of its plans, demonstrating its superior performance in the field of urban renewal design. Lastly, we have created the first cross-modal design scheme dataset covering architecture, landscape, interior, and urban design, providing rich resources for future research.</description>

      <title>Idle is the New Sleep: Configuration-Aware Alternative to Powering Off FPGA-Based DL Accelerators During Inactivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving Internet of Things (IoT) domain, we concentrate on enhancing energy efficiency in Deep Learning accelerators on FPGA-based heterogeneous platforms, aligning with the principles of sustainable computing. Instead of focusing on the inference phase, we introduce innovative optimizations to minimize the overhead of the FPGA configuration phase. By fine-tuning configuration parameters correctly, we achieved a 40.13-fold reduction in configuration energy. Moreover, augmented with power-saving methods, our Idle-Waiting strategy outperformed the traditional On-Off strategy in duty-cycle mode for request periods up to 499.06 ms. Specifically, at a 40 ms request period within a 4147 J energy budget, this strategy extends the system lifetime to approximately 12.39x that of the On-Off strategy. Empirically validated through hardware measurements and simulations, these optimizations provide valuable insights and practical methods for achieving energy-efficient and sustainable deployments in IoT.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Bias Towards Medical Professionals in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit biases towards medical professionals. Fictitious candidate resumes were created to control for identity factors while maintaining consistent qualifications. Three LLMs (GPT-4, Claude-3-haiku, and Mistral-Large) were tested using a standardized prompt to evaluate resumes for specific residency programs. Explicit bias was tested by changing gender and race information, while implicit bias was tested by changing names while hiding race and gender. Physician data from the Association of American Medical Colleges was used to compare with real-world demographics. 900,000 resumes were evaluated. All LLMs exhibited significant gender and racial biases across medical specialties. Gender preferences varied, favoring male candidates in surgery and orthopedics, while preferring females in dermatology, family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, and psychiatry. Claude-3 and Mistral-Large generally favored Asian candidates, while GPT-4 preferred Black and Hispanic candidates in several specialties. Tests revealed strong preferences towards Hispanic females and Asian males in various specialties. Compared to real-world data, LLMs consistently chose higher proportions of female and underrepresented racial candidates than their actual representation in the medical workforce. GPT-4, Claude-3, and Mistral-Large showed significant gender and racial biases when evaluating medical professionals for residency selection. These findings highlight the potential for LLMs to perpetuate biases and compromise healthcare workforce diversity if used without proper bias mitigation strategies.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we explore the transformative potential of integrating generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), into behavioral and experimental economics to enhance internal validity. By leveraging AI tools, researchers can improve adherence to key exclusion restrictions and in particular ensure the internal validity measures of mental models, which often require human intervention in the incentive mechanism. We present a case study demonstrating how LLMs can enhance experimental design, participant engagement, and the validity of measuring mental models.</description>

      <title>Understanding Transformers via N-gram Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer based large-language models (LLMs) display extreme proficiency with language yet a precise understanding of how they work remains elusive. One way of demystifying transformer predictions would be to describe how they depend on their context in terms of simple template functions. This paper takes a first step in this direction by considering families of functions (i.e. rules) formed out of simple N-gram based statistics of the training data. By studying how well these rulesets approximate transformer predictions, we obtain a variety of novel discoveries: a simple method to detect overfitting during training without using a holdout set, a quantitative measure of how transformers progress from learning simple to more complex statistical rules over the course of training, a model-variance criterion governing when transformer predictions tend to be described by N-gram rules, and insights into how well transformers can be approximated by N-gram rulesets in the limit where these rulesets become increasingly complex. In this latter direction, we find that for 78% of LLM next-token distributions on TinyStories, their top-1 predictions agree with those provided by our N-gram rulesets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly employed to enhance assistive technologies, yet it can fail in various ways. We conducted a systematic literature review of research into AI-based assistive technology for persons with visual impairments. Our study shows that most proposed technologies with a testable prototype have not been evaluated in a human study with members of the sight-loss community. Furthermore, many studies did not consider or report failure cases or possible risks. These findings highlight the importance of inclusive system evaluations and the necessity of standardizing methods for presenting and analyzing failure cases and threats when developing AI-based assistive technologies.</description>

Abstract: The Inspirational and Convincing Audio Generation Challenge 2024 (ICAGC 2024) is part of the ISCSLP 2024 Competitions and Challenges track. While current text-to-speech (TTS) technology can generate high-quality audio, its ability to convey complex emotions and controlled detail content remains limited. This constraint leads to a discrepancy between the generated audio and human subjective perception in practical applications like companion robots for children and marketing bots. The core issue lies in the inconsistency between high-quality audio generation and the ultimate human subjective experience. Therefore, this challenge aims to enhance the persuasiveness and acceptability of synthesized audio, focusing on human alignment convincing and inspirational audio generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study performed an extensive evaluation of the performances of all configurations of YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10 object detection algorithms for fruitlet (of green fruit) detection in commercial orchards. Additionally, this research performed and validated in-field counting of fruitlets using an iPhone and machine vision sensors in 5 different apple varieties (Scifresh, Scilate, Honeycrisp, Cosmic crisp &amp; Golden delicious). This comprehensive investigation of total 17 different configurations (5 for YOLOv8, 6 for YOLOv9 and 6 for YOLOv10) revealed that YOLOv9 outperforms YOLOv10 and YOLOv8 in terms of mAP@50, while YOLOv10x outperformed all 17 configurations tested in terms of precision and recall. Specifically, YOLOv9 Gelan-e achieved the highest mAP@50 of 0.935, outperforming YOLOv10n's 0.921 and YOLOv8s's 0.924. In terms of precision, YOLOv10x achieved the highest precision of 0.908, indicating superior object identification accuracy compared to other configurations tested (e.g. YOLOv9 Gelan-c with a precision of 0.903 and YOLOv8m with 0.897. In terms of recall, YOLOv10s achieved the highest in its series (0.872), while YOLOv9 Gelan m performed the best among YOLOv9 configurations (0.899), and YOLOv8n performed the best among the YOLOv8 configurations (0.883). Meanwhile, three configurations of YOLOv10: YOLOv10b, YOLOv10l, and YOLOv10x achieved superior post-processing speeds of 1.5 milliseconds, outperforming all other configurations within the YOLOv9 and YOLOv8 families. Specifically, YOLOv9 Gelan-e recorded a post-processing speed of 1.9 milliseconds, and YOLOv8m achieved 2.1 milliseconds. Furthermore, YOLOv8n exhibited the highest inference speed among all configurations tested, achieving a processing time of 4.1 milliseconds while YOLOv9 Gelan-t and YOLOv10n also demonstrated comparatively slower inference speeds of 9.3 ms and 5.5 ms, respectively.</description>

      <title>The Art of Saying No: Contextual Noncompliance in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chat-based language models are designed to be helpful, yet they should not comply with every user request. While most existing work primarily focuses on refusal of "unsafe" queries, we posit that the scope of noncompliance should be broadened. We introduce a comprehensive taxonomy of contextual noncompliance describing when and how models should not comply with user requests. Our taxonomy spans a wide range of categories including incomplete, unsupported, indeterminate, and humanizing requests (in addition to unsafe requests). To test noncompliance capabilities of language models, we use this taxonomy to develop a new evaluation suite of 1000 noncompliance prompts. We find that most existing models show significantly high compliance rates in certain previously understudied categories with models like GPT-4 incorrectly complying with as many as 30% of requests. To address these gaps, we explore different training strategies using a synthetically-generated training set of requests and expected noncompliant responses. Our experiments demonstrate that while direct finetuning of instruction-tuned models can lead to both over-refusal and a decline in general capabilities, using parameter efficient methods like low rank adapters helps to strike a good balance between appropriate noncompliance and other capabilities.</description>

      <title>Dy-mer: An Explainable DNA Sequence Representation Scheme using Sparse Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DNA sequences encode vital genetic and biological information, yet these unfixed-length sequences cannot serve as the input of common data mining algorithms. Hence, various representation schemes have been developed to transform DNA sequences into fixed-length numerical representations. However, these schemes face difficulties in learning high-quality representations due to the complexity and sparsity of DNA data. Additionally, DNA sequences are inherently noisy because of mutations. While several schemes have been proposed for their effectiveness, they often lack semantic structure, making it difficult for biologists to validate and leverage the results. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Dy-mer}, an explainable and robust DNA representation scheme based on sparse recovery. Leveraging the underlying semantic structure of DNA, we modify the traditional sparse recovery to capture recurring patterns indicative of biological functions by representing frequent K-mers as basis vectors and reconstructing each DNA sequence through simple concatenation. Experimental results demonstrate that \textbf{Dy-mer} achieves state-of-the-art performance in DNA promoter classification, yielding a remarkable \textbf{13\%} increase in accuracy. Moreover, its inherent explainability facilitates DNA clustering and motif detection, enhancing its utility in biological research.</description>

      <title>Improving AlphaFlow for Efficient Protein Ensembles Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating conformational landscapes of proteins is a crucial way to understand their biological functions and properties. AlphaFlow stands out as a sequence-conditioned generative model that introduces flexibility into structure prediction models by fine-tuning AlphaFold under the flow-matching framework. Despite the advantages of efficient sampling afforded by flow-matching, AlphaFlow still requires multiple runs of AlphaFold to finally generate one single conformation. Due to the heavy consumption of AlphaFold, its applicability is limited in sampling larger set of protein ensembles or the longer chains within a constrained timeframe. In this work, we propose a feature-conditioned generative model called AlphaFlow-Lit to realize efficient protein ensembles generation. In contrast to the full fine-tuning on the entire structure, we focus solely on the light-weight structure module to reconstruct the conformation. AlphaFlow-Lit performs on-par with AlphaFlow and surpasses its distilled version without pretraining, all while achieving a significant sampling acceleration of around 47 times. The advancement in efficiency showcases the potential of AlphaFlow-Lit in enabling faster and more scalable generation of protein ensembles.</description>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques are widely used today to retrieve and present information in a conversational format. This paper presents a set of enhancements to traditional RAG techniques, focusing on large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned and hosted on AWS Trainium and Inferentia2 AI chips via SageMaker. These chips are characterized by their elasticity, affordability, and efficient performance for AI compute tasks. Besides enabling deployment on these chips, this work aims to improve tool usage, add citation capabilities, and mitigate the risks of hallucinations and unsafe responses due to context bias. We benchmark our RAG system's performance on the Natural Questions and HotPotQA datasets, achieving an accuracy of 62% and 59% respectively, exceeding other models such as DBRX and Mixtral Instruct.</description>

Abstract: Language is never spoken in a vacuum. It is expressed, comprehended, and contextualized within the holistic backdrop of the speaker's history, actions, and environment. Since humans are used to communicating efficiently with situated language, the practicality of robotic assistants hinge on their ability to understand and act upon implicit and situated instructions. In traditional instruction following paradigms, the agent acts alone in an empty house, leading to language use that is both simplified and artificially "complete." In contrast, we propose situated instruction following, which embraces the inherent underspecification and ambiguity of real-world communication with the physical presence of a human speaker. The meaning of situated instructions naturally unfold through the past actions and the expected future behaviors of the human involved. Specifically, within our settings we have instructions that (1) are ambiguously specified, (2) have temporally evolving intent, (3) can be interpreted more precisely with the agent's dynamic actions. Our experiments indicate that state-of-the-art Embodied Instruction Following (EIF) models lack holistic understanding of situated human intention.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multistep Brent Oil Price Forecasting with a Multi-Aspect Metaheuristic Optimization Approach and Ensemble Deep Learning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate crude oil price forecasting is crucial for various economic activities, including energy trading, risk management, and investment planning. Although deep learning models have emerged as powerful tools for crude oil price forecasting, achieving accurate forecasts remains challenging. Deep learning models' performance is heavily influenced by hyperparameters tuning, and they are expected to perform differently under various circumstances. Furthermore, price volatility is also sensitive to external factors such as world events. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid approach combining metaheuristic optimisation and an ensemble of five popular neural network architectures used in time series forecasting. Unlike existing methods that apply metaheuristics to optimise hyperparameters within the neural network architecture, we exploit the GWO metaheuristic optimiser at four levels: feature selection, data preparation, model training, and forecast blending. The proposed approach has been evaluated for forecasting three-ahead days using real-world Brent crude oil price data, and the obtained results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves the forecasting performance measured using various benchmarks, achieving 0.000127 of MSE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the popularity of autonomous vehicles has grown, many standards and regulators, such as ISO, NHTSA, and Euro NCAP, require safety validation to ensure a sufficient level of safety before deploying them in the real world. Manufacturers gather a large amount of public road data for this purpose. However, the majority of these validation activities are done manually by humans. Furthermore, the data used to validate each driving feature may differ. As a result, it is essential to have an efficient data selection method that can be used flexibly and dynamically for verification and validation while also accelerating the validation process. In this paper, we present a data selection method that is practical, flexible, and efficient for assessment of autonomous vehicles. Our idea is to optimize the similarity between the metadata distribution of the selected data and a predefined metadata distribution that is expected for validation. Our experiments on the large dataset BDD100K show that our method can perform data selection tasks efficiently. These results demonstrate that our methods are highly reliable and can be used to select appropriate data for the validation of various safety functions.</description>

      <title>Learning on Graphs with Large Language Models(LLMs): A Deep Dive into Model Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks. Recently, several LLMs-based pipelines have been developed to enhance learning on graphs with text attributes, showcasing promising performance. However, graphs are well-known to be susceptible to adversarial attacks and it remains unclear whether LLMs exhibit robustness in learning on graphs. To address this gap, our work aims to explore the potential of LLMs in the context of adversarial attacks on graphs. Specifically, we investigate the robustness against graph structural and textual perturbations in terms of two dimensions: LLMs-as-Enhancers and LLMs-as-Predictors. Through extensive experiments, we find that, compared to shallow models, both LLMs-as-Enhancers and LLMs-as-Predictors offer superior robustness against structural and textual attacks.Based on these findings, we carried out additional analyses to investigate the underlying causes. Furthermore, we have made our benchmark library openly available to facilitate quick and fair evaluations, and to encourage ongoing innovative research in this field.</description>

      <title>Co-Designing Binarized Transformer and Hardware Accelerator for Efficient End-to-End Edge Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized AI tasks, but their large size hinders real-world deployment on resource-constrained and latency-critical edge devices. While binarized Transformers offer a promising solution by significantly reducing model size, existing approaches suffer from algorithm-hardware mismatches with limited co-design exploration, leading to suboptimal performance on edge devices. Hence, we propose a co-design method for efficient end-to-end edge deployment of Transformers from three aspects: algorithm, hardware, and joint optimization. First, we propose BMT, a novel hardware-friendly binarized Transformer with optimized quantization methods and components, and we further enhance its model accuracy by leveraging the weighted ternary weight splitting training technique. Second, we develop a streaming processor mixed binarized Transformer accelerator, namely BAT, which is equipped with specialized units and scheduling pipelines for efficient inference of binarized Transformers. Finally, we co-optimize the algorithm and hardware through a design space exploration approach to achieve a global trade-off between accuracy, latency, and robustness for real-world deployments. Experimental results show our co-design achieves up to 2.14-49.37x throughput gains and 3.72-88.53x better energy efficiency over state-of-the-art Transformer accelerators, enabling efficient end-to-end edge deployment.</description>

      <title>Relational Representation Distillation</title>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for transferring knowledge from a large, well-trained teacher model to a smaller, more efficient student model. Despite its success, one of the main challenges in KD is ensuring the efficient transfer of complex knowledge while maintaining the student's computational efficiency. Unlike previous works that applied contrastive objectives promoting explicit negative instances, we introduce Relational Representation Distillation (RRD). Our approach leverages pairwise similarities to explore and reinforce the relationships between the teacher and student models. Inspired by self-supervised learning principles, it uses a relaxed contrastive loss that focuses on similarity rather than exact replication. This method aligns the output distributions of teacher samples in a large memory buffer, improving the robustness and performance of the student model without the need for strict negative instance differentiation. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on CIFAR-100, outperforming traditional KD techniques and surpassing 13 state-of-the-art methods. It also transfers successfully to other datasets like Tiny ImageNet and STL-10. The code will be made public soon.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Parameter Efficiency and Generalization in Large-Scale Models: A Regularized and Masked Low-Rank Adaptation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large pre-trained models, such as large language models (LLMs), present significant resource challenges for fine-tuning due to their extensive parameter sizes, especially for applications in mobile systems. To address this, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been developed to reduce resource consumption while maintaining satisfactory fine-tuning results. Despite its effectiveness, the original LoRA method faces challenges of suboptimal performance and overfitting. This paper investigates the intrinsic dimension of the matrix updates approximated by the LoRA method and reveals the performance benefits of increasing this intrinsic dimension. By employing regularization and a gradient masking method that encourages higher intrinsic dimension, the proposed method, termed Regularized and Masked LoRA (RM-LoRA), achieves superior generalization performance with the same or lower trainable parameter budget compared to the original LoRA and its latest variants across various open-source vision and language datasets.</description>

      <title>Tiled Bit Networks: Sub-Bit Neural Network Compression Through Reuse of Learnable Binary Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) enable efficient deep learning by saving on storage and computational costs. However, as the size of neural networks continues to grow, meeting computational requirements remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a new form of quantization to tile neural network layers with sequences of bits to achieve sub-bit compression of binary-weighted neural networks. The method learns binary vectors (i.e. tiles) to populate each layer of a model via aggregation and reshaping operations. During inference, the method reuses a single tile per layer to represent the full tensor. We employ the approach to both fully-connected and convolutional layers, which make up the breadth of space in most neural architectures. Empirically, the approach achieves near fullprecision performance on a diverse range of architectures (CNNs, Transformers, MLPs) and tasks (classification, segmentation, and time series forecasting) with up to an 8x reduction in size compared to binary-weighted models. We provide two implementations for Tiled Bit Networks: 1) we deploy the model to a microcontroller to assess its feasibility in resource-constrained environments, and 2) a GPU-compatible inference kernel to facilitate the reuse of a single tile per layer in memory.</description>

      <title>GoldFinch: High Performance RWKV/Transformer Hybrid with Linear Pre-Fill and Extreme KV-Cache Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce GoldFinch, a hybrid Linear Attention/Transformer sequence model that uses a new technique to efficiently generate a highly compressed and reusable KV-Cache in linear time and space with respect to sequence length. GoldFinch stacks our new GOLD transformer on top of an enhanced version of the Finch (RWKV-6) architecture. We train up to 1.5B parameter class models of the Finch, Llama, and GoldFinch architectures, and find dramatically improved modeling performance relative to both Finch and Llama. Our cache size savings increase linearly with model layer count, ranging from 756-2550 times smaller than the traditional transformer cache for common sizes, enabling inference of extremely large context lengths even on limited hardware. Although autoregressive generation has O(n) time complexity per token because of attention, pre-fill computation of the entire initial cache state for a submitted context costs only O(1) time per token due to the use of a recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate this cache. We release our trained weights and training code under the Apache 2.0 license for community use.</description>

      <title>Better RAG using Relevant Information Gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common way to extend the memory of large language models (LLMs) is by retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which inserts text retrieved from a larger memory into an LLM's context window. However, the context window is typically limited to several thousand tokens, which limits the number of retrieved passages that can inform a model's response. For this reason, it's important to avoid occupying context window space with redundant information by ensuring a degree of diversity among retrieved passages. At the same time, the information should also be relevant to the current task. Most prior methods that encourage diversity among retrieved results, such as Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR), do so by incorporating an objective that explicitly trades off diversity and relevance. We propose a novel simple optimization metric based on relevant information gain, a probabilistic measure of the total information relevant to a query for a set of retrieved results. By optimizing this metric, diversity organically emerges from our system. When used as a drop-in replacement for the retrieval component of a RAG system, this method yields state-of-the-art performance on question answering tasks from the Retrieval Augmented Generation Benchmark (RGB), outperforming existing metrics that directly optimize for relevance and diversity.</description>

      <title>A Graph-based Adversarial Imitation Learning Framework for Reliable &amp; Realtime Fleet Scheduling in Urban Air Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) presents the scope for a transformative shift in the domain of urban transportation. However, its widespread adoption and economic viability depends in part on the ability to optimally schedule the fleet of aircraft across vertiports in a UAM network, under uncertainties attributed to airspace congestion, changing weather conditions, and varying demands. This paper presents a comprehensive optimization formulation of the fleet scheduling problem, while also identifying the need for alternate solution approaches, since directly solving the resulting integer nonlinear programming problem is computationally prohibitive for daily fleet scheduling. Previous work has shown the effectiveness of using (graph) reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to train real-time executable policy models for fleet scheduling. However, such policies can often be brittle on out-of-distribution scenarios or edge cases. Moreover, training performance also deteriorates as the complexity (e.g., number of constraints) of the problem increases. To address these issues, this paper presents an imitation learning approach where the RL-based policy exploits expert demonstrations yielded by solving the exact optimization using a Genetic Algorithm. The policy model comprises Graph Neural Network (GNN) based encoders that embed the space of vertiports and aircraft, Transformer networks to encode demand, passenger fare, and transport cost profiles, and a Multi-head attention (MHA) based decoder. Expert demonstrations are used through the Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) algorithm. Interfaced with a UAM simulation environment involving 8 vertiports and 40 aircrafts, in terms of the daily profits earned reward, the new imitative approach achieves better mean performance and remarkable improvement in the case of unseen worst-case scenarios, compared to pure RL results.</description>

      <title>LLMs-in-the-loop Part-1: Expert Small AI Models for Bio-Medical Text Translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine translation is indispensable in healthcare for enabling the global dissemination of medical knowledge across languages. However, complex medical terminology poses unique challenges to achieving adequate translation quality and accuracy. This study introduces a novel "LLMs-in-the-loop" approach to develop supervised neural machine translation models optimized specifically for medical texts. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities, this research shows that small, specialized models trained on high-quality in-domain (mostly synthetic) data can outperform even vastly larger LLMs.
  Custom parallel corpora in six languages were compiled from scientific articles, synthetically generated clinical documents, and medical texts. Our LLMs-in-the-loop methodology employs synthetic data generation, rigorous evaluation, and agent orchestration to enhance performance. We developed small medical translation models using the MarianMT base model. We introduce a new medical translation test dataset to standardize evaluation in this domain. Assessed using BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and BERT scores on this test set, our MarianMT-based models outperform Google Translate, DeepL, and GPT-4-Turbo.
  Results demonstrate that our LLMs-in-the-loop approach, combined with fine-tuning high-quality, domain-specific data, enables specialized models to outperform general-purpose and some larger systems. This research, part of a broader series on expert small models, paves the way for future healthcare-related AI developments, including deidentification and bio-medical entity extraction models. Our study underscores the potential of tailored neural translation models and the LLMs-in-the-loop methodology to advance the field through improved data generation, evaluation, agent, and modeling techniques.</description>

      <title>Improving Health Information Access in the World's Largest Maternal Mobile Health Program via Bandit Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing the wide-spread availability of cell phones, many nonprofits have launched mobile health (mHealth) programs to deliver information via voice or text to beneficiaries in underserved communities, with maternal and infant health being a key area of such mHealth programs. Unfortunately, dwindling listenership is a major challenge, requiring targeted interventions using limited resources. This paper focuses on Kilkari, the world's largest mHealth program for maternal and child care - with over 3 million active subscribers at a time - launched by India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and run by the non-profit ARRMAN. We present a system called CHAHAK that aims to reduce automated dropouts as well as boost engagement with the program through the strategic allocation of interventions to beneficiaries. Past work in a similar domain has focused on a much smaller scale mHealth program and used markovian restless multiarmed bandits to optimize a single limited intervention resource. However this paper demonstrates the challenges in adopting a markovian approach in Kilkari; therefore CHAHAK instead relies on non-markovian time-series restless bandits, and optimizes multiple interventions to improve listenership. We use real Kilkari data from the Odisha state in India to show CHAHAK's effectiveness in harnessing multiple interventions to boost listenership, benefiting marginalized communities. When deployed CHAHAK will assist the largest maternal mHealth program to date.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy AI in practice: an analysis of practitioners' needs and challenges</title>

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing attention on behalf of both academic and practice communities towards the ability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems to operate responsibly and ethically. As a result, a plethora of frameworks and guidelines have appeared to support practitioners in implementing Trustworthy AI applications (TAI). However, little research has been done to investigate whether such frameworks are being used and how. In this work, we study the vision AI practitioners have on TAI principles, how they address them, and what they would like to have - in terms of tools, knowledge, or guidelines - when they attempt to incorporate such principles into the systems they develop. Through a survey and semi-structured interviews, we systematically investigated practitioners' challenges and needs in developing TAI systems. Based on these practical findings, we highlight recommendations to help AI practitioners develop Trustworthy AI applications.</description>

      <title>Predicting Emotion Intensity in Polish Political Texts: Comparing Supervised Models and Large Language Models in a Resource-Poor Language</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to predict emotion intensity in Polish political texts, a resource-poor language context. The research compares the performance of several LLMs against a supervised model trained on an annotated corpus of 10,000 social media texts, evaluated for the intensity of emotions by expert judges. The findings indicate that while the supervised model generally outperforms LLMs, offering higher accuracy and lower variance, LLMs present a viable alternative, especially given the high costs associated with data annotation. The study highlights the potential of LLMs in low-resource language settings and underscores the need for further research on emotion intensity prediction and its application across different languages and continuous features. The implications suggest a nuanced decision-making process to choose the right approach to emotion prediction for researchers and practitioners based on resource availability and the specific requirements of their tasks.</description>

Abstract: The deployment of AI systems for welfare benefit allocation allows for accelerated decision-making and faster provision of critical help, but has already led to an increase in unfair benefit denials and false fraud accusations. Collecting data in the US and the UK (N = 2449), we explore the public acceptability of such speed-accuracy trade-offs in populations of claimants and non-claimants. We observe a general willingness to trade off speed gains for modest accuracy losses, but this aggregate view masks notable divergences between claimants and non-claimants. Although welfare claimants comprise a relatively small proportion of the general population (e.g., 20% in the US representative sample), this vulnerable group is much less willing to accept AI deployed in welfare systems, raising concerns that solely using aggregate data for calibration could lead to policies misaligned with stakeholder preferences. Our study further uncovers asymmetric insights between claimants and non-claimants. The latter consistently overestimate claimant willingness to accept speed-accuracy trade-offs, even when financially incentivized for accurate perspective-taking. This suggests that policy decisions influenced by the dominant voice of non-claimants, however well-intentioned, may neglect the actual preferences of those directly affected by welfare AI systems. Our findings underline the need for stakeholder engagement and transparent communication in the design and deployment of these systems, particularly in contexts marked by power imbalances.</description>

Abstract: Contribution: The combination of ChatGPT with traditional learning resources is very effective in computer science education. High-performing students are the ones who are using ChatGPT the most. So, a new digital trench could be rising between these students and those with lower degree of fundamentals and worse prompting skills, who may not take advantage of all the ChatGPT possibilities. Background: The irruption of GenAI such as ChatGPT has changed the educational landscape. Therefore, methodological guidelines and more empirical experiences in computer science education are needed to better understand these tools and know how to use them to their fullest potential. Research Questions: This article addresses three questions. The first two explore the degree of use and perceived usefulness of ChatGPT among computer science students to learn database administration, where as the third one explore how the utilization of ChatGPT can impact academic performance. Methodology: This contribution presents an exploratory and correlational study conducted with 37 students who used ChatGPT as a support tool to learn database administration. The student grades and a comprehensive questionnaire were employed as research instruments. Findings: The obtained results indicate that traditional learning resources, such as teacher explanations and student reports, were widely used and correlated positively with student grade. The usage and perceived utility of ChatGPT were moderate, but positive correlations between student grade and ChatGPT usage were found. Indeed, a significantly higher use of this tool was identified among the group of outstanding students.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of Student Performance Predictions in Online Courses using Heterogeneous Knowledge Graphs</title>

Abstract: As online courses become the norm in the higher-education landscape, investigations into student performance between students who take online vs on-campus versions of classes become necessary. While attention has been given to looking at differences in learning outcomes through comparisons of students' end performance, less attention has been given in comparing students' engagement patterns between different modalities. In this study, we analyze a heterogeneous knowledge graph consisting of students, course videos, formative assessments and their interactions to predict student performance via a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Using students' performance on the assessments, we attempt to determine a useful model for identifying at-risk students. We then compare the models generated between 5 on-campus and 2 fully-online MOOC-style instances of the same course. The model developed achieved a 70-90\% accuracy of predicting whether a student would pass a particular problem set based on content consumed, course instance, and modality.</description>

      <title>Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Preference-based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image generative models have recently attracted considerable interest, enabling the synthesis of high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these models often lack the capability to generate specific subjects from given reference images or to synthesize novel renditions under varying conditions. Methods like DreamBooth and Subject-driven Text-to-Image (SuTI) have made significant progress in this area. Yet, both approaches primarily focus on enhancing similarity to reference images and require expensive setups, often overlooking the need for efficient training and avoiding overfitting to the reference images. In this work, we present the $\lambda$-Harmonic reward function, which provides a reliable reward signal and enables early stopping for faster training and effective regularization. By combining the Bradley-Terry preference model, the $\lambda$-Harmonic reward function also provides preference labels for subject-driven generation tasks. We propose Reward Preference Optimization (RPO), which offers a simpler setup (requiring only $3\%$ of the negative samples used by DreamBooth) and fewer gradient steps for fine-tuning. Unlike most existing methods, our approach does not require training a text encoder or optimizing text embeddings and achieves text-image alignment by fine-tuning only the U-Net component. Empirically, $\lambda$-Harmonic proves to be a reliable approach for model selection in subject-driven generation tasks. Based on preference labels and early stopping validation from the $\lambda$-Harmonic reward function, our algorithm achieves a state-of-the-art CLIP-I score of 0.833 and a CLIP-T score of 0.314 on DreamBench.</description>

      <title>Building AI Agents for Autonomous Clouds: Challenges and Design Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth in the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI Agents as part of software development and deployment is revolutionizing the information technology landscape. While code generation receives significant attention, a higher-impact application lies in using AI agents for operational resilience of cloud services, which currently require significant human effort and domain knowledge. There is a growing interest in AI for IT Operations (AIOps) which aims to automate complex operational tasks, like fault localization and root cause analysis, thereby reducing human intervention and customer impact. However, achieving the vision of autonomous and self-healing clouds though AIOps is hampered by the lack of standardized frameworks for building, evaluating, and improving AIOps agents. This vision paper lays the groundwork for such a framework by first framing the requirements and then discussing design decisions that satisfy them. We also propose AIOpsLab, a prototype implementation leveraging agent-cloud-interface that orchestrates an application, injects real-time faults using chaos engineering, and interfaces with an agent to localize and resolve the faults. We report promising results and lay the groundwork to build a modular and robust framework for building, evaluating, and improving agents for autonomous clouds.</description>

      <title>Beta Sampling is All You Need: Efficient Image Generation Strategy for Diffusion Models using Stepwise Spectral Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for high-quality image synthesis, yet their iterative nature demands significant computational resources. This paper proposes an efficient time step sampling method based on an image spectral analysis of the diffusion process, aimed at optimizing the denoising process. Instead of the traditional uniform distribution-based time step sampling, we introduce a Beta distribution-like sampling technique that prioritizes critical steps in the early and late stages of the process. Our hypothesis is that certain steps exhibit significant changes in image content, while others contribute minimally. We validated our approach using Fourier transforms to measure frequency response changes at each step, revealing substantial low-frequency changes early on and high-frequency adjustments later. Experiments with ADM and Stable Diffusion demonstrated that our Beta Sampling method consistently outperforms uniform sampling, achieving better FID and IS scores, and offers competitive efficiency relative to state-of-the-art methods like AutoDiffusion. This work provides a practical framework for enhancing diffusion model efficiency by focusing computational resources on the most impactful steps, with potential for further optimization and broader application.</description>

      <title>GPT-4V Cannot Generate Radiology Reports Yet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GPT-4V's purported strong multimodal abilities raise interests in using it to automate radiology report writing, but there lacks thorough evaluations. In this work, we perform a systematic evaluation of GPT-4V in generating radiology reports on two chest X-ray report datasets: MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray. We attempt to directly generate reports using GPT-4V through different prompting strategies and find that it fails terribly in both lexical metrics and clinical efficacy metrics. To understand the low performance, we decompose the task into two steps: 1) the medical image reasoning step of predicting medical condition labels from images; and 2) the report synthesis step of generating reports from (groundtruth) conditions. We show that GPT-4V's performance in image reasoning is consistently low across different prompts. In fact, the distributions of model-predicted labels remain constant regardless of which groundtruth conditions are present on the image, suggesting that the model is not interpreting chest X-rays meaningfully. Even when given groundtruth conditions in report synthesis, its generated reports are less correct and less natural-sounding than a finetuned LLaMA-2. Altogether, our findings cast doubt on the viability of using GPT-4V in a radiology workflow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sequential decision-making agent balances between exploring to gain new knowledge about an environment and exploiting current knowledge to maximize immediate reward. For environments studied in the traditional literature, optimal decisions gravitate over time toward exploitation as the agent accumulates sufficient knowledge and the benefits of further exploration vanish. What if, however, the environment offers an unlimited amount of useful knowledge and there is large benefit to further exploration no matter how much the agent has learned? We offer a simple, quintessential example of such a complex environment. In this environment, rewards are unbounded and an agent can always increase the rate at which rewards accumulate by exploring to learn more. Consequently, an optimal agent forever maintains a propensity to explore.</description>

      <title>Satisficing Exploration for Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A default assumption in the design of reinforcement-learning algorithms is that a decision-making agent always explores to learn optimal behavior. In sufficiently complex environments that approach the vastness and scale of the real world, however, attaining optimal performance may in fact be an entirely intractable endeavor and an agent may seldom find itself in a position to complete the requisite exploration for identifying an optimal policy. Recent work has leveraged tools from information theory to design agents that deliberately forgo optimal solutions in favor of sufficiently-satisfying or satisficing solutions, obtained through lossy compression. Notably, such agents may employ fundamentally different exploratory decisions to learn satisficing behaviors more efficiently than optimal ones that are more data intensive. While supported by a rigorous corroborating theory, the underlying algorithm relies on model-based planning, drastically limiting the compatibility of these ideas with function approximation and high-dimensional observations. In this work, we remedy this issue by extending an agent that directly represents uncertainty over the optimal value function allowing it to both bypass the need for model-based planning and to learn satisficing policies. We provide simple yet illustrative experiments that demonstrate how our algorithm enables deep reinforcement-learning agents to achieve satisficing behaviors. In keeping with previous work on this setting for multi-armed bandits, we additionally find that our algorithm is capable of synthesizing optimal behaviors, when feasible, more efficiently than its non-information-theoretic counterpart.</description>

      <title>Towards Interpretable Visuo-Tactile Predictive Models for Soft Robot Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous systems face the intricate challenge of navigating unpredictable environments and interacting with external objects. The successful integration of robotic agents into real-world situations hinges on their perception capabilities, which involve amalgamating world models and predictive skills. Effective perception models build upon the fusion of various sensory modalities to probe the surroundings. Deep learning applied to raw sensory modalities offers a viable option. However, learning-based perceptive representations become difficult to interpret. This challenge is particularly pronounced in soft robots, where the compliance of structures and materials makes prediction even harder. Our work addresses this complexity by harnessing a generative model to construct a multi-modal perception model for soft robots and to leverage proprioceptive and visual information to anticipate and interpret contact interactions with external objects. A suite of tools to interpret the perception model is furnished, shedding light on the fusion and prediction processes across multiple sensory inputs after the learning phase. We will delve into the outlooks of the perception model and its implications for control purposes.</description>

      <title>This Probably Looks Exactly Like That: An Invertible Prototypical Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine concept-based neural networks with generative, flow-based classifiers into a novel, intrinsically explainable, exactly invertible approach to supervised learning. Prototypical neural networks, a type of concept-based neural network, represent an exciting way forward in realizing human-comprehensible machine learning without concept annotations, but a human-machine semantic gap continues to haunt current approaches. We find that reliance on indirect interpretation functions for prototypical explanations imposes a severe limit on prototypes' informative power. From this, we posit that invertibly learning prototypes as distributions over the latent space provides more robust, expressive, and interpretable modeling. We propose one such model, called ProtoFlow, by composing a normalizing flow with Gaussian mixture models. ProtoFlow (1) sets a new state-of-the-art in joint generative and predictive modeling and (2) achieves predictive performance comparable to existing prototypical neural networks while enabling richer interpretation.</description>

      <title>Conditional Quantile Estimation for Uncertain Watch Time in Short-Video Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the domain of short video recommendation, predicting users' watch time is a critical but challenging task. Prevailing deterministic solutions obtain accurate debiased statistical models, yet they neglect the intrinsic uncertainty inherent in user environments. In our observation, we found that this uncertainty could potentially limit these methods' accuracy in watch-time prediction on our online platform, despite that we have employed numerous features and complex network architectures. Consequently, we believe that a better solution is to model the conditional distribution of this uncertain watch time.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel estimation technique -- Conditional Quantile Estimation (CQE), which utilizes quantile regression to capture the nuanced distribution of watch time. The learned distribution accounts for the stochastic nature of users, thereby it provides a more accurate and robust estimation. In addition, we also design several strategies to enhance the quantile prediction including conditional expectation, conservative estimation, and dynamic quantile combination. We verify the effectiveness of our method through extensive offline evaluations using public datasets as well as deployment in a real-world video application with over 300 million daily active users.</description>

      <title>Laugh Now Cry Later: Controlling Time-Varying Emotional States of Flow-Matching-Based Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: People change their tones of voice, often accompanied by nonverbal vocalizations (NVs) such as laughter and cries, to convey rich emotions. However, most text-to-speech (TTS) systems lack the capability to generate speech with rich emotions, including NVs. This paper introduces EmoCtrl-TTS, an emotion-controllable zero-shot TTS that can generate highly emotional speech with NVs for any speaker. EmoCtrl-TTS leverages arousal and valence values, as well as laughter embeddings, to condition the flow-matching-based zero-shot TTS. To achieve high-quality emotional speech generation, EmoCtrl-TTS is trained using more than 27,000 hours of expressive data curated based on pseudo-labeling. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that EmoCtrl-TTS excels in mimicking the emotions of audio prompts in speech-to-speech translation scenarios. We also show that EmoCtrl-TTS can capture emotion changes, express strong emotions, and generate various NVs in zero-shot TTS. See https://aka.ms/emoctrl-tts for demo samples.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Reranking for Knowledge-Intensive Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge-intensive visual question answering requires models to effectively use external knowledge to help answer visual questions. A typical pipeline includes a knowledge retriever and an answer generator. However, a retriever that utilizes local information, such as an image patch, may not provide reliable question-candidate relevance scores. Besides, the two-tower architecture also limits the relevance score modeling of a retriever to select top candidates for answer generator reasoning. In this paper, we introduce an additional module, a multi-modal reranker, to improve the ranking quality of knowledge candidates for answer generation. Our reranking module takes multi-modal information from both candidates and questions and performs cross-item interaction for better relevance score modeling. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA show that multi-modal reranker from distant supervision provides consistent improvements. We also find a training-testing discrepancy with reranking in answer generation, where performance improves if training knowledge candidates are similar to or noisier than those used in testing.</description>

      <title>Turning Generative Models Degenerate: The Power of Data Poisoning Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) trained by third parties raises significant security concerns. In particular, malicious actors can introduce backdoors through poisoning attacks to generate undesirable outputs. While such attacks have been extensively studied in image domains and classification tasks, they remain underexplored for natural language generation (NLG) tasks. To address this gap, we conduct an investigation of various poisoning techniques targeting the LLM's fine-tuning phase via prefix-tuning, a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method. We assess their effectiveness across two generative tasks: text summarization and text completion; and we also introduce new metrics to quantify the success and stealthiness of such NLG poisoning attacks. Through our experiments, we find that the prefix-tuning hyperparameters and trigger designs are the most crucial factors to influence attack success and stealthiness. Moreover, we demonstrate that existing popular defenses are ineffective against our poisoning attacks. Our study presents the first systematic approach to understanding poisoning attacks targeting NLG tasks during fine-tuning via PEFT across a wide range of triggers and attack settings. We hope our findings will aid the AI security community in developing effective defenses against such threats.</description>

      <title>Chip Placement with Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Macro placement is a vital step in digital circuit design that defines the physical location of large collections of components, known as macros, on a 2-dimensional chip. The physical layout obtained during placement determines key performance metrics of the chip, such as power consumption, area, and performance. Existing learning-based methods typically fall short because of their reliance on reinforcement learning, which is slow and limits the flexibility of the agent by casting placement as a sequential process. Instead, we use a powerful diffusion model to place all components simultaneously. To enable such models to train at scale, we propose a novel architecture for the denoising model, as well as an algorithm to generate large synthetic datasets for pre-training. We empirically show that our model can tackle the placement task, and achieve competitive performance on placement benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The staggering progress of machine learning in the past decade has been a sight to behold. In retrospect, it is both remarkable and unsettling that these milestones were achievable with little to no rigorous theory to guide experimentation. Despite this fact, practitioners have been able to guide their future experimentation via observations from previous large-scale empirical investigations. However, alluding to Plato's Allegory of the cave, it is likely that the observations which form the field's notion of reality are but shadows representing fragments of that reality. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework which attempts to answer what exists outside of the cave. To the theorist, we provide a framework which is mathematically rigorous and leaves open many interesting ideas for future exploration. To the practitioner, we provide a framework whose results are very intuitive, general, and which will help form principles to guide future investigations. Concretely, we provide a theoretical framework rooted in Bayesian statistics and Shannon's information theory which is general enough to unify the analysis of many phenomena in machine learning. Our framework characterizes the performance of an optimal Bayesian learner, which considers the fundamental limits of information. Throughout this work, we derive very general theoretical results and apply them to derive insights specific to settings ranging from data which is independently and identically distributed under an unknown distribution, to data which is sequential, to data which exhibits hierarchical structure amenable to meta-learning. We conclude with a section dedicated to characterizing the performance of misspecified algorithms. These results are exciting and particularly relevant as we strive to overcome increasingly difficult machine learning challenges in this endlessly complex world.</description>

      <title>Any Target Can be Offense: Adversarial Example Generation via Generalized Latent Infection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Targeted adversarial attack, which aims to mislead a model to recognize any image as a target object by imperceptible perturbations, has become a mainstream tool for vulnerability assessment of deep neural networks (DNNs). Since existing targeted attackers only learn to attack known target classes, they cannot generalize well to unknown classes. To tackle this issue, we propose $\bf{G}$eneralized $\bf{A}$dversarial attac$\bf{KER}$ ($\bf{GAKer}$), which is able to construct adversarial examples to any target class. The core idea behind GAKer is to craft a latently infected representation during adversarial example generation. To this end, the extracted latent representations of the target object are first injected into intermediate features of an input image in an adversarial generator. Then, the generator is optimized to ensure visual consistency with the input image while being close to the target object in the feature space. Since the GAKer is class-agnostic yet model-agnostic, it can be regarded as a general tool that not only reveals the vulnerability of more DNNs but also identifies deficiencies of DNNs in a wider range of classes. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method in generating adversarial examples for both known and unknown classes. Notably, compared with other generative methods, our method achieves an approximately $14.13\%$ higher attack success rate for unknown classes and an approximately $4.23\%$ higher success rate for known classes. Our code is available in https://github.com/VL-Group/GAKer.</description>

      <title>ModalChorus: Visual Probing and Alignment of Multi-modal Embeddings via Modal Fusion Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal embeddings form the foundation for vision-language models, such as CLIP embeddings, the most widely used text-image embeddings. However, these embeddings are vulnerable to subtle misalignment of cross-modal features, resulting in decreased model performance and diminished generalization. To address this problem, we design ModalChorus, an interactive system for visual probing and alignment of multi-modal embeddings. ModalChorus primarily offers a two-stage process: 1) embedding probing with Modal Fusion Map (MFM), a novel parametric dimensionality reduction method that integrates both metric and nonmetric objectives to enhance modality fusion; and 2) embedding alignment that allows users to interactively articulate intentions for both point-set and set-set alignments. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons for CLIP embeddings with existing dimensionality reduction (e.g., t-SNE and MDS) and data fusion (e.g., data context map) methods demonstrate the advantages of MFM in showcasing cross-modal features over common vision-language datasets. Case studies reveal that ModalChorus can facilitate intuitive discovery of misalignment and efficient re-alignment in scenarios ranging from zero-shot classification to cross-modal retrieval and generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-training quantization is the leading method for addressing memory-related bottlenecks in LLM inference, but unfortunately, it suffers from significant performance degradation below 4-bit precision. An alternative approach involves training compressed models directly at a low bitwidth (e.g., binary or ternary models). However, the performance, training dynamics, and scaling trends of such models are not yet well understood. To address this issue, we train and openly release the Spectra LLM suite consisting of 54 language models ranging from 99M to 3.9B parameters, trained on 300B tokens. Spectra includes FloatLMs, post-training quantized QuantLMs (3, 4, 6, and 8 bits), and ternary LLMs (TriLMs) - our improved architecture for ternary language modeling, which significantly outperforms previously proposed ternary models of a given size (in bits), matching half-precision models at scale. For example, TriLM 3.9B is (bit-wise) smaller than the half-precision FloatLM 830M, but matches half-precision FloatLM 3.9B in commonsense reasoning and knowledge benchmarks. However, TriLM 3.9B is also as toxic and stereotyping as FloatLM 3.9B, a model six times larger in size. Additionally, TriLM 3.9B lags behind FloatLM in perplexity on validation splits and web-based corpora but performs better on less noisy datasets like Lambada and PennTreeBank.
  To enhance understanding of low-bitwidth models, we are releasing 500+ intermediate checkpoints of the Spectra suite at \href{https://github.com/NolanoOrg/SpectraSuite}{https://github.com/NolanoOrg/SpectraSuite}.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Calibration with Energy Based Instance-wise Scaling in the Wild Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement in the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs), there has been significant interest in deploying and incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) systems into real-world scenarios. However, many DNNs lack the ability to represent uncertainty, often exhibiting excessive confidence even when making incorrect predictions. To ensure the reliability of AI systems, particularly in safety-critical cases, DNNs should transparently reflect the uncertainty in their predictions. In this paper, we investigate robust post-hoc uncertainty calibration methods for DNNs within the context of multi-class classification tasks. While previous studies have made notable progress, they still face challenges in achieving robust calibration, particularly in scenarios involving out-of-distribution (OOD). We identify that previous methods lack adaptability to individual input data and struggle to accurately estimate uncertainty when processing inputs drawn from the wild dataset. To address this issue, we introduce a novel instance-wise calibration method based on an energy model. Our method incorporates energy scores instead of softmax confidence scores, allowing for adaptive consideration of DNN uncertainty for each prediction within a logit space. In experiments, we show that the proposed method consistently maintains robust performance across the spectrum, spanning from in-distribution to OOD scenarios, when compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>I2AM: Interpreting Image-to-Image Latent Diffusion Models via Attribution Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale diffusion models have made significant advancements in the field of image generation, especially through the use of cross-attention mechanisms that guide image formation based on textual descriptions. While the analysis of text-guided cross-attention in diffusion models has been extensively studied in recent years, its application in image-to-image diffusion models remains underexplored. This paper introduces the Image-to-Image Attribution Maps I2AM method, which aggregates patch-level cross-attention scores to enhance the interpretability of latent diffusion models across time steps, heads, and attention layers. I2AM facilitates detailed image-to-image attribution analysis, enabling observation of how diffusion models prioritize key features over time and head during the image generation process from reference images. Through extensive experiments, we first visualize the attribution maps of both generated and reference images, verifying that critical information from the reference image is effectively incorporated into the generated image, and vice versa. To further assess our understanding, we introduce a new evaluation metric tailored for reference-based image inpainting tasks. This metric, measuring the consistency between the attribution maps of generated and reference images, shows a strong correlation with established performance metrics for inpainting tasks, validating the potential use of I2AM in future research endeavors.</description>

      <title>GUME: Graphs and User Modalities Enhancement for Long-Tail Multimodal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal recommendation systems (MMRS) have received considerable attention from the research community due to their ability to jointly utilize information from user behavior and product images and text. Previous research has two main issues. First, many long-tail items in recommendation systems have limited interaction data, making it difficult to learn comprehensive and informative representations. However, past MMRS studies have overlooked this issue. Secondly, users' modality preferences are crucial to their behavior. However, previous research has primarily focused on learning item modality representations, while user modality representations have remained relatively simplistic.To address these challenges, we propose a novel Graphs and User Modalities Enhancement (GUME) for long-tail multimodal recommendation. Specifically, we first enhance the user-item graph using multimodal similarity between items. This improves the connectivity of long-tail items and helps them learn high-quality representations through graph propagation. Then, we construct two types of user modalities: explicit interaction features and extended interest features. By using the user modality enhancement strategy to maximize mutual information between these two features, we improve the generalization ability of user modality representations. Additionally, we design an alignment strategy for modality data to remove noise from both internal and external perspectives. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>SENTAUR: Security EnhaNced Trojan Assessment Using LLMs Against Undesirable Revisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A globally distributed IC supply chain brings risks due to untrusted third parties. The risks span inadvertent use of hardware Trojan (HT), inserted Intellectual Property (3P-IP) or Electronic Design Automation (EDA) flows. HT can introduce stealthy HT behavior, prevent an IC work as intended, or leak sensitive data via side channels. To counter HTs, rapidly examining HT scenarios is a key requirement. While Trust-Hub benchmarks are a good starting point to assess defenses, they encompass a small subset of manually created HTs within the expanse of HT designs. Further, the HTs may disappear during synthesis. We propose a large language model (LLM) framework SENTAUR to generate a suite of legitimate HTs for a Register Transfer Level (RTL) design by learning its specifications, descriptions, and natural language descriptions of HT effects. Existing tools and benchmarks are limited; they need a learning period to construct an ML model to mimic the threat model and are difficult to reproduce. SENTAUR can swiftly produce HT instances by leveraging LLMs without any learning period and sanitizing the HTs facilitating their rapid assessment. Evaluation of SENTAUR involved generating effective, synthesizable, and practical HTs from TrustHub and elsewhere, investigating impacts of payloads/triggers at the RTL. While our evaluation focused on HT insertion, SENTAUR can generalize to automatically transform an RTL code to have defined functional modifications.</description>

      <title>NavGPT-2: Unleashing Navigational Reasoning Capability for Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capitalizing on the remarkable advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a burgeoning initiative to harness LLMs for instruction following robotic navigation. Such a trend underscores the potential of LLMs to generalize navigational reasoning and diverse language understanding. However, a significant discrepancy in agent performance is observed when integrating LLMs in the Vision-and-Language navigation (VLN) tasks compared to previous downstream specialist models. Furthermore, the inherent capacity of language to interpret and facilitate communication in agent interactions is often underutilized in these integrations. In this work, we strive to bridge the divide between VLN-specialized models and LLM-based navigation paradigms, while maintaining the interpretative prowess of LLMs in generating linguistic navigational reasoning. By aligning visual content in a frozen LLM, we encompass visual observation comprehension for LLMs and exploit a way to incorporate LLMs and navigation policy networks for effective action predictions and navigational reasoning. We demonstrate the data efficiency of the proposed methods and eliminate the gap between LM-based agents and state-of-the-art VLN specialists.</description>

      <title>HIMO: A New Benchmark for Full-Body Human Interacting with Multiple Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating human-object interactions (HOIs) is critical with the tremendous advances of digital avatars. Existing datasets are typically limited to humans interacting with a single object while neglecting the ubiquitous manipulation of multiple objects. Thus, we propose HIMO, a large-scale MoCap dataset of full-body human interacting with multiple objects, containing 3.3K 4D HOI sequences and 4.08M 3D HOI frames. We also annotate HIMO with detailed textual descriptions and temporal segments, benchmarking two novel tasks of HOI synthesis conditioned on either the whole text prompt or the segmented text prompts as fine-grained timeline control. To address these novel tasks, we propose a dual-branch conditional diffusion model with a mutual interaction module for HOI synthesis. Besides, an auto-regressive generation pipeline is also designed to obtain smooth transitions between HOI segments. Experimental results demonstrate the generalization ability to unseen object geometries and temporal compositions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) extends conventional recommender systems by leveraging user-item interactions from dense domains to mitigate data sparsity and the cold start problem. While CDR offers substantial potential for enhancing recommendation performance, most existing CDR methods suffer from sensitivity to the ratio of overlapping users and intrinsic discrepancy between source and target domains. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we explore the application of graph signal processing (GSP) in CDR scenarios. We propose CGSP, a unified CDR framework based on GSP, which employs a cross-domain similarity graph constructed by flexibly combining target-only similarity and source-bridged similarity. By processing personalized graph signals computed for users from either the source or target domain, our framework effectively supports both inter-domain and intra-domain recommendations. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that CGSP consistently outperforms various encoder-based CDR approaches in both intra-domain and inter-domain recommendation scenarios, especially when the ratio of overlapping users is low, highlighting its significant practical implication in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>StoX-Net: Stochastic Processing of Partial Sums for Efficient In-Memory Computing DNN Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crossbar-based in-memory computing (IMC) has emerged as a promising platform for hardware acceleration of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the energy and latency of IMC systems are dominated by the large overhead of the peripheral analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). To address such ADC bottleneck, here we propose to implement stochastic processing of array-level partial sums (PS) for efficient IMC. Leveraging the probabilistic switching of spin-orbit torque magnetic tunnel junctions, the proposed PS processing eliminates the costly ADC, achieving significant improvement in energy and area efficiency. To mitigate accuracy loss, we develop PS-quantization-aware training that enables backward propagation across stochastic PS. Furthermore, a novel scheme with an inhomogeneous sampling length of the stochastic conversion is proposed. When running ResNet20 on the CIFAR-10 dataset, our architecture-to-algorithm co-design demonstrates up to 22x, 30x, and 142x improvement in energy, latency, and area, respectively, compared to IMC with standard ADC. Our optimized design configuration using stochastic PS achieved 666x (111x) improvement in Energy-Delay-Product compared to IMC with full precision ADC (sparse low-bit ADC), while maintaining near-software accuracy at various benchmark classification tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models exhibit aspects of human-level intelligence that catalyze their application as human-like agents in domains such as social simulations, human-machine interactions, and collaborative multi-agent systems. However, the absence of distinct personalities, such as displaying ingratiating behaviors, inconsistent opinions, and uniform response patterns, diminish LLMs utility in practical applications. Addressing this, the development of personality traits in LLMs emerges as a crucial area of research to unlock their latent potential. Existing methods to personify LLMs generally involve strategies like employing stylized training data for instruction tuning or using prompt engineering to simulate different personalities. These methods only capture superficial linguistic styles instead of the core of personalities and are therefore not stable. In this study, we propose PersLLM, integrating psychology-grounded principles of personality: social practice, consistency, and dynamic development, into a comprehensive training methodology. We incorporate personality traits directly into the model parameters, enhancing the model's resistance to induction, promoting consistency, and supporting the dynamic evolution of personality. Single-agent evaluation validates our method's superiority, as it produces responses more aligned with reference personalities compared to other approaches. Case studies for multi-agent communication highlight its benefits in enhancing opinion consistency within individual agents and fostering collaborative creativity among multiple agents in dialogue contexts, potentially benefiting human simulation and multi-agent cooperation. Additionally, human-agent interaction evaluations indicate that our personified models significantly enhance interactive experiences, underscoring the practical implications of our research.</description>

      <title>Mamba-PTQ: Outlier Channels in Recurrent Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern recurrent layers are emerging as a promising path toward edge deployment of foundation models, especially in the context of large language models (LLMs). Compressing the whole input sequence in a finite-dimensional representation enables recurrent layers to model long-range dependencies while maintaining a constant inference cost for each token and a fixed memory requirement. However, the practical deployment of LLMs in resource-limited environments often requires further model compression, such as quantization and pruning. While these techniques are well-established for attention-based models, their effects on recurrent layers remain underexplored.
  In this preliminary work, we focus on post-training quantization for recurrent LLMs and show that Mamba models exhibit the same pattern of outlier channels observed in attention-based LLMs. We show that the reason for the difficulty of quantizing SSMs is caused by activation outliers, similar to those observed in transformer-based LLMs. We report baseline results for post-training quantization of Mamba that do not take into account the activation outliers and suggest first steps for outlier-aware quantization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent advancements in machine learning, federated learning allows a network of distributed clients to collaboratively develop a global model without needing to share their local data. This technique aims to safeguard privacy, countering the vulnerabilities of conventional centralized learning methods. Traditional federated learning approaches often rely on a central server to coordinate model training across clients, aiming to replicate the same model uniformly across all nodes. However, these methods overlook the significance of geographical and local data variances in vast networks, potentially affecting model effectiveness and applicability. Moreover, relying on a central server might become a bottleneck in large networks, such as the ones promoted by edge computing. Our paper introduces a novel, fully-distributed federated learning strategy called proximity-based self-federated learning that enables the self-organised creation of multiple federations of clients based on their geographic proximity and data distribution without exchanging raw data. Indeed, unlike traditional algorithms, our approach encourages clients to share and adjust their models with neighbouring nodes based on geographic proximity and model accuracy. This method not only addresses the limitations posed by diverse data distributions but also enhances the model's adaptability to different regional characteristics creating specialized models for each federation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulations on well-known datasets, showcasing its effectiveness over the conventional centralized federated learning framework.</description>

      <title>Improving the classification of extreme classes by means of loss regularisation and generalised beta distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ordinal classification problem is one in which the target variable takes values on an ordinal scale. Nowadays, there are many of these problems associated with real-world tasks where it is crucial to accurately classify the extreme classes of the ordinal structure. In this work, we propose a unimodal regularisation approach that can be applied to any loss function to improve the classification performance of the first and last classes while maintaining good performance for the remainder. The proposed methodology is tested on six datasets with different numbers of classes, and compared with other unimodal regularisation methods in the literature. In addition, performance in the extreme classes is compared using a new metric that takes into account their sensitivities. Experimental results and statistical analysis show that the proposed methodology obtains a superior average performance considering different metrics. The results for the proposed metric show that the generalised beta distribution generally improves classification performance in the extreme classes. At the same time, the other five nominal and ordinal metrics considered show that the overall performance is aligned with the performance of previous alternatives.</description>

Abstract: Power grids are critical infrastructures of paramount importance to modern society and their rapid evolution and interconnections has heightened the complexity of power systems (PS) operations. Traditional methods for grid analysis struggle with the computational demands of large-scale RES and ES integration, prompting the adoption of machine learning (ML) techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs have proven effective in solving the alternating current (AC) Power Flow (PF) and Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems, crucial for operational planning. However, existing benchmarks and datasets completely ignore safety and robustness requirements in their evaluation and never consider realistic safety-critical scenarios that most impact the operations of the power grids. We present SafePowerGraph, the first simulator-agnostic, safety-oriented framework and benchmark for GNNs in PS operations. SafePowerGraph integrates multiple PF and OPF simulators and assesses GNN performance under diverse scenarios, including energy price variations and power line outages. Our extensive experiments underscore the importance of self-supervised learning and graph attention architectures for GNN robustness. We provide at https://github.com/yamizi/SafePowerGraph our open-source repository, a comprehensive leaderboard, a dataset and model zoo and expect our framework to standardize and advance research in the critical field of GNN for power systems.</description>

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially ChatGPT, into education is poised to revolutionize students' learning experiences by introducing innovative conversational learning methodologies. To empower students to fully leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT in educational scenarios, understanding students' interaction patterns with ChatGPT is crucial for instructors. However, this endeavor is challenging due to the absence of datasets focused on student-ChatGPT conversations and the complexities in identifying and analyzing the evolutional interaction patterns within conversations. To address these challenges, we collected conversational data from 48 students interacting with ChatGPT in a master's level data visualization course over one semester. We then developed a coding scheme, grounded in the literature on cognitive levels and thematic analysis, to categorize students' interaction patterns with ChatGPT. Furthermore, we present a visual analytics system, StuGPTViz, that tracks and compares temporal patterns in student prompts and the quality of ChatGPT's responses at multiple scales, revealing significant pedagogical insights for instructors. We validated the system's effectiveness through expert interviews with six data visualization instructors and three case studies. The results confirmed StuGPTViz's capacity to enhance educators' insights into the pedagogical value of ChatGPT. We also discussed the potential research opportunities of applying visual analytics in education and developing AI-driven personalized learning solutions.</description>

      <title>Sharif-STR at SemEval-2024 Task 1: Transformer as a Regression Model for Fine-Grained Scoring of Textual Semantic Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic Textual Relatedness holds significant relevance in Natural Language Processing, finding applications across various domains. Traditionally, approaches to STR have relied on knowledge-based and statistical methods. However, with the emergence of Large Language Models, there has been a paradigm shift, ushering in new methodologies. In this paper, we delve into the investigation of sentence-level STR within Track A (Supervised) by leveraging fine-tuning techniques on the RoBERTa transformer. Our study focuses on assessing the efficacy of this approach across different languages. Notably, our findings indicate promising advancements in STR performance, particularly in Latin languages. Specifically, our results demonstrate notable improvements in English, achieving a correlation of 0.82 and securing a commendable 19th rank. Similarly, in Spanish, we achieved a correlation of 0.67, securing the 15th position. However, our approach encounters challenges in languages like Arabic, where we observed a correlation of only 0.38, resulting in a 20th rank.</description>

      <title>Variable-Agnostic Causal Exploration for Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) struggles to capture real-world cause-and-effect dynamics, leading to inefficient exploration due to extensive trial-and-error actions. While recent efforts to improve agent exploration have leveraged causal discovery, they often make unrealistic assumptions of causal variables in the environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, Variable-Agnostic Causal Exploration for Reinforcement Learning (VACERL), incorporating causal relationships to drive exploration in RL without specifying environmental causal variables. Our approach automatically identifies crucial observation-action steps associated with key variables using attention mechanisms. Subsequently, it constructs the causal graph connecting these steps, which guides the agent towards observation-action pairs with greater causal influence on task completion. This can be leveraged to generate intrinsic rewards or establish a hierarchy of subgoals to enhance exploration efficiency. Experimental results showcase a significant improvement in agent performance in grid-world, 2d games and robotic domains, particularly in scenarios with sparse rewards and noisy actions, such as the notorious Noisy-TV environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the substantial progress in deep learning, its adoption in industrial robotics projects remains limited, primarily due to challenges in data acquisition and labeling. Previous sim2real approaches using domain randomization require extensive scene and model optimization. To address these issues, we introduce an innovative physically-based structured light simulation system, generating both RGB and physically realistic depth images, surpassing previous dataset generation tools. We create an RGBD dataset tailored for robotic industrial grasping scenarios and evaluate it across various tasks, including object detection, instance segmentation, and embedding sim2real visual perception in industrial robotic grasping. By reducing the sim2real gap and enhancing deep learning training, we facilitate the application of deep learning models in industrial settings.

      <title>Search Engines, LLMs or Both? Evaluating Information Seeking Strategies for Answering Health Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Search engines have traditionally served as primary tools for information seeking. However, the new Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multiple tasks and, specifically, their adoption as question answering systems is becoming increasingly prevalent. It is expected that LLM-based conversational systems and traditional web engines will continue to coexist in the future, supporting end users in various ways. But there is a need for more scientific research on the effectiveness of both types of systems in facilitating accurate information seeking. In this study, we focus on their merits in answering health questions. We conducted an extensive study comparing different web search engines, LLMs and retrieval-augmented (RAG) approaches. Our research reveals intriguing conclusions. For example, we observed that the quality of webpages potentially responding to a health question does not decline as we navigate further down the ranked lists. However, according to our evaluation, web engines are less accurate than LLMs in finding correct answers to health questions. On the other hand, LLMs are quite sensitive to the input prompts, and we also found out that RAG leads to highly effective information seeking methods.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Adaptation with State-Space Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distribution shifts between training and test data are all but inevitable over the lifecycle of a deployed model and lead to performance decay. Adapting the model can hopefully mitigate this drop in performance. Yet, adaptation is challenging since it must be unsupervised: we usually do not have access to any labeled data at test time. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic state-space model that can adapt a deployed model subjected to distribution drift. Our model learns the dynamics induced by distribution shifts on the last set of hidden features. Without requiring labels, we infer time-evolving class prototypes that serve as a dynamic classification head. Moreover, our approach is lightweight, modifying only the model's last linear layer. In experiments on real-world distribution shifts and synthetic corruptions, we demonstrate that our approach performs competitively with methods that require back-propagation and access to the model backbone. Our model especially excels in the case of small test batches - the most difficult setting.</description>

      <title>Subequivariant Reinforcement Learning in 3D Multi-Entity Physical Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning policies for multi-entity systems in 3D environments is far more complicated against single-entity scenarios, due to the exponential expansion of the global state space as the number of entities increases. One potential solution of alleviating the exponential complexity is dividing the global space into independent local views that are invariant to transformations including translations and rotations. To this end, this paper proposes Subequivariant Hierarchical Neural Networks (SHNN) to facilitate multi-entity policy learning. In particular, SHNN first dynamically decouples the global space into local entity-level graphs via task assignment. Second, it leverages subequivariant message passing over the local entity-level graphs to devise local reference frames, remarkably compressing the representation redundancy, particularly in gravity-affected environments. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of existing benchmarks in capturing the subtleties of multi-entity systems under the Euclidean symmetry, we propose the Multi-entity Benchmark (MEBEN), a new suite of environments tailored for exploring a wide range of multi-entity reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant advancements of SHNN on the proposed benchmarks compared to existing methods. Comprehensive ablations are conducted to verify the indispensability of task assignment and subequivariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of multimedia content has made accurately retrieving relevant videos from large collections increasingly challenging. Recent advancements in text-video retrieval have focused on cross-modal interactions, large-scale foundation model training, and probabilistic modeling, yet often neglect the crucial user perspective, leading to discrepancies between user queries and the content retrieved. To address this, we introduce MERLIN (Multimodal Embedding Refinement via LLM-based Iterative Navigation), a novel, training-free pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for iterative feedback learning. MERLIN refines query embeddings from a user perspective, enhancing alignment between queries and video content through a dynamic question answering process. Experimental results on datasets like MSR-VTT, MSVD, and ActivityNet demonstrate that MERLIN substantially improves Recall@1, outperforming existing systems and confirming the benefits of integrating LLMs into multimodal retrieval systems for more responsive and context-aware multimedia retrieval.</description>

      <title>Online Pseudo-Zeroth-Order Training of Neuromorphic Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-inspired neuromorphic computing with spiking neural networks (SNNs) is a promising energy-efficient computational approach. However, successfully training SNNs in a more biologically plausible and neuromorphic-hardware-friendly way is still challenging. Most recent methods leverage spatial and temporal backpropagation (BP), not adhering to neuromorphic properties. Despite the efforts of some online training methods, tackling spatial credit assignments by alternatives with comparable performance as spatial BP remains a significant problem. In this work, we propose a novel method, online pseudo-zeroth-order (OPZO) training. Our method only requires a single forward propagation with noise injection and direct top-down signals for spatial credit assignment, avoiding spatial BP's problem of symmetric weights and separate phases for layer-by-layer forward-backward propagation. OPZO solves the large variance problem of zeroth-order methods by the pseudo-zeroth-order formulation and momentum feedback connections, while having more guarantees than random feedback. Combining online training, OPZO can pave paths to on-chip SNN training. Experiments on neuromorphic and static datasets with fully connected and convolutional networks demonstrate the effectiveness of OPZO with similar performance compared with spatial BP, as well as estimated low training costs.</description>

      <title>Struct-X: Enhancing Large Language Models Reasoning with Structured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structured data, rich in logical and relational information, has the potential to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Still, its integration poses a challenge due to the risk of overwhelming LLMs with excessive tokens and irrelevant context information. To address this, we propose Struct-X, a novel framework that operates through five key phases: ``read-model-fill-reflect-reason'' efficiently enabling LLMs to utilize structured data. It begins by encoding structured data into a topological space using graph embeddings, followed by filling in missing entity information with knowledge retrieval modules, and filtering out irrelevant tokens via a self-supervised module. The final phase involves constructing a topological network with selected tokens to further reduce the total token length for more effective LLM inference. Additionally, Struct-X includes an Auxiliary Module trained to generate prompts, aiding LLMs in analyzing structured data. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, including the knowledge graph question-answer task and the long document reading comprehension task, show that Struct-X notably improves LLM reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of structured data augmentation in improving LLM inference with complex input context.</description>

      <title>Towards Collaborative Intelligence: Propagating Intentions and Reasoning for Multi-Agent Coordination with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective collaboration in multi-agent systems requires communicating goals and intentions between agents. Current agent frameworks often suffer from dependencies on single-agent execution and lack robust inter-module communication, frequently leading to suboptimal multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) policies and inadequate task coordination. To address these challenges, we present a framework for training large language models (LLMs) as collaborative agents to enable coordinated behaviors in cooperative MARL. Each agent maintains a private intention consisting of its current goal and associated sub-tasks. Agents broadcast their intentions periodically, allowing other agents to infer coordination tasks. A propagation network transforms broadcast intentions into teammate-specific communication messages, sharing relevant goals with designated teammates. The architecture of our framework is structured into planning, grounding, and execution modules. During execution, multiple agents interact in a downstream environment and communicate intentions to enable coordinated behaviors. The grounding module dynamically adapts comprehension strategies based on emerging coordination patterns, while feedback from execution agents influnces the planning module, enabling the dynamic re-planning of sub-tasks. Results in collaborative environment simulation demonstrate intention propagation reduces miscoordination errors by aligning sub-task dependencies between agents. Agents learn when to communicate intentions and which teammates require task details, resulting in emergent coordinated behaviors. This demonstrates the efficacy of intention sharing for cooperative multi-agent RL based on LLMs.</description>

      <title>Abstraction Alignment: Comparing Model and Human Conceptual Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstraction -- the process of generalizing specific examples into broad reusable patterns -- is central to how people efficiently process and store information and apply their knowledge to new data. Promisingly, research has shown that ML models learn representations that span levels of abstraction, from specific concepts like "bolo tie" and "car tire" to more general concepts like "CEO" and "model". However, existing techniques analyze these representations in isolation, treating learned concepts as independent artifacts rather than an interconnected web of abstraction. As a result, although we can identify the concepts a model uses to produce its output, it is difficult to assess if it has learned a human-aligned abstraction of the concepts that will generalize to new data. To address this gap, we introduce abstraction alignment, a methodology to measure the agreement between a model's learned abstraction and the expected human abstraction. We quantify abstraction alignment by comparing model outputs against a human abstraction graph, such as linguistic relationships or medical disease hierarchies. In evaluation tasks interpreting image models, benchmarking language models, and analyzing medical datasets, abstraction alignment provides a deeper understanding of model behavior and dataset content, differentiating errors based on their agreement with human knowledge, expanding the verbosity of current model quality metrics, and revealing ways to improve existing human abstractions.</description>

      <title>IICPilot: An Intelligent Integrated Circuit Backend Design Framework Using Open EDA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-source EDA tools are rapidly advancing, fostering collaboration, innovation, and knowledge sharing within the EDA community. However, the growing complexity of these tools, characterized by numerous design parameters and heuristics, poses a significant barrier to their widespread adoption. This complexity is particularly pronounced in integrated circuit (IC) backend designs, which place substantial demands on engineers' expertise in EDA tools. To tackle this challenge, we introduce IICPilot, an intelligent IC backend design system based on LLM technology. IICPilot automates various backend design procedures, including script generation, EDA tool invocation, design space exploration of EDA parameters, container-based computing resource allocation, and exception management. By automating these tasks, IICPilot significantly lowers the barrier to entry for open-source EDA tools. Specifically, IICPilot utilizes LangChain's multi-agent framework to efficiently handle distinct design tasks, enabling flexible enhancements independently. Moreover, IICPilot separates the backend design workflow from specific open-source EDA tools through a unified EDA calling interface. This approach allows seamless integration with different open-source EDA tools like OpenROAD and iEDA, streamlining the backend design and optimization across the EDA tools.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Unsafe Video Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video generation models (VGMs) have demonstrated the capability to synthesize high-quality output. It is important to understand their potential to produce unsafe content, such as violent or terrifying videos. In this work, we provide a comprehensive understanding of unsafe video generation.
  First, to confirm the possibility that these models could indeed generate unsafe videos, we choose unsafe content generation prompts collected from 4chan and Lexica, and three open-source SOTA VGMs to generate unsafe videos. After filtering out duplicates and poorly generated content, we created an initial set of 2112 unsafe videos from an original pool of 5607 videos. Through clustering and thematic coding analysis of these generated videos, we identify 5 unsafe video categories: Distorted/Weird, Terrifying, Pornographic, Violent/Bloody, and Political. With IRB approval, we then recruit online participants to help label the generated videos. Based on the annotations submitted by 403 participants, we identified 937 unsafe videos from the initial video set. With the labeled information and the corresponding prompts, we created the first dataset of unsafe videos generated by VGMs.
  We then study possible defense mechanisms to prevent the generation of unsafe videos. Existing defense methods in image generation focus on filtering either input prompt or output results. We propose a new approach called Latent Variable Defense (LVD), which works within the model's internal sampling process. LVD can achieve 0.90 defense accuracy while reducing time and computing resources by 10x when sampling a large number of unsafe prompts.</description>

      <title>Embracing Events and Frames with Hierarchical Feature Refinement Network for Object Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In frame-based vision, object detection faces substantial performance degradation under challenging conditions due to the limited sensing capability of conventional cameras. Event cameras output sparse and asynchronous events, providing a potential solution to solve these problems. However, effectively fusing two heterogeneous modalities remains an open issue. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical feature refinement network for event-frame fusion. The core concept is the design of the coarse-to-fine fusion module, denoted as the cross-modality adaptive feature refinement (CAFR) module. In the initial phase, the bidirectional cross-modality interaction (BCI) part facilitates information bridging from two distinct sources. Subsequently, the features are further refined by aligning the channel-level mean and variance in the two-fold adaptive feature refinement (TAFR) part. We conducted extensive experiments on two benchmarks: the low-resolution PKU-DDD17-Car dataset and the high-resolution DSEC dataset. Experimental results show that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art by an impressive margin of $\textbf{8.0}\%$ on the DSEC dataset. Besides, our method exhibits significantly better robustness (\textbf{69.5}\% versus \textbf{38.7}\%) when introducing 15 different corruption types to the frame images. The code can be found at the link (https://github.com/HuCaoFighting/FRN).</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Robust Self-Supervised Learning Across Diverse Downstream Tasks</title>

Abstract: Large-scale vision models have become integral in many applications due to their unprecedented performance and versatility across downstream tasks. However, the robustness of these foundation models has primarily been explored for a single task, namely image classification. The vulnerability of other common vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation, remains largely unknown. We present a comprehensive empirical evaluation of the adversarial robustness of self-supervised vision encoders across multiple downstream tasks. Our attacks operate in the encoder embedding space and at the downstream task output level. In both cases, current state-of-the-art adversarial fine-tuning techniques tested only for classification significantly degrade clean and robust performance on other tasks. Since the purpose of a foundation model is to cater to multiple applications at once, our findings reveal the need to enhance encoder robustness more broadly. %We discuss potential strategies for more robust foundation vision models across diverse downstream tasks. Our code is available at $\href{https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/ssl-robustness}{github.com/layer6ai-labs/ssl-robustness}$.</description>

Abstract: Diversity is a concept of prime importance in almost all disciplines based on information processing. In telecommunications, for example, spatial, temporal, and frequency diversity, as well as redundant coding, are fundamental concepts that have enabled the design of extremely efficient systems. In machine learning, in particular with neural networks, diversity is not always a concept that is emphasized or at least clearly identified. This paper proposes a neural network architecture that builds upon various diversity principles, some of them already known, others more original. Our architecture obtains remarkable results, with a record self-supervised learning accuracy of 99. 57% in MNIST, and a top tier promising semi-supervised learning accuracy of 94.21% in CIFAR-10 using only 25 labels per class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloud-edge computing requires applications to operate across diverse infrastructures, often triggered by cyber-physical events. Containers offer a lightweight deployment option but pulling images from central repositories can cause delays. This article presents a novel declarative approach and open-source prototype for replicating container images across the cloud-edge continuum. Considering resource availability, network QoS, and storage costs, we leverage logic programming to (i) determine optimal initial placements via Answer Set Programming (ASP) and (ii) adapt placements using Prolog-based continuous reasoning. We evaluate our solution through simulations, showcasing how combining ASP and Prolog continuous reasoning can balance cost optimisation and prompt decision-making in placement adaptation at increasing infrastructure sizes.</description>

      <title>Instance-wise Uncertainty for Class Imbalance in Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental computer vision task with a vast number of applications. State of the art methods increasingly rely on deep learning models, known to incorrectly estimate uncertainty and being overconfident in predictions, especially in data not seen during training. This is particularly problematic in semantic segmentation due to inherent class imbalance. Popular uncertainty quantification approaches are task-agnostic and fail to leverage spatial pixel correlations in uncertainty estimates, crucial in this task. In this work, a novel training methodology specifically designed for semantic segmentation is presented. Training samples are weighted by instance-wise uncertainty masks computed by an ensemble. This is shown to increase performance on minority classes, boost model generalization and robustness to domain-shift when compared to using the inverse of class proportions or no class weights at all. This method addresses the challenges of class imbalance and uncertainty estimation in semantic segmentation, potentially enhancing model performance and reliability across various applications.</description>

      <title>Missing Modality Prediction for Unpaired Multimodal Learning via Joint Embedding of Unimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning typically relies on the assumption that all modalities are fully available during both the training and inference phases. However, in real-world scenarios, consistently acquiring complete multimodal data presents significant challenges due to various factors. This often leads to the issue of missing modalities, where data for certain modalities are absent, posing considerable obstacles not only for the availability of multimodal pretrained models but also for their fine-tuning and the preservation of robustness in downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework integrating parameter-efficient fine-tuning of unimodal pretrained models with a self-supervised joint-embedding learning method. This framework enables the model to predict the embedding of a missing modality in the representation space during inference. Our method effectively predicts the missing embedding through prompt tuning, leveraging information from available modalities. We evaluate our approach on several multimodal benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness across various scenarios of missing modalities.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the Power of Artificial Intelligence to Vitalize Endangered Indigenous Languages: Technologies and Experiences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since 2022 we have been exploring application areas and technologies in which Artificial Intelligence (AI) and modern Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as Large Language Models (LLMs), can be employed to foster the usage and facilitate the documentation of Indigenous languages which are in danger of disappearing. We start by discussing the decreasing diversity of languages in the world and how working with Indigenous languages poses unique ethical challenges for AI and NLP. To address those challenges, we propose an alternative development AI cycle based on community engagement and usage. Then, we report encouraging results in the development of high-quality machine learning translators for Indigenous languages by fine-tuning state-of-the-art (SOTA) translators with tiny amounts of data and discuss how to avoid some common pitfalls in the process. We also present prototypes we have built in projects done in 2023 and 2024 with Indigenous communities in Brazil, aimed at facilitating writing, and discuss the development of Indigenous Language Models (ILMs) as a replicable and scalable way to create spell-checkers, next-word predictors, and similar tools. Finally, we discuss how we envision a future for language documentation where dying languages are preserved as interactive language models.</description>

      <title>A Methodology Establishing Linear Convergence of Adaptive Gradient Methods under PL Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive gradient-descent optimizers are the standard choice for training neural network models. Despite their faster convergence than gradient-descent and remarkable performance in practice, the adaptive optimizers are not as well understood as vanilla gradient-descent. A reason is that the dynamic update of the learning rate that helps in faster convergence of these methods also makes their analysis intricate. Particularly, the simple gradient-descent method converges at a linear rate for a class of optimization problems, whereas the practically faster adaptive gradient methods lack such a theoretical guarantee. The Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) inequality is the weakest known class, for which linear convergence of gradient-descent and its momentum variants has been proved. Therefore, in this paper, we prove that AdaGrad and Adam, two well-known adaptive gradient methods, converge linearly when the cost function is smooth and satisfies the PL inequality. Our theoretical framework follows a simple and unified approach, applicable to both batch and stochastic gradients, which can potentially be utilized in analyzing linear convergence of other variants of Adam.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot Text-guided Infinite Image Synthesis with LLM guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-guided image editing and generation methods have diverse real-world applications. However, text-guided infinite image synthesis faces several challenges. First, there is a lack of text-image paired datasets with high-resolution and contextual diversity. Second, expanding images based on text requires global coherence and rich local context understanding. Previous studies have mainly focused on limited categories, such as natural landscapes, and also required to train on high-resolution images with paired text. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for both global coherence and local context understanding, without any high-resolution text-image paired training dataset. We train the diffusion model to expand an image conditioned on global and local captions generated from the LLM and visual feature. At the inference stage, given an image and a global caption, we use the LLM to generate a next local caption to expand the input image. Then, we expand the image using the global caption, generated local caption and the visual feature to consider global consistency and spatial local context. In experiments, our model outperforms the baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively. Furthermore, our model demonstrates the capability of text-guided arbitrary-sized image generation in zero-shot manner with LLM guidance.</description>

      <title>Fusion Flow-enhanced Graph Pooling Residual Networks for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Surveillance in Day and Night Dual Visions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recognizing unauthorized Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) within designated no-fly zones throughout the day and night is of paramount importance, where the unauthorized UAVs pose a substantial threat to both civil and military aviation safety. However, recognizing UAVs day and night with dual-vision cameras is nontrivial, since red-green-blue (RGB) images suffer from a low detection rate under an insufficient light condition, such as on cloudy or stormy days, while black-and-white infrared (IR) images struggle to capture UAVs that overlap with the background at night. In this paper, we propose a new optical flow-assisted graph-pooling residual network (OF-GPRN), which significantly enhances the UAV detection rate in day and night dual visions. The proposed OF-GPRN develops a new optical fusion to remove superfluous backgrounds, which improves RGB/IR imaging clarity. Furthermore, OF-GPRN extends optical fusion by incorporating a graph residual split attention network and a feature pyramid, which refines the perception of UAVs, leading to a higher success rate in UAV detection. A comprehensive performance evaluation is conducted using a benchmark UAV catch dataset. The results indicate that the proposed OF-GPRN elevates the UAV mean average precision (mAP) detection rate to 87.8%, marking a 17.9% advancement compared to the residual graph neural network (ResGCN)-based approach.</description>

      <title>Is That Rain? Understanding Effects on Visual Odometry Performance for Autonomous UAVs and Efficient DNN-based Rain Classification at the Edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of safe and reliable autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles relies on the ability of the system to recognise and adapt to changes in the local environment based on sensor inputs. State-of-the-art local tracking and trajectory planning are typically performed using camera sensor input to the flight control algorithm, but the extent to which environmental disturbances like rain affect the performance of these systems is largely unknown. In this paper, we first describe the development of an open dataset comprising ~335k images to examine these effects for seven different classes of precipitation conditions and show that a worst-case average tracking error of 1.5 m is possible for a state-of-the-art visual odometry system (VINS-Fusion). We then use the dataset to train a set of deep neural network models suited to mobile and constrained deployment scenarios to determine the extent to which it may be possible to efficiently and accurately classify these `rainy' conditions. The most lightweight of these models (MobileNetV3 small) can achieve an accuracy of 90% with a memory footprint of just 1.28 MB and a frame rate of 93 FPS, which is suitable for deployment in resource-constrained and latency-sensitive systems. We demonstrate a classification latency in the order of milliseconds using typical flight computer hardware. Accordingly, such a model can feed into the disturbance estimation component of an autonomous flight controller. In addition, data from unmanned aerial vehicles with the ability to accurately determine environmental conditions in real time may contribute to developing more granular timely localised weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>Patch-Level Training for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable progress in language understanding and generation, their training efficiency has become a critical concern. Traditionally, LLMs are trained to predict the next token in a sequence. Despite the success of token-level training, it suffers from considerable computational costs due to the need to process an extensive number of tokens. To mitigate this issue, this paper introduces patch-level training for LLMs, which reduces the sequence length by compressing multiple tokens into a single patch. During patch-level training, we feed the language model shorter sequences of patches and train it to predict the next patch, thereby processing the majority of the training data at a significantly reduced computational cost. Following this, the model continues token-level training on the remaining training data to align with the inference mode. Experiments on a diverse range of models (370M-2.7B parameters) demonstrate that patch-level training can reduce overall computational costs to 0.5$\times$, without compromising the model performance compared to token-level training.

      <title>Enhancing the Utility of Privacy-Preserving Cancer Classification using Synthetic Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning holds immense promise for aiding radiologists in breast cancer detection. However, achieving optimal model performance is hampered by limitations in availability and sharing of data commonly associated to patient privacy concerns. Such concerns are further exacerbated, as traditional deep learning models can inadvertently leak sensitive training information. This work addresses these challenges exploring and quantifying the utility of privacy-preserving deep learning techniques, concretely, (i) differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) and (ii) fully synthetic training data generated by our proposed malignancy-conditioned generative adversarial network. We assess these methods via downstream malignancy classification of mammography masses using a transformer model. Our experimental results depict that synthetic data augmentation can improve privacy-utility tradeoffs in differentially private model training. Further, model pretraining on synthetic data achieves remarkable performance, which can be further increased with DP-SGD fine-tuning across all privacy guarantees. With this first in-depth exploration of privacy-preserving deep learning in breast imaging, we address current and emerging clinical privacy requirements and pave the way towards the adoption of private high-utility deep diagnostic models.

      <description>arXiv:2407.12671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently gained traction in symbolic music tasks, yet a lack of a unified framework impedes progress. Addressing this gap, we present GraphMuse, a graph processing framework and library that facilitates efficient music graph processing and GNN training for symbolic music tasks. Central to our contribution is a new neighbor sampling technique specifically targeted toward meaningful behavior in musical scores. Additionally, GraphMuse integrates hierarchical modeling elements that augment the expressivity and capabilities of graph networks for musical tasks. Experiments with two specific musical prediction tasks -- pitch spelling and cadence detection -- demonstrate significant performance improvement over previous methods. Our hope is that GraphMuse will lead to a boost in, and standardization of, symbolic music processing based on graph representations. The library is available at https://github.com/manoskary/graphmuse</description>

      <title>Towards Responsible Development of Generative AI for Education: An Evaluation-Driven Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major challenge facing the world is the provision of equitable and universal access to quality education. Recent advances in generative AI (gen AI) have created excitement about the potential of new technologies to offer a personal tutor for every learner and a teaching assistant for every teacher. The full extent of this dream, however, has not yet materialised. We argue that this is primarily due to the difficulties with verbalising pedagogical intuitions into gen AI prompts and the lack of good evaluation practices, reinforced by the challenges in defining excellent pedagogy. Here we present our work collaborating with learners and educators to translate high level principles from learning science into a pragmatic set of seven diverse educational benchmarks, spanning quantitative, qualitative, automatic and human evaluations; and to develop a new set of fine-tuning datasets to improve the pedagogical capabilities of Gemini, introducing LearnLM-Tutor. Our evaluations show that LearnLM-Tutor is consistently preferred over a prompt tuned Gemini by educators and learners on a number of pedagogical dimensions. We hope that this work can serve as a first step towards developing a comprehensive educational evaluation framework, and that this can enable rapid progress within the AI and EdTech communities towards maximising the positive impact of gen AI in education.</description>

      <title>The Dual Imperative: Innovation and Regulation in the AI Era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article addresses the societal costs associated with the lack of regulation in Artificial Intelligence and proposes a framework combining innovation and regulation. Over fifty years of AI research, catalyzed by declining computing costs and the proliferation of data, have propelled AI into the mainstream, promising significant economic benefits. Yet, this rapid adoption underscores risks, from bias amplification and labor disruptions to existential threats posed by autonomous systems. The discourse is polarized between accelerationists, advocating for unfettered technological advancement, and doomers, calling for a slowdown to prevent dystopian outcomes. This piece advocates for a middle path that leverages technical innovation and smart regulation to maximize the benefits of AI while minimizing its risks, offering a pragmatic approach to the responsible progress of AI technology. Technical invention beyond the most capable foundation models is needed to contain catastrophic risks. Regulation is required to create incentives for this research while addressing current issues.</description>

      <title>TransCAD: A Hierarchical Transformer for CAD Sequence Inference from Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D reverse engineering, in which a CAD model is inferred given a 3D scan of a physical object, is a research direction that offers many promising practical applications. This paper proposes TransCAD, an end-to-end transformer-based architecture that predicts the CAD sequence from a point cloud. TransCAD leverages the structure of CAD sequences by using a hierarchical learning strategy. A loop refiner is also introduced to regress sketch primitive parameters. Rigorous experimentation on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show that TransCAD achieves state-of-the-art results. The result analysis is supported with a proposed metric for CAD sequence, the mean Average Precision of CAD Sequence, that addresses the limitations of existing metrics.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Post-Processing Framework for Multi-Objective Learn-to-Defer Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learn-to-Defer is a paradigm that enables learning algorithms to work not in isolation but as a team with human experts. In this paradigm, we permit the system to defer a subset of its tasks to the expert. Although there are currently systems that follow this paradigm and are designed to optimize the accuracy of the final human-AI team, the general methodology for developing such systems under a set of constraints (e.g., algorithmic fairness, expert intervention budget, defer of anomaly, etc.) remains largely unexplored. In this paper, using a $d$-dimensional generalization to the fundamental lemma of Neyman and Pearson (d-GNP), we obtain the Bayes optimal solution for learn-to-defer systems under various constraints. Furthermore, we design a generalizable algorithm to estimate that solution and apply this algorithm to the COMPAS and ACSIncome datasets. Our algorithm shows improvements in terms of constraint violation over a set of baselines.</description>

      <title>An Evaluation of Continual Learning for Advanced Node Semiconductor Defect Inspection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based semiconductor defect inspection has gained traction in recent years, offering a powerful and versatile approach that provides high accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency in detecting and classifying nano-scale defects. However, semiconductor manufacturing processes are continually evolving, leading to the emergence of new types of defects over time. This presents a significant challenge for conventional supervised defect detectors, as they may suffer from catastrophic forgetting when trained on new defect datasets, potentially compromising performance on previously learned tasks. An alternative approach involves the constant storage of previously trained datasets alongside pre-trained model versions, which can be utilized for (re-)training from scratch or fine-tuning whenever encountering a new defect dataset. However, adhering to such a storage template is impractical in terms of size, particularly when considering High-Volume Manufacturing (HVM). Additionally, semiconductor defect datasets, especially those encompassing stochastic defects, are often limited and expensive to obtain, thus lacking sufficient representation of the entire universal set of defectivity. This work introduces a task-agnostic, meta-learning approach aimed at addressing this challenge, which enables the incremental addition of new defect classes and scales to create a more robust and generalized model for semiconductor defect inspection. We have benchmarked our approach using real resist-wafer SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) datasets for two process steps, ADI and AEI, demonstrating its superior performance compared to conventional supervised training methods.</description>

      <title>RoDE: Linear Rectified Mixture of Diverse Experts for Food Large Multi-Modal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) have significantly advanced a variety of vision-language tasks. The scalability and availability of high-quality training data play a pivotal role in the success of LMMs. In the realm of food, while comprehensive food datasets such as Recipe1M offer an abundance of ingredient and recipe information, they often fall short of providing ample data for nutritional analysis. The Recipe1M+ dataset, despite offering a subset for nutritional evaluation, is limited in the scale and accuracy of nutrition information. To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-Food, a unified food dataset that comprises over 100,000 images with various food labels, including categories, ingredients, recipes, and ingredient-level nutritional information. Uni-Food is designed to provide a more holistic approach to food data analysis, thereby enhancing the performance and capabilities of LMMs in this domain. To mitigate the conflicts arising from multi-task supervision during fine-tuning of LMMs, we introduce a novel Linear Rectification Mixture of Diverse Experts (RoDE) approach. RoDE utilizes a diverse array of experts to address tasks of varying complexity, thereby facilitating the coordination of trainable parameters, i.e., it allocates more parameters for more complex tasks and, conversely, fewer parameters for simpler tasks. RoDE implements linear rectification union to refine the router's functionality, thereby enhancing the efficiency of sparse task allocation. These design choices endow RoDE with features that ensure GPU memory efficiency and ease of optimization. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in addressing the inherent challenges of food-related multitasking.</description>

      <title>CHOSEN: Compilation to Hardware Optimization Stack for Efficient Vision Transformer Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) represent a groundbreaking shift in machine learning approaches to computer vision. Unlike traditional approaches, ViTs employ the self-attention mechanism, which has been widely used in natural language processing, to analyze image patches. Despite their advantages in modeling visual tasks, deploying ViTs on hardware platforms, notably Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), introduces considerable challenges. These challenges stem primarily from the non-linear calculations and high computational and memory demands of ViTs. This paper introduces CHOSEN, a software-hardware co-design framework to address these challenges and offer an automated framework for ViT deployment on the FPGAs in order to maximize performance. Our framework is built upon three fundamental contributions: multi-kernel design to maximize the bandwidth, mainly targeting benefits of multi DDR memory banks, approximate non-linear functions that exhibit minimal accuracy degradation, and efficient use of available logic blocks on the FPGA, and efficient compiler to maximize the performance and memory-efficiency of the computing kernels by presenting a novel algorithm for design space exploration to find optimal hardware configuration that achieves optimal throughput and latency. Compared to the state-of-the-art ViT accelerators, CHOSEN achieves a 1.5x and 1.42x improvement in the throughput on the DeiT-S and DeiT-B models.</description>

      <title>LookupViT: Compressing visual information to a limited number of tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViT) have emerged as the de-facto choice for numerous industry grade vision solutions. But their inference cost can be prohibitive for many settings, as they compute self-attention in each layer which suffers from quadratic computational complexity in the number of tokens. On the other hand, spatial information in images and spatio-temporal information in videos is usually sparse and redundant. In this work, we introduce LookupViT, that aims to exploit this information sparsity to reduce ViT inference cost. LookupViT provides a novel general purpose vision transformer block that operates by compressing information from higher resolution tokens to a fixed number of tokens. These few compressed tokens undergo meticulous processing, while the higher-resolution tokens are passed through computationally cheaper layers. Information sharing between these two token sets is enabled through a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism. The approach offers multiple advantages - (a) easy to implement on standard ML accelerators (GPUs/TPUs) via standard high-level operators, (b) applicable to standard ViT and its variants, thus generalizes to various tasks, (c) can handle different tokenization and attention approaches. LookupViT also offers flexibility for the compressed tokens, enabling performance-computation trade-offs in a single trained model. We show LookupViT's effectiveness on multiple domains - (a) for image-classification (ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-21K), (b) video classification (Kinetics400 and Something-Something V2), (c) image captioning (COCO-Captions) with a frozen encoder. LookupViT provides $2\times$ reduction in FLOPs while upholding or improving accuracy across these domains. In addition, LookupViT also demonstrates out-of-the-box robustness and generalization on image classification (ImageNet-C,R,A,O), improving by up to $4\%$ over ViT.</description>

      <title>OMG-Net: A Deep Learning Framework Deploying Segment Anything to Detect Pan-Cancer Mitotic Figures from Haematoxylin and Eosin-Stained Slides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mitotic activity is an important feature for grading several cancer types. Counting mitotic figures (MFs) is a time-consuming, laborious task prone to inter-observer variation. Inaccurate recognition of MFs can lead to incorrect grading and hence potential suboptimal treatment. In this study, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-aided approach to detect MFs in digitised haematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images (WSIs). Advances in this area are hampered by the limited number and types of cancer datasets of MFs. Here we establish the largest pan-cancer dataset of mitotic figures by combining an in-house dataset of soft tissue tumours (STMF) with five open-source mitotic datasets comprising multiple human cancers and canine specimens (ICPR, TUPAC, CCMCT, CMC and MIDOG++). This new dataset identifies 74,620 MFs and 105,538 mitotic-like figures. We then employed a two-stage framework (the Optimised Mitoses Generator Network (OMG-Net) to classify MFs. The framework first deploys the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to automate the contouring of MFs and surrounding objects. An adapted ResNet18 is subsequently trained to classify MFs. OMG-Net reaches an F1-score of 0.84 on pan-cancer MF detection (breast carcinoma, neuroendocrine tumour and melanoma), largely outperforming the previous state-of-the-art MIDOG++ benchmark model on its hold-out testing set (e.g. +16% F1-score on breast cancer detection, p&lt;0.001) thereby providing superior accuracy in detecting MFs on various types of tumours obtained with different scanners.</description>

      <title>PlayBest: Professional Basketball Player Behavior Synthesis via Planning with Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamically planning in complex systems has been explored to improve decision-making in various domains. Professional basketball serves as a compelling example of a dynamic spatio-temporal game, encompassing context-dependent decision-making. However, processing the diverse on-court signals and navigating the vast space of potential actions and outcomes make it difficult for existing approaches to swiftly identify optimal strategies in response to evolving circumstances. In this study, we formulate the sequential decision-making process as a conditional trajectory generation process. Based on the formulation, we introduce PlayBest (PLAYer BEhavior SynThesis), a method to improve player decision-making. We extend the diffusion probabilistic model to learn challenging environmental dynamics from historical National Basketball Association (NBA) player motion tracking data. To incorporate data-driven strategies, an auxiliary value function is trained with corresponding rewards. To accomplish reward-guided trajectory generation, we condition the diffusion model on the value function via classifier-guided sampling. We validate the effectiveness of PlayBest through simulation studies, contrasting the generated trajectories with those employed by professional basketball teams. Our results reveal that the model excels at generating reasonable basketball trajectories that produce efficient plays. Moreover, the synthesized play strategies exhibit an alignment with professional tactics, highlighting the model's capacity to capture the intricate dynamics of basketball games.</description>

      <title>Tiny Models are the Computational Saver for Large Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17726v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces TinySaver, an early-exit-like dynamic model compression approach which employs tiny models to substitute large models adaptively. Distinct from traditional compression techniques, dynamic methods like TinySaver can leverage the difficulty differences to allow certain inputs to complete their inference processes early, thereby conserving computational resources. Most existing early exit designs are implemented by attaching additional network branches to the model's backbone. Our study, however, reveals that completely independent tiny models can replace a substantial portion of the larger models' job with minimal impact on performance. Employing them as the first exit can remarkably enhance computational efficiency. By searching and employing the most appropriate tiny model as the computational saver for a given large model, the proposed approaches work as a novel and generic method to model compression. This finding will help the research community in exploring new compression methods to address the escalating computational demands posed by rapidly evolving AI models. Our evaluation of this approach in ImageNet-1k classification demonstrates its potential to reduce the number of compute operations by up to 90\%, with only negligible losses in performance, across various modern vision models.</description>

      <title>Instruction-Driven Game Engines on Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Instruction-Driven Game Engine (IDGE) project aims to democratize game development by enabling a large language model (LLM) to follow free-form game rules and autonomously generate game-play processes. The IDGE allows users to create games by issuing simple natural language instructions, which significantly lowers the barrier for game development. We approach the learning process for IDGEs as a Next State Prediction task, wherein the model autoregressively predicts in-game states given player actions. It is a challenging task because the computation of in-game states must be precise; otherwise, slight errors could disrupt the game-play. To address this, we train the IDGE in a curriculum manner that progressively increases the model's exposure to complex scenarios. Our initial progress lies in developing an IDGE for Poker, a universally cherished card game. The engine we've designed not only supports a wide range of poker variants but also allows for high customization of rules through natural language inputs. Furthermore, it also favors rapid prototyping of new games from minimal samples, proposing an innovative paradigm in game development that relies on minimal prompt and data engineering. This work lays the groundwork for future advancements in instruction-driven game creation, potentially transforming how games are designed and played.</description>

      <title>CausalMed: Causality-Based Personalized Medication Recommendation Centered on Patient health state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medication recommendation systems are developed to recommend suitable medications tailored to specific patient. Previous researches primarily focus on learning medication representations, which have yielded notable advances. However, these methods are limited to capturing personalized patient representations due to the following primary limitations: (i) unable to capture the differences in the impact of diseases/procedures on patients across various patient health states; (ii) fail to model the direct causal relationships between medications and specific health state of patients, resulting in an inability to determine which specific disease each medication is treating. To address these limitations, we propose CausalMed, a patient health state-centric model capable of enhancing the personalization of patient representations. Specifically, CausalMed first captures the causal relationship between diseases/procedures and medications through causal discovery and evaluates their causal effects. Building upon this, CausalMed focuses on analyzing the health state of patients, capturing the dynamic differences of diseases/procedures in different health states of patients, and transforming diseases/procedures into medications on direct causal relationships. Ultimately, CausalMed integrates information from longitudinal visits to recommend medication combinations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our method learns more personalized patient representation and outperforms state-of-the-art models in accuracy and safety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow by scaling laws, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has gained significant attention due to its outstanding performance. However, unlike pretraining or fine-tuning a single model, scaling reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for training large language models poses coordination challenges across four models. We present OpenRLHF, an open-source framework enabling efficient RLHF scaling. Unlike existing RLHF frameworks that co-locate four models on the same GPUs, OpenRLHF re-designs scheduling for the models beyond 70B parameters using Ray, vLLM, and DeepSpeed, leveraging improved resource utilization and diverse training approaches. Integrating seamlessly with Hugging Face, OpenRLHF provides an out-of-the-box solution with optimized algorithms and launch scripts, which ensures user-friendliness. OpenRLHF implements RLHF, DPO, rejection sampling, and other alignment techniques. Empowering state-of-the-art LLM development, OpenRLHF's code is available at \url{https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF}.</description>

      <title>Learning telic-controllable state representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational descriptions of purposeful behavior comprise both descriptive and normative} aspects. The former are used to ascertain current (or future) states of the world and the latter to evaluate the desirability, or lack thereof, of these states under some goal. In Reinforcement Learning, the normative aspect (reward and value functions) is assumed to depend on a predefined and fixed descriptive one (state representation). Alternatively, these two aspects may emerge interdependently: goals can be, and indeed often are, approximated by state-dependent reward functions, but they may also shape the acquired state representations themselves. Here, we present a novel computational framework for state representation learning in bounded agents, where descriptive and normative aspects are coupled through the notion of goal-directed, or telic, states. We introduce the concept of telic controllability to characterize the tradeoff between the granularity of a telic state representation and the policy complexity required to reach all telic states. We propose an algorithm for learning controllable state representations, illustrating it using a simple navigation task with shifting goals. Our framework highlights the crucial role of deliberate ignorance -- knowing which features of experience to ignore -- for learning state representations that balance goal flexibility and policy complexity. More broadly, our work advances a unified theoretical perspective on goal-directed state representation learning in natural and artificial agents.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Safety in Autonomous Driving: Integrating Latent State Diffusion Model for End-to-End Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06317v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advancement of autonomous driving, ensuring safety during motion planning and navigation is becoming more and more important. However, most end-to-end planning methods suffer from a lack of safety. This research addresses the safety issue in the control optimization problem of autonomous driving, formulated as Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs). We propose a novel, model-based approach for policy optimization, utilizing a conditional Value-at-Risk based Soft Actor Critic to manage constraints in complex, high-dimensional state spaces effectively. Our method introduces a worst-case actor to guide safe exploration, ensuring rigorous adherence to safety requirements even in unpredictable scenarios. The policy optimization employs the Augmented Lagrangian method and leverages latent diffusion models to predict and simulate future trajectories. This dual approach not only aids in navigating environments safely but also refines the policy's performance by integrating distribution modeling to account for environmental uncertainties. Empirical evaluations conducted in both simulated and real environment demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of safety, efficiency, and decision-making capabilities.</description>

      <title>Skywork-Math: Data Scaling Laws for Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models -- The Story Goes On</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the underlying factors that potentially enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We argue that the data scaling law for math reasoning capabilities in modern LLMs is far from being saturated, highlighting how the model's quality improves with increases in data quantity. To support this claim, we introduce the Skywork-Math model series, supervised fine-tuned (SFT) on common 7B LLMs using our proposed 2.5M-instance Skywork-MathQA dataset. Skywork-Math 7B has achieved impressive accuracies of 51.2% on the competition-level MATH benchmark and 83.9% on the GSM8K benchmark using only SFT data, outperforming an early version of GPT-4 on MATH. The superior performance of Skywork-Math models contributes to our novel two-stage data synthesis and model SFT pipelines, which include three different augmentation methods and a diverse seed problem set, ensuring both the quantity and quality of Skywork-MathQA dataset across varying difficulty levels. Most importantly, we provide several practical takeaways to enhance math reasoning abilities in LLMs for both research and industry applications.</description>

      <title>Molecule Language Model with Augmented Pairs and Expertise Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the molecules and their textual descriptions via molecule language models (MoLM) recently got a surge of interest among researchers. However, unique challenges exist in the field of MoLM due to 1) a limited amount of molecule-text paired data and 2) missing expertise that occurred due to the specialized areas of focus among the experts. To this end, we propose AMOLE, which 1) augments molecule-text pairs with structural similarity preserving loss, and 2) transfers the expertise between the molecules. Extensive experiments on various downstream tasks demonstrate the superiority of AMOLE in comprehending molecules and their descriptions, highlighting its potential for application in real-world drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Generating SROI^{-} Ontologies via Knowledge Graph Query Embedding Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Query embedding approaches answer complex logical queries over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs) by computing and operating on low-dimensional vector representations of entities, relations, and queries. However, current query embedding models heavily rely on excessively parameterized neural networks and cannot explain the knowledge learned from the graph. We propose a novel query embedding method, AConE, which explains the knowledge learned from the graph in the form of SROI^{-} description logic axioms while being more parameter-efficient than most existing approaches. AConE associates queries to a SROI^{-} description logic concept. Every SROI^{-} concept is embedded as a cone in complex vector space, and each SROI^{-} relation is embedded as a transformation that rotates and scales cones. We show theoretically that AConE can learn SROI^{-} axioms, and defines an algebra whose operations correspond one to one to SROI^{-} description logic concept constructs. Our empirical study on multiple query datasets shows that AConE achieves superior results over previous baselines with fewer parameters. Notably on the WN18RR dataset, AConE achieves significant improvement over baseline models. We provide comprehensive analyses showing that the capability to represent axioms positively impacts the results of query answering.</description>

      <title>LAB-Bench: Measuring Capabilities of Language Models for Biology Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is widespread optimism that frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) and LLM-augmented systems have the potential to rapidly accelerate scientific discovery across disciplines. Today, many benchmarks exist to measure LLM knowledge and reasoning on textbook-style science questions, but few if any benchmarks are designed to evaluate language model performance on practical tasks required for scientific research, such as literature search, protocol planning, and data analysis. As a step toward building such benchmarks, we introduce the Language Agent Biology Benchmark (LAB-Bench), a broad dataset of over 2,400 multiple choice questions for evaluating AI systems on a range of practical biology research capabilities, including recall and reasoning over literature, interpretation of figures, access and navigation of databases, and comprehension and manipulation of DNA and protein sequences. Importantly, in contrast to previous scientific benchmarks, we expect that an AI system that can achieve consistently high scores on the more difficult LAB-Bench tasks would serve as a useful assistant for researchers in areas such as literature search and molecular cloning. As an initial assessment of the emergent scientific task capabilities of frontier language models, we measure performance of several against our benchmark and report results compared to human expert biology researchers. We will continue to update and expand LAB-Bench over time, and expect it to serve as a useful tool in the development of automated research systems going forward. A public subset of LAB-Bench is available for use at the following URL: https://huggingface.co/datasets/futurehouse/lab-bench</description>

      <title>Enabling MCTS Explainability for Sequential Planning Through Computation Tree Logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is one of the most capable online search algorithms for sequential planning tasks, with significant applications in areas such as resource allocation and transit planning. Despite its strong performance in real-world deployment, the inherent complexity of MCTS makes it challenging to understand for users without technical background. This paper considers the use of MCTS in transportation routing services, where the algorithm is integrated to develop optimized route plans. These plans are required to meet a range of constraints and requirements simultaneously, further complicating the task of explaining the algorithm's operation in real-world contexts. To address this critical research gap, we introduce a novel computation tree logic-based explainer for MCTS. Our framework begins by taking user-defined requirements and translating them into rigorous logic specifications through the use of language templates. Then, our explainer incorporates a logic verification and quantitative evaluation module that validates the states and actions traversed by the MCTS algorithm. The outcomes of this analysis are then rendered into human-readable descriptive text using a second set of language templates. The user satisfaction of our approach was assessed through a survey with 82 participants. The results indicated that our explanatory approach significantly outperforms other baselines in user preference.</description>

      <title>Show, Don't Tell: Evaluating Large Language Models Beyond Textual Understanding with ChildPlay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the hypothesis that LLMs, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, possess broader cognitive functions, particularly in non-linguistic domains. Our approach extends beyond standard linguistic benchmarks by incorporating games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Battleship, encoded via ASCII, to assess strategic thinking and decision-making. To evaluate the models' ability to generalize beyond their training data, we introduce two additional games. The first game, LEGO Connect Language (LCL), tests the models' capacity to understand spatial logic and follow assembly instructions. The second game, the game of shapes, challenges the models to identify shapes represented by 1s within a matrix of zeros, further testing their spatial reasoning skills. This "show, don't tell" strategy uses games instead of simply querying the models. Our results show that despite their proficiency on standard benchmarks, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4's abilities to play and reason about fully observable games without pre-training is mediocre. Both models fail to anticipate losing moves in Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect Four, and they are unable to play Battleship correctly. While GPT-4 shows some success in the game of shapes, both models fail at the assembly tasks presented in the LCL game. These results suggest that while GPT models can emulate conversational proficiency and basic rule comprehension, their performance in strategic gameplay and spatial reasoning tasks is very limited. Importantly, this reveals a blind spot in current LLM benchmarks that we highlight with our gameplay benchmark suite ChildPlay (https://github.com/child-play-neurips/child-play). Our findings provide a cautionary tale about claims of emergent intelligence and reasoning capabilities of LLMs that are roughly the size of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This survey explores the burgeoning field of role-playing with language models, focusing on their development from early persona-based models to advanced character-driven simulations facilitated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Initially confined to simple persona consistency due to limited model capabilities, role-playing tasks have now expanded to embrace complex character portrayals involving character consistency, behavioral alignment, and overall attractiveness. We provide a comprehensive taxonomy of the critical components in designing these systems, including data, models and alignment, agent architecture and evaluation. This survey not only outlines the current methodologies and challenges, such as managing dynamic personal profiles and achieving high-level persona consistency but also suggests avenues for future research in improving the depth and realism of role-playing applications. The goal is to guide future research by offering a structured overview of current methodologies and identifying potential areas for improvement.

      <title>CatchBackdoor: Backdoor Detection via Critical Trojan Neural Path Fuzzing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.13064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in real-world applications has benefited from abundant pre-trained models. However, the backdoored pre-trained models can pose a significant trojan threat to the deployment of downstream DNNs. Numerous backdoor detection methods have been proposed but are limited to two aspects: (1) high sensitivity on trigger size, especially on stealthy attacks (i.e., blending attacks and defense adaptive attacks); (2) rely heavily on benign examples for reverse engineering. To address these challenges, we empirically observed that trojaned behaviors triggered by various trojan attacks can be attributed to the trojan path, composed of top-$k$ critical neurons with more significant contributions to model prediction changes. Motivated by it, we propose CatchBackdoor, a detection method against trojan attacks. Based on the close connection between trojaned behaviors and trojan path to trigger errors, CatchBackdoor starts from the benign path and gradually approximates the trojan path through differential fuzzing. We then reverse triggers from the trojan path, to trigger errors caused by diverse trojaned attacks. Extensive experiments on MINST, CIFAR-10, and a-ImageNet datasets and 7 models (LeNet, ResNet, and VGG) demonstrate the superiority of CatchBackdoor over the state-of-the-art methods, in terms of (1) \emph{effective} - it shows better detection performance, especially on stealthy attacks ($\sim$ $\times$ 2 on average); (2) \emph{extensible} - it is robust to trigger size and can conduct detection without benign examples.</description>

      <title>Lightning Fast Video Anomaly Detection via Adversarial Knowledge Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15597v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a very fast frame-level model for anomaly detection in video, which learns to detect anomalies by distilling knowledge from multiple highly accurate object-level teacher models. To improve the fidelity of our student, we distill the low-resolution anomaly maps of the teachers by jointly applying standard and adversarial distillation, introducing an adversarial discriminator for each teacher to distinguish between target and generated anomaly maps. We conduct experiments on three benchmarks (Avenue, ShanghaiTech, UCSD Ped2), showing that our method is over 7 times faster than the fastest competing method, and between 28 and 62 times faster than object-centric models, while obtaining comparable results to recent methods. Our evaluation also indicates that our model achieves the best trade-off between speed and accuracy, due to its previously unheard-of speed of 1480 FPS. In addition, we carry out a comprehensive ablation study to justify our architectural design choices. Our code is freely available at: https://github.com/ristea/fast-aed.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing Genomics with Reinforcement Learning Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving a wide range of problems, including decision-making and genomics. The exponential growth of raw genomic data over the past two decades has exceeded the capacity of manual analysis, leading to a growing interest in automatic data analysis and processing. RL algorithms are capable of learning from experience with minimal human supervision, making them well-suited for genomic data analysis and interpretation. One of the key benefits of using RL is the reduced cost associated with collecting labeled training data, which is required for supervised learning. While there have been numerous studies examining the applications of Machine Learning (ML) in genomics, this survey focuses exclusively on the use of RL in various genomics research fields, including gene regulatory networks (GRNs), genome assembly, and sequence alignment. We present a comprehensive technical overview of existing studies on the application of RL in genomics, highlighting the strengths and limitations of these approaches. We then discuss potential research directions that are worthy of future exploration, including the development of more sophisticated reward functions as RL heavily depends on the accuracy of the reward function, the integration of RL with other machine learning techniques, and the application of RL to new and emerging areas in genomics research. Finally, we present our findings and conclude by summarizing the current state of the field and the future outlook for RL in genomics.</description>

      <title>Modeling Relational Patterns for Logical Query Answering over Knowledge Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Answering first-order logical (FOL) queries over knowledge graphs (KG) remains a challenging task mainly due to KG incompleteness. Query embedding approaches this problem by computing the low-dimensional vector representations of entities, relations, and logical queries. KGs exhibit relational patterns such as symmetry and composition and modeling the patterns can further enhance the performance of query embedding models. However, the role of such patterns in answering FOL queries by query embedding models has not been yet studied in the literature. In this paper, we fill in this research gap and empower FOL queries reasoning with pattern inference by introducing an inductive bias that allows for learning relation patterns. To this end, we develop a novel query embedding method, RoConE, that defines query regions as geometric cones and algebraic query operators by rotations in complex space. RoConE combines the advantages of Cone as a well-specified geometric representation for query embedding, and also the rotation operator as a powerful algebraic operation for pattern inference. Our experimental results on several benchmark datasets confirm the advantage of relational patterns for enhancing logical query answering task.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding and Improving Knowledge Distillation for Neural Machine Translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising technique for model compression in neural machine translation. However, where the knowledge hides in KD is still not clear, which may hinder the development of KD. In this work, we first unravel this mystery from an empirical perspective and show that the knowledge comes from the top-1 predictions of teachers, which also helps us build a potential connection between word- and sequence-level KD. Further, we point out two inherent issues in vanilla word-level KD based on this finding. Firstly, the current objective of KD spreads its focus to whole distributions to learn the knowledge, yet lacks special treatment on the most crucial top-1 information. Secondly, the knowledge is largely covered by the golden information due to the fact that most top-1 predictions of teachers overlap with ground-truth tokens, which further restricts the potential of KD. To address these issues, we propose a novel method named \textbf{T}op-1 \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{D}istillation (TIE-KD). Specifically, we design a hierarchical ranking loss to enforce the learning of the top-1 information from the teacher. Additionally, we develop an iterative KD procedure to infuse more additional knowledge by distilling on the data without ground-truth targets. Experiments on WMT'14 English-German, WMT'14 English-French and WMT'16 English-Romanian demonstrate that our method can respectively boost Transformer$_{base}$ students by +1.04, +0.60 and +1.11 BLEU scores and significantly outperform the vanilla word-level KD baseline. Besides, our method shows higher generalizability on different teacher-student capacity gaps than existing KD techniques.</description>

      <title>Table Meets LLM: Can Large Language Models Understand Structured Table Data? A Benchmark and Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13062v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming attractive as few-shot reasoners to solve Natural Language (NL)-related tasks. However, the understanding of their capability to process structured data like tables remains an under-explored area. While tables can be serialized as input for LLMs, there is a lack of comprehensive studies on whether LLMs genuinely comprehend this data. In this paper, we try to understand this by designing a benchmark to evaluate the structural understanding capabilities of LLMs through seven distinct tasks, e.g., cell lookup, row retrieval and size detection. Specially, we perform a series of evaluations on the recent most advanced LLM models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 and observe that performance varied with different input choices, including table input format, content order, role prompting, and partition marks. Drawing from the insights gained through the benchmark evaluations, we propose $\textit{self-augmentation}$ for effective structural prompting, such as critical value / range identification using internal knowledge of LLMs. When combined with carefully chosen input choices, these structural prompting methods lead to promising improvements in LLM performance on a variety of tabular tasks, e.g., TabFact($\uparrow2.31\%$), HybridQA($\uparrow2.13\%$), SQA($\uparrow2.72\%$), Feverous($\uparrow0.84\%$), and ToTTo($\uparrow5.68\%$). We believe that our open source benchmark and proposed prompting methods can serve as a simple yet generic selection for future research. The code and data of this paper will be temporality released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/StructuredLLM-76F3/README.md and will be replaced with an official one at https://github.com/microsoft/TableProvider later.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their impressive performance in classification tasks, neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, subtle perturbations of the input data designed to deceive the model. In this work, we investigate the relation between these perturbations and the implicit bias of neural networks trained with gradient-based algorithms. To this end, we analyse the network's implicit bias through the lens of the Fourier transform. Specifically, we identify the minimal and most critical frequencies necessary for accurate classification or misclassification respectively for each input image and its adversarially perturbed version, and uncover the correlation among those. To this end, among other methods, we use a newly introduced technique capable of detecting non-linear correlations between high-dimensional datasets. Our results provide empirical evidence that the network bias in Fourier space and the target frequencies of adversarial attacks are highly correlated and suggest new potential strategies for adversarial defence.</description>

      <title>DIFFender: Diffusion-Based Adversarial Defense against Patch Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09124v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks, particularly patch attacks, pose significant threats to the robustness and reliability of deep learning models. Developing reliable defenses against patch attacks is crucial for real-world applications. This paper introduces DIFFender, a novel defense framework that harnesses the capabilities of a text-guided diffusion model to combat patch attacks. Central to our approach is the discovery of the Adversarial Anomaly Perception (AAP) phenomenon, which empowers the diffusion model to detect and localize adversarial patches through the analysis of distributional discrepancies. DIFFender integrates dual tasks of patch localization and restoration within a single diffusion model framework, utilizing their close interaction to enhance defense efficacy. Moreover, DIFFender utilizes vision-language pre-training coupled with an efficient few-shot prompt-tuning algorithm, which streamlines the adaptation of the pre-trained diffusion model to defense tasks, thus eliminating the need for extensive retraining. Our comprehensive evaluation spans image classification and face recognition tasks, extending to real-world scenarios, where DIFFender shows good robustness against adversarial attacks. The versatility and generalizability of DIFFender are evident across a variety of settings, classifiers, and attack methodologies, marking an advancement in adversarial patch defense strategies.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the life cycle of the machine learning (ML) model is an intriguing area of research (e.g., understanding where the model comes from, how it is trained, and how it is used). This paper focuses on a novel problem within this field, namely Model Provenance (MP), which concerns the relationship between a target model and its pre-training model and aims to determine whether a source model serves as the provenance for a target model. This is an important problem that has significant implications for ensuring the security and intellectual property of machine learning models but has not received much attention in the literature. To fill in this gap, we introduce a novel concept of Model DNA which represents the unique characteristics of a machine learning model. We utilize a data-driven and model-driven representation learning method to encode the model's training data and input-output information as a compact and comprehensive representation (i.e., DNA) of the model. Using this model DNA, we develop an efficient framework for model provenance identification, which enables us to identify whether a source model is a pre-training model of a target model. We conduct evaluations on both computer vision and natural language processing tasks using various models, datasets, and scenarios to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately identifying model provenance.</description>

      <title>Show Me the World in My Language: Establishing the First Baseline for Scene-Text to Scene-Text Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the task of visually translating scene text from a source language (e.g., Hindi) to a target language (e.g., English). Visual translation involves not just the recognition and translation of scene text but also the generation of the translated image that preserves visual features of the source scene text, such as font, size, and background. There are several challenges associated with this task, such as translation with limited context, deciding between translation and transliteration, accommodating varying text lengths within fixed spatial boundaries, and preserving the font and background styles of the source scene text in the target language. To address this problem, we make the following contributions: (i) We study visual translation as a standalone problem for the first time in the literature. (ii) We present a cascaded framework for visual translation that combines state-of-the-art modules for scene text recognition, machine translation, and scene text synthesis as a baseline for the task. (iii) We propose a set of task-specific design enhancements to design a variant of the baseline to obtain performance improvements. (iv) Currently, the existing related literature lacks any comprehensive performance evaluation for this novel task. To fill this gap, we introduce several automatic and user-assisted evaluation metrics designed explicitly for evaluating visual translation. Further, we evaluate presented baselines for translating scene text between Hindi and English. Our experiments demonstrate that although we can effectively perform visual translation over a large collection of scene text images, the presented baseline only partially addresses challenges posed by visual translation tasks. We firmly believe that this new task and the limitations of existing models, as reported in this paper, should encourage further research in visual translation.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Evaluation for Low-Latency Simultaneous Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03415v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The challenge of low-latency speech translation has recently draw significant interest in the research community as shown by several publications and shared tasks. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate these different approaches in realistic scenarios. However, currently only specific aspects of the systems are evaluated and often it is not possible to compare different approaches.
  In this work, we propose the first framework to perform and evaluate the various aspects of low-latency speech translation under realistic conditions. The evaluation is carried out in an end-to-end fashion. This includes the segmentation of the audio as well as the run-time of the different components.
  Secondly, we compare different approaches to low-latency speech translation using this framework. We evaluate models with the option to revise the output as well as methods with fixed output. Furthermore, we directly compare state-of-the-art cascaded as well as end-to-end systems. Finally, the framework allows to automatically evaluate the translation quality as well as latency and also provides a web interface to show the low-latency model outputs to the user.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the Integration of Prediction and Planning in Deep Learning-Based Automated Driving Systems: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated driving has the potential to revolutionize personal, public, and freight mobility. Beside accurately perceiving the environment, automated vehicles must plan a safe, comfortable, and efficient motion trajectory. To promote safety and progress, many works rely on modules that predict the future motion of surrounding traffic. Modular automated driving systems commonly handle prediction and planning as sequential, separate tasks. While this accounts for the influence of surrounding traffic on the ego vehicle, it fails to anticipate the reactions of traffic participants to the ego vehicle's behavior. Recent models increasingly integrate prediction and planning in a joint or interdependent step to model bi-directional interactions. To date, a comprehensive overview of different integration principles is lacking. We systematically review state-of-the-art deep learning-based prediction and planning, and focus on integrated prediction and planning models. Different facets of the integration ranging from model architecture and model design to behavioral aspects are considered and related to each other. Moreover, we discuss the implications, strengths, and limitations of different integration principles. By pointing out research gaps, describing relevant future challenges, and highlighting trends in the research field, we identify promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Amortizing Pragmatic Program Synthesis with Rankings</title>

Abstract: In program synthesis, an intelligent system takes in a set of user-generated examples and returns a program that is logically consistent with these examples. The usage of Rational Speech Acts (RSA) framework has been successful in building \emph{pragmatic} program synthesizers that return programs which -- in addition to being logically consistent -- account for the fact that a user chooses their examples informatively. However, the computational burden of running the RSA algorithm has restricted the application of pragmatic program synthesis to domains with a small number of possible programs. This work presents a novel method of amortizing the RSA algorithm by leveraging a \emph{global pragmatic ranking} -- a single, total ordering of all the hypotheses. We prove that for a pragmatic synthesizer that uses a single demonstration, our global ranking method exactly replicates RSA's ranked responses. We further empirically show that global rankings effectively approximate the full pragmatic synthesizer in an online, multi-demonstration setting. Experiments on two program synthesis domains using our pragmatic ranking method resulted in orders of magnitudes of speed ups compared to the RSA synthesizer, while outperforming the standard, non-pragmatic synthesizer.</description>

      <title>MuggleMath: Assessing the Impact of Query and Response Augmentation on Math Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In math reasoning with large language models (LLMs), fine-tuning data augmentation by query evolution and diverse reasoning paths is empirically verified effective, profoundly narrowing the gap between open-sourced LLMs and cutting-edge proprietary LLMs. In this paper, we conduct an investigation for such data augmentation in math reasoning and are intended to answer: (1) What strategies of data augmentation are more effective; (2) What is the scaling relationship between the amount of augmented data and model performance; and (3) Can data augmentation incentivize generalization to out-of-domain mathematical reasoning tasks? To this end, we create two new dataset AugGSM8K and AugMATH, by complicating and diversifying the queries and sampling multiple reasoning paths from GSM8K and MATH. We obtained a series of LLMs called MuggleMath by fine-tuning LLaMA models on AugGSM8K and AugMATH. MuggleMath substantially achieves new state-of-the-art on GSM8K and MATH. A log-linear relationship and a segmented log-linear are presented between MuggleMath's performance and the amount of augmented data on GSM8K and MATH, respectively. We also find that it is weak in out-of-domain math reasoning generalization from AugGSM8K to MATH and from AugMATH to GSM8K, which suggests that augmenting queries that cover a broader range of subjects is more beneficial for generalization. We release our codes and augmented data in https://github.com/OFA-Sys/gsm8k-ScRel.</description>

      <title>An Explainable Deep Learning-Based Method For Schizophrenia Diagnosis Using Generative Data-Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we leverage a deep learning-based method for the automatic diagnosis of schizophrenia using EEG brain recordings. This approach utilizes generative data augmentation, a powerful technique that enhances the accuracy of the diagnosis. To enable the utilization of time-frequency features, spectrograms were extracted from the raw signals. After exploring several neural network architectural setups, a proper convolutional neural network (CNN) was used for the initial diagnosis. Subsequently, using Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE), two different synthetic datasets were generated in order to augment the initial dataset and address the over-fitting issue. The augmented dataset using VAE achieved a 3.0\% improvement in accuracy reaching up to 99.0\% and yielded a lower loss value as well as a faster convergence. Finally, we addressed the lack of trust in black-box models using the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm to determine the most important superpixels (frequencies) in the diagnosis process.</description>

      <title>Attribute Based Interpretable Evaluation Metrics for Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When the training dataset comprises a 1:1 proportion of dogs to cats, a generative model that produces 1:1 dogs and cats better resembles the training species distribution than another model with 3:1 dogs and cats. Can we capture this phenomenon using existing metrics? Unfortunately, we cannot, because these metrics do not provide any interpretability beyond "diversity". In this context, we propose a new evaluation protocol that measures the divergence of a set of generated images from the training set regarding the distribution of attribute strengths as follows. Single-attribute Divergence (SaD) measures the divergence regarding PDFs of a single attribute. Paired-attribute Divergence (PaD) measures the divergence regarding joint PDFs of a pair of attributes. They provide which attributes the models struggle. For measuring the attribute strengths of an image, we propose Heterogeneous CLIPScore (HCS) which measures the cosine similarity between image and text vectors with heterogeneous initial points. With SaD and PaD, we reveal the following about existing generative models. ProjectedGAN generates implausible attribute relationships such as a baby with a beard even though it has competitive scores of existing metrics. Diffusion models struggle to capture diverse colors in the datasets. The larger sampling timesteps of latent diffusion model generate the more minor objects including earrings and necklaces. Stable Diffusion v1.5 better captures the attributes than v2.1. Our metrics lay a foundation for explainable evaluations of generative models.</description>

      <title>Automated Verification of Equivalence Properties in Advanced Logic Programs -- Bachelor Thesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19806v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increase in industrial applications using Answer Set Programming, the need for formal verification tools, particularly for critical applications, has also increased. During the program optimisation process, it would be desirable to have a tool which can automatically verify whether an optimised subprogram can replace the original subprogram. Formally this corresponds to the problem of verifying the strong equivalence of two programs. In order to do so, the translation tool anthem was developed. It can be used in conjunction with an automated theorem prover for classical logic to verify that two programs are strongly equivalent. With the current version of anthem, only the strong equivalence of positive programs with a restricted input language can be verified. This is a result of the translation $\tau^*$ implemented in anthem that produces formulas in the logic of here-and-there, which coincides with classical logic only for positive programs. This thesis extends anthem in order to overcome these limitations. First, the transformation $\sigma^*$ is presented, which transforms formulas from the logic of here-and-there to classical logic. A theorem formalises how $\sigma^*$ can be used to express equivalence in the logic of here-and-there in classical logic. Second, the translation $\tau^*$ is extended to programs containing pools. Another theorem shows how $\sigma^*$ can be combined with $\tau^*$ to express the strong equivalence of two programs in classical logic. With $\sigma^*$ and the extended $\tau^*$, it is possible to express the strong equivalence of logic programs containing negation, simple choices, and pools. Both the extended $\tau^*$ and $\sigma^*$ are implemented in a new version of anthem. Several examples of logic programs containing pools, negation, and simple choice rules, which the new version of anthem can translate to classical logic, are presented. Some a...</description>

      <title>NOD-TAMP: Generalizable Long-Horizon Planning with Neural Object Descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01530v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving complex manipulation tasks in household and factory settings remains challenging due to long-horizon reasoning, fine-grained interactions, and broad object and scene diversity. Learning skills from demonstrations can be an effective strategy, but such methods often have limited generalizability beyond training data and struggle to solve long-horizon tasks. To overcome this, we propose to synergistically combine two paradigms: Neural Object Descriptors (NODs) that produce generalizable object-centric features and Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) frameworks that chain short-horizon skills to solve multi-step tasks. We introduce NOD-TAMP, a TAMP-based framework that extracts short manipulation trajectories from a handful of human demonstrations, adapts these trajectories using NOD features, and composes them to solve broad long-horizon, contact-rich tasks. NOD-TAMP solves existing manipulation benchmarks with a handful of demonstrations and significantly outperforms prior NOD-based approaches on new tabletop manipulation tasks that require diverse generalization. Finally, we deploy NOD-TAMP on a number of real-world tasks, including tool-use and high-precision insertion. For more details, please visit https://nodtamp.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Scene Graph Generation with Hierarchical Relationships and Commonsense Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces an enhanced approach to generating scene graphs by incorporating both a relationship hierarchy and commonsense knowledge. Specifically, we begin by proposing a hierarchical relation head that exploits an informative hierarchical structure. It jointly predicts the relation super-category between object pairs in an image, along with detailed relations under each super-category. Following this, we implement a robust commonsense validation pipeline that harnesses foundation models to critique the results from the scene graph prediction system, removing nonsensical predicates even with a small language-only model. Extensive experiments on Visual Genome and OpenImage V6 datasets demonstrate that the proposed modules can be seamlessly integrated as plug-and-play enhancements to existing scene graph generation algorithms. The results show significant improvements with an extensive set of reasonable predictions beyond dataset annotations. Codes are available at https://github.com/bowen-upenn/scene_graph_commonsense.</description>

      <title>IG Captioner: Information Gain Captioners are Strong Zero-shot Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative training has been demonstrated to be powerful for building visual-language models. However, on zero-shot discriminative benchmarks, there is still a performance gap between models trained with generative and discriminative objectives. In this paper, we aim to narrow this gap by improving the efficacy of generative training on classification tasks, without any finetuning processes or additional modules.
  Specifically, we focus on narrowing the gap between the generative captioner and the CLIP classifier. We begin by analysing the predictions made by the captioner and classifier and observe that the caption generation inherits the distribution bias from the language model trained with pure text modality, making it less grounded on the visual signal. To tackle this problem, we redesign the scoring objective for the captioner to alleviate the distributional bias and focus on measuring the gain of information brought by the visual inputs. We further design a generative training objective to match the evaluation objective. We name our model trained and evaluated from the novel procedures as Information Gain (IG) captioner. We pretrain the models on the public Laion-5B dataset and perform a series of discriminative evaluations. For the zero-shot classification on ImageNet, IG captioner achieves $&gt; 18\%$ improvements over the standard captioner, achieving comparable performances with the CLIP classifier. IG captioner also demonstrated strong performance on zero-shot image-text retrieval tasks on MSCOCO and Flickr30K. We hope this paper inspires further research towards unifying generative and discriminative training procedures for visual-language models.</description>

      <title>TimeDRL: Disentangled Representation Learning for Multivariate Time-Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multivariate time-series data in numerous real-world applications (e.g., healthcare and industry) are informative but challenging due to the lack of labels and high dimensionality. Recent studies in self-supervised learning have shown their potential in learning rich representations without relying on labels, yet they fall short in learning disentangled embeddings and addressing issues of inductive bias (e.g., transformation-invariance). To tackle these challenges, we propose TimeDRL, a generic multivariate time-series representation learning framework with disentangled dual-level embeddings. TimeDRL is characterized by three novel features: (i) disentangled derivation of timestamp-level and instance-level embeddings from patched time-series data using a [CLS] token strategy; (ii) utilization of timestamp-predictive and instance-contrastive tasks for disentangled representation learning, with the former optimizing timestamp-level embeddings with predictive loss, and the latter optimizing instance-level embeddings with contrastive loss; and (iii) avoidance of augmentation methods to eliminate inductive biases, such as transformation-invariance from cropping and masking. Comprehensive experiments on 6 time-series forecasting datasets and 5 time-series classification datasets have shown that TimeDRL consistently surpasses existing representation learning approaches, achieving an average improvement of forecasting by 58.02% in MSE and classification by 1.48% in accuracy. Furthermore, extensive ablation studies confirmed the relative contribution of each component in TimeDRL's architecture, and semi-supervised learning evaluations demonstrated its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, even with limited labeled data. The code is available at https://github.com/blacksnail789521/TimeDRL.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-ES: Gradient-free Planning with Diffusion for Autonomous Driving and Zero-Shot Instruction Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel at modeling complex and multimodal trajectory distributions for decision-making and control. Reward-gradient guided denoising has been recently proposed to generate trajectories that maximize both a differentiable reward function and the likelihood under the data distribution captured by a diffusion model. Reward-gradient guided denoising requires a differentiable reward function fitted to both clean and noised samples, limiting its applicability as a general trajectory optimizer. In this paper, we propose DiffusionES, a method that combines gradient-free optimization with trajectory denoising to optimize black-box non-differentiable objectives while staying in the data manifold. Diffusion-ES samples trajectories during evolutionary search from a diffusion model and scores them using a black-box reward function. It mutates high-scoring trajectories using a truncated diffusion process that applies a small number of noising and denoising steps, allowing for much more efficient exploration of the solution space. We show that DiffusionES achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuPlan, an established closed-loop planning benchmark for autonomous driving. Diffusion-ES outperforms existing sampling-based planners, reactive deterministic or diffusion-based policies, and reward-gradient guidance. Additionally, we show that unlike prior guidance methods, our method can optimize non-differentiable language-shaped reward functions generated by few-shot LLM prompting. When guided by a human teacher that issues instructions to follow, our method can generate novel, highly complex behaviors, such as aggressive lane weaving, which are not present in the training data. This allows us to solve the hardest nuPlan scenarios which are beyond the capabilities of existing trajectory optimization methods and driving policies.</description>

      <title>BioMistral: A Collection of Open-Source Pretrained Large Language Models for Medical Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility in recent years, offering potential applications across specialized domains such as healthcare and medicine. Despite the availability of various open-source LLMs tailored for health contexts, adapting general-purpose LLMs to the medical domain presents significant challenges. In this paper, we introduce BioMistral, an open-source LLM tailored for the biomedical domain, utilizing Mistral as its foundation model and further pre-trained on PubMed Central. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of BioMistral on a benchmark comprising 10 established medical question-answering (QA) tasks in English. We also explore lightweight models obtained through quantization and model merging approaches. Our results demonstrate BioMistral's superior performance compared to existing open-source medical models and its competitive edge against proprietary counterparts. Finally, to address the limited availability of data beyond English and to assess the multilingual generalization of medical LLMs, we automatically translated and evaluated this benchmark into 7 other languages. This marks the first large-scale multilingual evaluation of LLMs in the medical domain. Datasets, multilingual evaluation benchmarks, scripts, and all the models obtained during our experiments are freely released.</description>

      <title>EmoBench: Evaluating the Emotional Intelligence of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the need for robust, comprehensive, and challenging benchmarks. Yet, research on evaluating their Emotional Intelligence (EI) is considerably limited. Existing benchmarks have two major shortcomings: first, they mainly focus on emotion recognition, neglecting essential EI capabilities such as emotion regulation and thought facilitation through emotion understanding; second, they are primarily constructed from existing datasets, which include frequent patterns, explicit information, and annotation errors, leading to unreliable evaluation. We propose EmoBench, a benchmark that draws upon established psychological theories and proposes a comprehensive definition for machine EI, including Emotional Understanding and Emotional Application. EmoBench includes a set of 400 hand-crafted questions in English and Chinese, which are meticulously designed to require thorough reasoning and understanding. Our findings reveal a considerable gap between the EI of existing LLMs and the average human, highlighting a promising direction for future research. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/Sahandfer/EmoBench.</description>

      <title>MerRec: A Large-scale Multipurpose Mercari Dataset for Consumer-to-Consumer Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the evolving e-commerce field, recommendation systems crucially shape user experience and engagement. The rise of Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) recommendation systems, noted for their flexibility and ease of access for customer vendors, marks a significant trend. However, the academic focus remains largely on Business-to-Consumer (B2C) models, leaving a gap filled by the limited C2C recommendation datasets that lack in item attributes, user diversity, and scale. The intricacy of C2C recommendation systems is further accentuated by the dual roles users assume as both sellers and buyers, introducing a spectrum of less uniform and varied inputs. Addressing this, we introduce MerRec, the first large-scale dataset specifically for C2C recommendations, sourced from the Mercari e-commerce platform, covering millions of users and products over 6 months in 2023. MerRec not only includes standard features such as user_id, item_id, and session_id, but also unique elements like timestamped action types, product taxonomy, and textual product attributes, offering a comprehensive dataset for research. This dataset, extensively evaluated across four recommendation tasks, establishes a new benchmark for the development of advanced recommendation algorithms in real-world scenarios, bridging the gap between academia and industry and propelling the study of C2C recommendations. Our experiment code is available at https://github.com/mercari/mercari-ml-merrec-pub-us and dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/mercari-us/merrec.</description>

      <title>Think Big, Generate Quick: LLM-to-SLM for Fast Autoregressive Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in practice and are widely used for generation tasks such as translation, summarization and instruction following. However, their enormous size and reliance on autoregressive decoding increase deployment costs and complicate their use in latency-critical applications. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach that combines language models of different sizes to increase the efficiency of autoregressive decoding while maintaining high performance. Our method utilizes a pretrained frozen LLM that encodes all prompt tokens once in parallel, and uses the resulting representations to condition and guide a small language model (SLM), which then generates the response more efficiently. We investigate the combination of encoder-decoder LLMs with both encoder-decoder and decoder-only SLMs from different model families and only require fine-tuning of the SLM. Experiments with various benchmarks show substantial speedups of up to $4\times$, with minor performance penalties of $1-2\%$ for translation and summarization tasks compared to the LLM.</description>

      <title>When Should Algorithms Resign? A Proposal for AI Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic resignation is a strategic approach for managing the use of artificial intelligence (AI) by embedding governance directly into AI systems. It involves deliberate and informed disengagement from AI, such as restricting access AI outputs or displaying performance disclaimers, in specific scenarios to aid the appropriate and effective use of AI. By integrating algorithmic resignation as a governance mechanism, organizations can better control when and how AI is used, balancing the benefits of automation with the need for human oversight.</description>

      <title>TaylorShift: Shifting the Complexity of Self-Attention from Squared to Linear (and Back) using Taylor-Softmax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism represents one of the biggest hurdles for processing long sequences using Transformers. Current methods, relying on sparse representations or stateful recurrence, sacrifice token-to-token interactions, which ultimately leads to compromises in performance. This paper introduces TaylorShift, a novel reformulation of the Taylor softmax that enables computing full token-to-token interactions in linear time and space. We analytically determine the crossover points where employing TaylorShift becomes more efficient than traditional attention, aligning closely with empirical measurements. Specifically, our findings demonstrate that TaylorShift enhances memory efficiency for sequences as short as 800 tokens and accelerates inference for inputs of approximately 1700 tokens and beyond. For shorter sequences, TaylorShift scales comparably with the vanilla attention. Furthermore, a classification benchmark across five tasks involving long sequences reveals no degradation in accuracy when employing Transformers equipped with TaylorShift. For reproducibility, we provide access to our code under https://github.com/tobna/TaylorShift.</description>

      <title>Credibility-Aware Multi-Modal Fusion Using Probabilistic Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of late multi-modal fusion for discriminative learning. Motivated by noisy, multi-source domains that require understanding the reliability of each data source, we explore the notion of credibility in the context of multi-modal fusion. We propose a combination function that uses probabilistic circuits (PCs) to combine predictive distributions over individual modalities. We also define a probabilistic measure to evaluate the credibility of each modality via inference queries over the PC. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our fusion method can reliably infer credibility while maintaining competitive performance with the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning with Attention-Aware Self-Adaptive Prompt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) models aim to incrementally learn new classes with scarce samples while preserving knowledge of old ones. Existing FSCIL methods usually fine-tune the entire backbone, leading to overfitting and hindering the potential to learn new classes. On the other hand, recent prompt-based CIL approaches alleviate forgetting by training prompts with sufficient data in each task. In this work, we propose a novel framework named Attention-aware Self-adaptive Prompt (ASP). ASP encourages task-invariant prompts to capture shared knowledge by reducing specific information from the attention aspect. Additionally, self-adaptive task-specific prompts in ASP provide specific information and transfer knowledge from old classes to new classes with an Information Bottleneck learning objective. In summary, ASP prevents overfitting on base task and does not require enormous data in few-shot incremental tasks. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate that ASP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSCIL and prompt-based CIL methods in terms of both learning new classes and mitigating forgetting.</description>

      <title>Towards Learning Contrast Kinetics with Multi-Condition Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrast agents in dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging allow to localize tumors and observe their contrast kinetics, which is essential for cancer characterization and respective treatment decision-making. However, contrast agent administration is not only associated with adverse health risks, but also restricted for patients during pregnancy, and for those with kidney malfunction, or other adverse reactions. With contrast uptake as key biomarker for lesion malignancy, cancer recurrence risk, and treatment response, it becomes pivotal to reduce the dependency on intravenous contrast agent administration. To this end, we propose a multi-conditional latent diffusion model capable of acquisition time-conditioned image synthesis of DCE-MRI temporal sequences. To evaluate medical image synthesis, we additionally propose and validate the Fr\'echet radiomics distance as an image quality measure based on biomarker variability between synthetic and real imaging data. Our results demonstrate our method's ability to generate realistic multi-sequence fat-saturated breast DCE-MRI and uncover the emerging potential of deep learning based contrast kinetics simulation. We publicly share our accessible codebase at https://github.com/RichardObi/ccnet and provide a user-friendly library for Fr\'echet radiomics distance calculation at https://pypi.org/project/frd-score.</description>

      <title>CHOPS: CHat with custOmer Profile Systems for Customer Service with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01343v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Businesses and software platforms are increasingly turning to Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GLM-3, and LLaMa-2 for chat assistance with file access or as reasoning agents for customer service. However, current LLM-based customer service models have limited integration with customer profiles and lack the operational capabilities necessary for effective service. Moreover, existing API integrations emphasize diversity over the precision and error avoidance essential in real-world customer service scenarios. To address these issues, we propose an LLM agent named CHOPS (CHat with custOmer Profile in existing System), designed to: (1) efficiently utilize existing databases or systems for accessing user information or interacting with these systems following existing guidelines; (2) provide accurate and reasonable responses or carry out required operations in the system while avoiding harmful operations; and (3) leverage a combination of small and large LLMs to achieve satisfying performance at a reasonable inference cost. We introduce a practical dataset, the CPHOS-dataset, which includes a database, guiding files, and QA pairs collected from CPHOS, an online platform that facilitates the organization of simulated Physics Olympiads for high school teachers and students. We have conducted extensive experiments to validate the performance of our proposed CHOPS architecture using the CPHOS-dataset, with the aim of demonstrating how LLMs can enhance or serve as alternatives to human customer service. Code for our proposed architecture and dataset can be found at {https://github.com/JingzheShi/CHOPS}.</description>

      <title>On Stronger Computational Separations Between Multimodal and Unimodal Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, multimodal machine learning has enjoyed huge empirical success (e.g. GPT-4). Motivated to develop theoretical justification for this empirical success, Lu (NeurIPS '23, ALT '24) introduces a theory of multimodal learning, and considers possible \textit{separations} between theoretical models of multimodal and unimodal learning. In particular, Lu (ALT '24) shows a computational separation, which is relevant to \textit{worst-case} instances of the learning task. In this paper, we give a stronger \textit{average-case} computational separation, where for ``typical'' instances of the learning task, unimodal learning is computationally hard, but multimodal learning is easy. We then question how ``natural'' the average-case separation is. Would it be encountered in practice? To this end, we prove that under basic conditions, any given computational separation between average-case unimodal and multimodal learning tasks implies a corresponding cryptographic key agreement protocol. We suggest to interpret this as evidence that very strong \textit{computational} advantages of multimodal learning may arise \textit{infrequently} in practice, since they exist only for the ``pathological'' case of inherently cryptographic distributions. However, this does not apply to possible (super-polynomial) \textit{statistical} advantages.</description>

      <title>StyleForge: Enhancing Text-to-Image Synthesis for Any Artistic Styles with Dual Binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have showcased their ability to create visual images from natural language prompts. However, existing methods like DreamBooth struggle with capturing arbitrary art styles due to the abstract and multifaceted nature of stylistic attributes. We introduce Single-StyleForge, a novel approach for personalized text-to-image synthesis across diverse artistic styles. Using approximately 15 to 20 images of the target style, Single-StyleForge establishes a foundational binding of a unique token identifier with a broad range of attributes of the target style. Additionally, auxiliary images are incorporated for dual binding that guides the consistent representation of crucial elements such as people within the target style. Furthermore, we present Multi-StyleForge, which enhances image quality and text alignment by binding multiple tokens to partial style attributes. Experimental evaluations across six distinct artistic styles demonstrate significant improvements in image quality and perceptual fidelity, as measured by FID, KID, and CLIP scores.</description>

      <title>Tackling Structural Hallucination in Image Translation with Local Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05980v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in diffusion models have advanced conditioned image generation, yet they struggle with reconstructing out-of-distribution (OOD) images, such as unseen tumors in medical images, causing "image hallucination" and risking misdiagnosis. We hypothesize such hallucinations result from local OOD regions in the conditional images. We verify that partitioning the OOD region and conducting separate image generations alleviates hallucinations in several applications. From this, we propose a training-free diffusion framework that reduces hallucination with multiple Local Diffusion processes. Our approach involves OOD estimation followed by two modules: a "branching" module generates locally both within and outside OOD regions, and a "fusion" module integrates these predictions into one. Our evaluation shows our method mitigates hallucination over baseline models quantitatively and qualitatively, reducing misdiagnosis by 40% and 25% in the real-world medical and natural image datasets, respectively. It also demonstrates compatibility with various pre-trained diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Tango 2: Aligning Diffusion-based Text-to-Audio Generations through Direct Preference Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09956v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative multimodal content is increasingly prevalent in much of the content creation arena, as it has the potential to allow artists and media personnel to create pre-production mockups by quickly bringing their ideas to life. The generation of audio from text prompts is an important aspect of such processes in the music and film industry. Many of the recent diffusion-based text-to-audio models focus on training increasingly sophisticated diffusion models on a large set of datasets of prompt-audio pairs. These models do not explicitly focus on the presence of concepts or events and their temporal ordering in the output audio with respect to the input prompt. Our hypothesis is focusing on how these aspects of audio generation could improve audio generation performance in the presence of limited data. As such, in this work, using an existing text-to-audio model Tango, we synthetically create a preference dataset where each prompt has a winner audio output and some loser audio outputs for the diffusion model to learn from. The loser outputs, in theory, have some concepts from the prompt missing or in an incorrect order. We fine-tune the publicly available Tango text-to-audio model using diffusion-DPO (direct preference optimization) loss on our preference dataset and show that it leads to improved audio output over Tango and AudioLDM2, in terms of both automatic- and manual-evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>An MRP Formulation for Supervised Learning: Generalized Temporal Difference Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15518v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In traditional statistical learning, data points are usually assumed to be independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) following an unknown probability distribution. This paper presents a contrasting viewpoint, perceiving data points as interconnected and employing a Markov reward process (MRP) for data modeling. We reformulate the typical supervised learning as an on-policy policy evaluation problem within reinforcement learning (RL), introducing a generalized temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm as a resolution. Theoretically, our analysis draws connections between the solutions of linear TD learning and ordinary least squares (OLS). We also show that under specific conditions, particularly when noises are correlated, the TD's solution proves to be a more effective estimator than OLS. Furthermore, we establish the convergence of our generalized TD algorithms under linear function approximation. Empirical studies verify our theoretical results, examine the vital design of our TD algorithm and show practical utility across various datasets, encompassing tasks such as regression and image classification with deep learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-armed bandits (MAB) and causal MABs (CMAB) are established frameworks for decision-making problems. The majority of prior work typically studies and solves individual MAB and CMAB in isolation for a given problem and associated data. However, decision-makers are often faced with multiple related problems and multi-scale observations where joint formulations are needed in order to efficiently exploit the problem structures and data dependencies. Transfer learning for CMABs addresses the situation where models are defined on identical variables, although causal connections may differ. In this work, we extend transfer learning to setups involving CMABs defined on potentially different variables, with varying degrees of granularity, and related via an abstraction map. Formally, we introduce the problem of causally abstracted MABs (CAMABs) by relying on the theory of causal abstraction in order to express a rigorous abstraction map. We propose algorithms to learn in a CAMAB, and study their regret. We illustrate the limitations and the strengths of our algorithms on a real-world scenario related to online advertising.</description>

      <title>Sim-Grasp: Learning 6-DOF Grasp Policies for Cluttered Environments Using a Synthetic Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Sim-Grasp, a robust 6-DOF two-finger grasping system that integrates advanced language models for enhanced object manipulation in cluttered environments. We introduce the Sim-Grasp-Dataset, which includes 1,550 objects across 500 scenarios with 7.9 million annotated labels, and develop Sim-GraspNet to generate grasp poses from point clouds. The Sim-Grasp-Polices achieve grasping success rates of 97.14% for single objects and 87.43% and 83.33% for mixed clutter scenarios of Levels 1-2 and Levels 3-4 objects, respectively. By incorporating language models for target identification through text and box prompts, Sim-Grasp enables both object-agnostic and target picking, pushing the boundaries of intelligent robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Progressive enhancement and restoration for mural images under low-light and defected conditions based on multi-receptive field strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08245</link>

Abstract: Ancient murals are valuable cultural heritage with great archaeological value. They provide insights into ancient religions, ceremonies, folklore, among other things through their content. However, due to long-term oxidation and inadequate protection, ancient murals have suffered continuous damage, including peeling and mold etc. Additionally, since ancient murals were typically painted indoors, the light intensity in images captured by digital devices is often low. The poor visibility hampers the further restoration of damaged areas. To address the escalating damage to ancient murals and facilitate batch restoration at archaeological sites, we propose a two-stage restoration model with automatic defect area detection strategy which called MER(Mural Enhancement and Restoration net) for ancient murals that are damaged and have been captured in low light. Our two-stage model not only enhances the visual quality of restored images but also achieves commendable results in relevant metric evaluations compared with other competitors. Furthermore, we have launched a website dedicated to the restoration of ancient mural paintings, utilizing the proposed model. Code is available at https://gitee.com/bbfan2024/MER.git.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Relevance Judgment in Product Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High relevance of retrieved and re-ranked items to the search query is the cornerstone of successful product search, yet measuring relevance of items to queries is one of the most challenging tasks in product information retrieval, and quality of product search is highly influenced by the precision and scale of available relevance-labelled data. In this paper, we present an array of techniques for leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating the relevance judgment of query-item pairs (QIPs) at scale. Using a unique dataset of multi-million QIPs, annotated by human evaluators, we test and optimize hyper parameters for finetuning billion-parameter LLMs with and without Low Rank Adaption (LoRA), as well as various modes of item attribute concatenation and prompting in LLM finetuning, and consider trade offs in item attribute inclusion for quality of relevance predictions. We demonstrate considerable improvement over baselines of prior generations of LLMs, as well as off-the-shelf models, towards relevance annotations on par with the human relevance evaluators. Our findings have immediate implications for the growing field of relevance judgment automation in product search.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Automated Alignment of LLMs: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alignment is the most critical step in building large language models (LLMs) that meet human needs. With the rapid development of LLMs gradually surpassing human capabilities, traditional alignment methods based on human-annotation are increasingly unable to meet the scalability demands. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore new sources of automated alignment signals and technical approaches. In this paper, we systematically review the recently emerging methods of automated alignment, attempting to explore how to achieve effective, scalable, automated alignment once the capabilities of LLMs exceed those of humans. Specifically, we categorize existing automated alignment methods into 4 major categories based on the sources of alignment signals and discuss the current status and potential development of each category. Additionally, we explore the underlying mechanisms that enable automated alignment and discuss the essential factors that make automated alignment technologies feasible and effective from the fundamental role of alignment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore uncertainty quantification in large language models (LLMs), with the goal to identify when uncertainty in responses given a query is large. We simultaneously consider both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, where the former comes from the lack of knowledge about the ground truth (such as about facts or the language), and the latter comes from irreducible randomness (such as multiple possible answers). In particular, we derive an information-theoretic metric that allows to reliably detect when only epistemic uncertainty is large, in which case the output of the model is unreliable. This condition can be computed based solely on the output of the model obtained simply by some special iterative prompting based on the previous responses. Such quantification, for instance, allows to detect hallucinations (cases when epistemic uncertainty is high) in both single- and multi-answer responses. This is in contrast to many standard uncertainty quantification strategies (such as thresholding the log-likelihood of a response) where hallucinations in the multi-answer case cannot be detected. We conduct a series of experiments which demonstrate the advantage of our formulation. Further, our investigations shed some light on how the probabilities assigned to a given output by an LLM can be amplified by iterative prompting, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Beyond Words: On Large Language Models Actionability in Mission-Critical Risk Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Risk analysis assesses potential risks in specific scenarios. Risk analysis principles are context-less; the same methodology can be applied to a risk connected to health and information technology security. Risk analysis requires a vast knowledge of national and international regulations and standards and is time and effort-intensive. A large language model can quickly summarize information in less time than a human and can be fine-tuned to specific tasks. Aim. Our empirical study aims to investigate the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation and fine-tuned LLM in Risk analysis. To our knowledge, no prior study has explored its capabilities in risk analysis. Method. We manually curated \totalscenarios unique scenarios leading to \totalsamples representative samples from over 50 mission-critical analyses archived by the industrial context team in the last five years. We compared the base GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models versus their Retrieval-Augmented Generation and fine-tuned counterparts. We employ two human experts as competitors of the models and three other three human experts to review the models and the former human expert's analysis. The reviewers analyzed 5,000 scenario analyses. Results and Conclusions. HEs demonstrated higher accuracy, but LLMs are quicker and more actionable. Moreover, our findings show that RAG-assisted LLMs have the lowest hallucination rates, effectively uncovering hidden risks and complementing human expertise. Thus, the choice of model depends on specific needs, with FTMs for accuracy, RAG for hidden risks discovery, and base models for comprehensiveness and actionability. Therefore, experts can leverage LLMs for an effective complementing companion in risk analysis within a condensed timeframe. They can also save costs by averting unnecessary expenses associated with implementing unwarranted countermeasures.</description>

      <title>Constrained Reinforcement Learning with Average Reward Objective: Model-Based and Model-Free Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) serves as a versatile framework for sequential decision-making, finding applications across diverse domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, recommendation systems, supply chain optimization, biology, mechanics, and finance. The primary objective in these applications is to maximize the average reward. Real-world scenarios often necessitate adherence to specific constraints during the learning process.
  This monograph focuses on the exploration of various model-based and model-free approaches for Constrained RL within the context of average reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The investigation commences with an examination of model-based strategies, delving into two foundational methods - optimism in the face of uncertainty and posterior sampling. Subsequently, the discussion transitions to parametrized model-free approaches, where the primal-dual policy gradient-based algorithm is explored as a solution for constrained MDPs. The monograph provides regret guarantees and analyzes constraint violation for each of the discussed setups.
  For the above exploration, we assume the underlying MDP to be ergodic. Further, this monograph extends its discussion to encompass results tailored for weakly communicating MDPs, thereby broadening the scope of its findings and their relevance to a wider range of practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Self-play with Execution Feedback: Improving Instruction-following Capabilities of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One core capability of large language models (LLMs) is to follow natural language instructions. However, the issue of automatically constructing high-quality training data to enhance the complex instruction-following abilities of LLMs without manual annotation remains unresolved. In this paper, we introduce AutoIF, the first scalable and reliable method for automatically generating instruction-following training data. AutoIF transforms the validation of instruction-following data quality into code verification, requiring LLMs to generate instructions, the corresponding code to check the correctness of the instruction responses, and unit test samples to verify the code's correctness. Then, execution feedback-based rejection sampling can generate data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) training. AutoIF achieves significant improvements across three training algorithms, SFT, Offline DPO, and Online DPO, when applied to the top open-source LLMs, Qwen2 and LLaMA3, in self-alignment and strong-to-weak distillation settings. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/QwenLM/AutoIF.</description>

      <title>Resource-efficient Medical Image Analysis with Self-adapting Forward-Forward Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a fast Self-adapting Forward-Forward Network (SaFF-Net) for medical imaging analysis, mitigating power consumption and resource limitations, which currently primarily stem from the prevalent reliance on back-propagation for model training and fine-tuning. Building upon the recently proposed Forward-Forward Algorithm (FFA), we introduce the Convolutional Forward-Forward Algorithm (CFFA), a parameter-efficient reformulation that is suitable for advanced image analysis and overcomes the speed and generalisation constraints of the original FFA. To address hyper-parameter sensitivity of FFAs we are also introducing a self-adapting framework SaFF-Net fine-tuning parameters during warmup and training in parallel. Our approach enables more effective model training and eliminates the previously essential requirement for an arbitrarily chosen Goodness function in FFA. We evaluate our approach on several benchmarking datasets in comparison with standard Back-Propagation (BP) neural networks showing that FFA-based networks with notably fewer parameters and function evaluations can compete with standard models, especially, in one-shot scenarios and large batch sizes. The code will be available at the time of the conference.</description>

      <title>Investigating and Defending Shortcut Learning in Personalized Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalized diffusion models have gained popularity for adapting pre-trained text-to-image models to generate images of specific topics with minimal training data. However, these models are vulnerable to minor adversarial perturbations, leading to degraded performance on corrupted datasets. Such vulnerabilities are further exploited to craft protective perturbations on sensitive images like portraits that prevent unauthorized generation. In response, diffusion-based purification methods have been proposed to remove these perturbations and retain generation performance. However, existing works turn to over-purifying the images, which causes information loss. In this paper, we take a closer look at the fine-tuning process of personalized diffusion models through the lens of shortcut learning. And we propose a hypothesis explaining the manipulation mechanisms of existing perturbation methods, demonstrating that perturbed images significantly deviate from their original prompts in the CLIP-based latent space. This misalignment during fine-tuning causes models to associate noisy patterns with identifiers, resulting in performance degradation. Based on these insights, we introduce a systematic approach to maintain training performance through purification. Our method first purifies the images to realign them with their original semantic meanings in latent space. Then, we introduce contrastive learning with negative tokens to decouple the learning of clean identities from noisy patterns, which shows a strong potential capacity against adaptive perturbation. Our study uncovers shortcut learning vulnerabilities in personalized diffusion models and provides a firm evaluation framework for future protective perturbation research.

      <title>YZS-model: A Predictive Model for Organic Drug Solubility Based on Graph Convolutional Networks and Transformer-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19136v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of drug molecule solubility is essential for determining their therapeutic effectiveness and safety, influencing the drug's ADME processes. Traditional solubility prediction techniques often fail to capture the complex nature of molecular tructures, leading to notable deviations between predictions and actual results. For example, the Discussion on Advanced Drug-Like Compound Structures. Lusci highlighted issues in capturing crucial cyclic structural information in molecules with ring structures. To overcome this issue, our research introduces a novel deep learning framework combining attention-based transformers, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), aimed at enhancing the precision of solubility predictions. Utilizing a training set of 9,943 compounds and testing on an anticancer compound dataset, our method achieved a correlation coefficient ($R^2$) of 0.59 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.57, which outperforms the benchmark models' scores of 0.52 ($R^2$) and 0.61 (RMSE). Importantly, in an additional independent test, our model significantly outperformed the baseline with an RMSE of 1.05 compared to 1.28, a relative accuracy improvement of 45.9%. This research not only demonstrates the vast potential of deep learning for improving solubility prediction accuracy but also offers novel insights for drug design and selection in the future. Continued efforts will be directed towards optimizing the model architecture and extending its application to better support the drug development process, underscoring the pivotal role of deep learning in drug discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01525v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although great progress has been made in 3D visual grounding, current models still rely on explicit textual descriptions for grounding and lack the ability to reason human intentions from implicit instructions. We propose a new task called 3D reasoning grounding and introduce a new benchmark ScanReason which provides over 10K question-answer-location pairs from five reasoning types that require the synerization of reasoning and grounding. We further design our approach, ReGround3D, composed of the visual-centric reasoning module empowered by Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) and the 3D grounding module to obtain accurate object locations by looking back to the enhanced geometry and fine-grained details from the 3D scenes. A chain-of-grounding mechanism is proposed to further boost the performance with interleaved reasoning and grounding steps during inference. Extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Data Augmentation for Robust LiDAR Semantic Segmentation in Adverse Weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02286v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing LiDAR semantic segmentation methods often struggle with performance declines in adverse weather conditions. Previous work has addressed this issue by simulating adverse weather or employing universal data augmentation during training. However, these methods lack a detailed analysis and understanding of how adverse weather negatively affects LiDAR semantic segmentation performance. Motivated by this issue, we identified key factors of adverse weather and conducted a toy experiment to pinpoint the main causes of performance degradation: (1) Geometric perturbation due to refraction caused by fog or droplets in the air and (2) Point drop due to energy absorption and occlusions. Based on these findings, we propose new strategic data augmentation techniques. First, we introduced a Selective Jittering (SJ) that jitters points in the random range of depth (or angle) to mimic geometric perturbation. Additionally, we developed a Learnable Point Drop (LPD) to learn vulnerable erase patterns with a Deep Q-Learning Network to approximate the point drop phenomenon from adverse weather conditions. Without precise weather simulation, these techniques strengthen the LiDAR semantic segmentation model by exposing it to vulnerable conditions identified by our data-centric analysis. Experimental results confirmed the suitability of the proposed data augmentation methods for enhancing robustness against adverse weather conditions. Our method achieves a notable 39.5 mIoU on the SemanticKITTI-to-SemanticSTF benchmark, improving the baseline by 8.1\%p and establishing a new state-of-the-art. Our code will be released at \url{https://github.com/engineerJPark/LiDARWeather}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address the challenges of sensor fusion and safety risk prediction, contemporary closed-loop autonomous driving neural networks leveraging imitation learning typically require a substantial volume of parameters and computational resources to run neural networks. Given the constrained computational capacities of onboard vehicular computers, we introduce a compact yet potent solution named EfficientFuser. This approach employs EfficientViT for visual information extraction and integrates feature maps via cross attention. Subsequently, it utilizes a decoder-only transformer for the amalgamation of multiple features. For prediction purposes, learnable vectors are embedded as tokens to probe the association between the task and sensor features through attention. Evaluated on the CARLA simulation platform, EfficientFuser demonstrates remarkable efficiency, utilizing merely 37.6% of the parameters and 8.7% of the computations compared to the state-of-the-art lightweight method with only 0.4% lower driving score, and the safety score neared that of the leading safety-enhanced method, showcasing its efficacy and potential for practical deployment in autonomous driving systems.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made impressive progress in handling simple math problems, yet they still struggle with more challenging and complex mathematical tasks. In this paper, we introduce a series of LLMs that employs the Decomposition of thought with code assistance and self-correction for mathematical reasoning, dubbed as DotaMath. DotaMath models tackle complex mathematical tasks by decomposing them into simpler logical subtasks, leveraging code to solve these subtasks, obtaining fine-grained feedback from the code interpreter, and engaging in self-reflection and correction. By annotating diverse interactive tool-use trajectories and employing query evolution on GSM8K and MATH datasets, we generate an instruction fine-tuning dataset called DotaMathQA with 574K query-response pairs. We train a series of base LLMs using imitation learning on DotaMathQA, resulting in DotaMath models that achieve remarkable performance compared to open-source LLMs across various in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. Notably, DotaMath-deepseek-7B showcases an outstanding performance of 64.8% on the competitive MATH dataset and 86.7% on GSM8K. Besides, DotaMath-deepseek-7B maintains strong competitiveness on a series of in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks (Avg. 80.1%). Looking forward, we anticipate that the DotaMath paradigm will open new pathways for addressing intricate mathematical problems.

      <title>Unlocking Textual and Visual Wisdom: Open-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection Enhanced by Comprehensive Guidance from Text and Image</title>

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection (OV-3DDet) aims to localize and recognize both seen and previously unseen object categories within any new 3D scene. While language and vision foundation models have achieved success in handling various open-vocabulary tasks with abundant training data, OV-3DDet faces a significant challenge due to the limited availability of training data. Although some pioneering efforts have integrated vision-language models (VLM) knowledge into OV-3DDet learning, the full potential of these foundational models has yet to be fully exploited. In this paper, we unlock the textual and visual wisdom to tackle the open-vocabulary 3D detection task by leveraging the language and vision foundation models. We leverage a vision foundation model to provide image-wise guidance for discovering novel classes in 3D scenes. Specifically, we utilize a object detection vision foundation model to enable the zero-shot discovery of objects in images, which serves as the initial seeds and filtering guidance to identify novel 3D objects. Additionally, to align the 3D space with the powerful vision-language space, we introduce a hierarchical alignment approach, where the 3D feature space is aligned with the vision-language feature space using a pre-trained VLM at the instance, category, and scene levels. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and generalization, highlighting the potential of foundation models in advancing open-vocabulary 3D object detection in real-world scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) is crucial for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and serves as a foundation for various applications that bridge cyberspace and the physical world. Recently, the emergence of Multi-modal Large Models (MLMs) and World Models (WMs) have attracted significant attention due to their remarkable perception, interaction, and reasoning capabilities, making them a promising architecture for the brain of embodied agents. However, there is no comprehensive survey for Embodied AI in the era of MLMs. In this survey, we give a comprehensive exploration of the latest advancements in Embodied AI. Our analysis firstly navigates through the forefront of representative works of embodied robots and simulators, to fully understand the research focuses and their limitations. Then, we analyze four main research targets: 1) embodied perception, 2) embodied interaction, 3) embodied agent, and 4) sim-to-real adaptation, covering the state-of-the-art methods, essential paradigms, and comprehensive datasets. Additionally, we explore the complexities of MLMs in virtual and real embodied agents, highlighting their significance in facilitating interactions in dynamic digital and physical environments. Finally, we summarize the challenges and limitations of embodied AI and discuss their potential future directions. We hope this survey will serve as a foundational reference for the research community and inspire continued innovation.

      <title>Pseudo-RIS: Distinctive Pseudo-supervision Generation for Referring Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new framework that automatically generates high-quality segmentation masks with their referring expressions as pseudo supervisions for referring image segmentation (RIS). These pseudo supervisions allow the training of any supervised RIS methods without the cost of manual labeling. To achieve this, we incorporate existing segmentation and image captioning foundation models, leveraging their broad generalization capabilities. However, the naive incorporation of these models may generate non-distinctive expressions that do not distinctively refer to the target masks. To address this challenge, we propose two-fold strategies that generate distinctive captions: 1) 'distinctive caption sampling', a new decoding method for the captioning model, to generate multiple expression candidates with detailed words focusing on the target. 2) 'distinctiveness-based text filtering' to further validate the candidates and filter out those with a low level of distinctiveness. These two strategies ensure that the generated text supervisions can distinguish the target from other objects, making them appropriate for the RIS annotations. Our method significantly outperforms both weakly and zero-shot SoTA methods on the RIS benchmark datasets. It also surpasses fully supervised methods in unseen domains, proving its capability to tackle the open-world challenge within RIS. Furthermore, integrating our method with human annotations yields further improvements, highlighting its potential in semi-supervised learning applications.</description>

      <title>Exploring State Space and Reasoning by Elimination in Tsetlin Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) has gained significant attention in Machine Learning (ML). By employing logical fundamentals, it facilitates pattern learning and representation, offering an alternative approach for developing comprehensible Artificial Intelligence (AI) with a specific focus on pattern classification in the form of conjunctive clauses. In the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP), TM is utilised to construct word embedding and describe target words using clauses. To enhance the descriptive capacity of these clauses, we study the concept of Reasoning by Elimination (RbE) in clauses' formulation, which involves incorporating feature negations to provide a more comprehensive representation. In more detail, this paper employs the Tsetlin Machine Auto-Encoder (TM-AE) architecture to generate dense word vectors, aiming at capturing contextual information by extracting feature-dense vectors for a given vocabulary. Thereafter, the principle of RbE is explored to improve descriptivity and optimise the performance of the TM. Specifically, the specificity parameter s and the voting margin parameter T are leveraged to regulate feature distribution in the state space, resulting in a dense representation of information for each clause. In addition, we investigate the state spaces of TM-AE, especially for the forgotten/excluded features. Empirical investigations on artificially generated data, the IMDB dataset, and the 20 Newsgroups dataset showcase the robustness of the TM, with accuracy reaching 90.62\% for the IMDB.</description>

Abstract: Template-free SMILES-to-SMILES translation models for reaction prediction and single-step retrosynthesis are of interest for industrial applications in computer-aided synthesis planning systems due to their state-of-the-art accuracy. However, they suffer from slow inference speed. We present a method to accelerate inference in autoregressive SMILES generators through speculative decoding by copying query string subsequences into target strings in the right places. We apply our method to the molecular transformer implemented in Pytorch Lightning and achieve over 3X faster inference in reaction prediction and single-step retrosynthesis, with no loss in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Self-supervised Learning for Multi-modality MRI Segmentation and Classification: A Novel Approach Avoiding Model Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide complementary information for computer-aided diagnosis. Traditional deep learning algorithms are suitable for identifying specific anatomical structures segmenting lesions and classifying diseases with magnetic resonance images. However, manual labels are limited due to high expense, which hinders further improvement of model accuracy. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can effectively learn feature representations from unlabeled data by pre-training and is demonstrated to be effective in natural image analysis. Most SSL methods ignore the similarity of multi-modality MRI, leading to model collapse. This limits the efficiency of pre-training, causing low accuracy in downstream segmentation and classification tasks. To solve this challenge, we establish and validate a multi-modality MRI masked autoencoder consisting of hybrid mask pattern (HMP) and pyramid barlow twin (PBT) module for SSL on multi-modality MRI analysis. The HMP concatenates three masking steps forcing the SSL to learn the semantic connections of multi-modality images by reconstructing the masking patches. We have proved that the proposed HMP can avoid model collapse. The PBT module exploits the pyramidal hierarchy of the network to construct barlow twin loss between masked and original views, aligning the semantic representations of image patches at different vision scales in latent space. Experiments on BraTS2023, PI-CAI, and lung gas MRI datasets further demonstrate the superiority of our framework over the state-of-the-art. The performance of the segmentation and classification is substantially enhanced, supporting the accurate detection of small lesion areas.

      <title>GROOT: Generating Robust Watermark for Diffusion-Model-Based Audio Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amid the burgeoning development of generative models like diffusion models, the task of differentiating synthesized audio from its natural counterpart grows more daunting. Deepfake detection offers a viable solution to combat this challenge. Yet, this defensive measure unintentionally fuels the continued refinement of generative models. Watermarking emerges as a proactive and sustainable tactic, preemptively regulating the creation and dissemination of synthesized content. Thus, this paper, as a pioneer, proposes the generative robust audio watermarking method (Groot), presenting a paradigm for proactively supervising the synthesized audio and its source diffusion models. In this paradigm, the processes of watermark generation and audio synthesis occur simultaneously, facilitated by parameter-fixed diffusion models equipped with a dedicated encoder. The watermark embedded within the audio can subsequently be retrieved by a lightweight decoder. The experimental results highlight Groot's outstanding performance, particularly in terms of robustness, surpassing that of the leading state-of-the-art methods. Beyond its impressive resilience against individual post-processing attacks, Groot exhibits exceptional robustness when facing compound attacks, maintaining an average watermark extraction accuracy of around 95%.</description>

      <title>Efficient Continual Learning with Low Memory Footprint For Edge Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continual learning(CL) is a useful technique to acquire dynamic knowledge continually. Although powerful cloud platforms can fully exert the ability of CL,e.g., customized recommendation systems, similar personalized requirements for edge devices are almost disregarded. This phenomenon stems from the huge resource overhead involved in training neural networks and overcoming the forgetting problem of CL. This paper focuses on these scenarios and proposes a compact algorithm called LightCL. Different from other CL methods bringing huge resource consumption to acquire generalizability among all tasks for delaying forgetting, LightCL compress the resource consumption of already generalized components in neural networks and uses a few extra resources to improve memory in other parts. We first propose two new metrics of learning plasticity and memory stability to seek generalizability during CL. Based on the discovery that lower and middle layers have more generalizability and deeper layers are opposite, we $\textit{Maintain Generalizability}$ by freezing the lower and middle layers. Then, we $\textit{Memorize Feature Patterns}$ to stabilize the feature extracting patterns of previous tasks to improve generalizability in deeper layers. In the experimental comparison, LightCL outperforms other SOTA methods in delaying forgetting and reduces at most $\textbf{6.16$\times$}$ memory footprint, proving the excellent performance of LightCL in efficiency. We also evaluate the efficiency of our method on an edge device, the Jetson Nano, which further proves our method's practical effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Hey, That's My Model! Introducing Chain &amp; Hash, An LLM Fingerprinting Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amid growing concerns over the ease of theft and misuse of Large Language Models (LLMs), the need for fingerprinting models has increased. Fingerprinting, in this context, means that the model owner can link a given model to their original version, thereby identifying if their model is being misused or has been completely stolen. In this paper, we first define a set five properties a successful fingerprint should satisfy; namely, the fingerprint should be Transparent, Efficient, Persistent, Robust, and Unforgeable. Next, we propose Chain &amp; Hash, a new, simple fingerprinting approach that implements a fingerprint with a cryptographic flavor, achieving all these properties. Chain &amp; Hash involves generating a set of questions (the fingerprints) along with a set of potential answers. These elements are hashed together using a secure hashing technique to select the value for each question, hence providing an unforgeability property-preventing adversaries from claiming false ownership. We evaluate the Chain &amp; Hash technique on multiple models and demonstrate its robustness against benign transformations, such as fine-tuning on different datasets, and adversarial attempts to erase the fingerprint. Finally, our experiments demonstrate the efficiency of implementing Chain &amp; Hash and its utility, where fingerprinted models achieve almost the same performance as non-fingerprinted ones across different benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Backdoor Graph Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, graph condensation has emerged as a prevalent technique to improve the training efficiency for graph neural networks (GNNs). It condenses a large graph into a small one such that a GNN trained on this small synthetic graph can achieve comparable performance to a GNN trained on a large graph. However, while existing graph condensation studies mainly focus on the best trade-off between graph size and the GNNs' performance (model utility), the security issues of graph condensation have not been studied. To bridge this research gap, we propose the task of backdoor graph condensation. While graph backdoor attacks have been extensively explored, applying existing graph backdoor methods for graph condensation is not practical since they can undermine the model utility and yield low attack success rate.
  To alleviate these issues, we introduce two primary objectives for backdoor attacks against graph condensation: 1) the injection of triggers cannot affect the quality of condensed graphs, maintaining the utility of GNNs trained on them; and 2) the effectiveness of triggers should be preserved throughout the condensation process, achieving high attack success rate. To pursue the objectives, we devise the first backdoor attack against graph condensation, denoted as BGC. Specifically, we inject triggers during condensation and iteratively update the triggers to ensure effective attacks. Further, we propose a poisoned node selection module to minimize the influence of triggers on condensed graphs' quality. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack. BGC achieves a high attack success rate (close to 1.0) and good model utility in all cases. Furthermore, the results demonstrate our method's resilience against multiple defense methods. Finally, we conduct comprehensive studies to analyze the factors that influence the attack performance.</description>

      <title>Balancing Immediate Revenue and Future Off-Policy Evaluation in Coupon Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupon allocation drives customer purchases and boosts revenue. However, it presents a fundamental trade-off between exploiting the current optimal policy to maximize immediate revenue and exploring alternative policies to collect data for future policy improvement via off-policy evaluation (OPE). While online A/B testing can validate new policies, it risks compromising short-term revenue. Conversely, relying solely on an exploitative policy hinders the ability to reliably estimate and enhance future policies. To balance this trade-off, we propose a novel approach that combines a model-based revenue maximization policy and a randomized exploration policy for data collection. Our framework enables flexibly adjusting the mixture ratio between these two policies to optimize the balance between short-term revenue and future policy improvement. We formulate the problem of determining the optimal mixture ratio between a model-based revenue maximization policy and a randomized exploration policy for data collection. We empirically verified the effectiveness of the proposed mixed policy using both synthetic and real-world data. Our main contributions are: (1) Demonstrating a mixed policy combining deterministic and probabilistic policies, flexibly adjusting the data collection vs. revenue trade-off. (2) Formulating the optimal mixture ratio problem as multi-objective optimization, enabling quantitative evaluation of this trade-off. By optimizing the mixture ratio, businesses can maximize revenue while ensuring reliable future OPE and policy improvement. This framework is applicable in any context where the exploration-exploitation trade-off is relevant.</description>

      <title>Building Intelligence Identification System via Large Language Model Watermarking: A Survey and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into diverse industries, posing substantial security risks due to unauthorized replication and misuse. To mitigate these concerns, robust identification mechanisms are widely acknowledged as an effective strategy. Identification systems for LLMs now rely heavily on watermarking technology to manage and protect intellectual property and ensure data security. However, previous studies have primarily concentrated on the basic principles of algorithms and lacked a comprehensive analysis of watermarking theory and practice from the perspective of intelligent identification. To bridge this gap, firstly, we explore how a robust identity recognition system can be effectively implemented and managed within LLMs by various participants using watermarking technology. Secondly, we propose a mathematical framework based on mutual information theory, which systematizes the identification process to achieve more precise and customized watermarking. Additionally, we present a comprehensive evaluation of performance metrics for LLM watermarking, reflecting participant preferences and advancing discussions on its identification applications. Lastly, we outline the existing challenges in current watermarking technologies and theoretical frameworks, and provide directional guidance to address these challenges. Our systematic classification and detailed exposition aim to enhance the comparison and evaluation of various methods, fostering further research and development toward a transparent, secure, and equitable LLM ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Segment, Lift and Fit: Automatic 3D Shape Labeling from 2D Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm for automatically labeling 3D objects from 2D point or box prompts, especially focusing on applications in autonomous driving. Unlike previous arts, our auto-labeler predicts 3D shapes instead of bounding boxes and does not require training on a specific dataset. We propose a Segment, Lift, and Fit (SLF) paradigm to achieve this goal. Firstly, we segment high-quality instance masks from the prompts using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and transform the remaining problem into predicting 3D shapes from given 2D masks. Due to the ill-posed nature of this problem, it presents a significant challenge as multiple 3D shapes can project into an identical mask. To tackle this issue, we then lift 2D masks to 3D forms and employ gradient descent to adjust their poses and shapes until the projections fit the masks and the surfaces conform to surrounding LiDAR points. Notably, since we do not train on a specific dataset, the SLF auto-labeler does not overfit to biased annotation patterns in the training set as other methods do. Thus, the generalization ability across different datasets improves. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that the SLF auto-labeler produces high-quality bounding box annotations, achieving an AP@0.5 IoU of nearly 90\%. Detectors trained with the generated pseudo-labels perform nearly as well as those trained with actual ground-truth annotations. Furthermore, the SLF auto-labeler shows promising results in detailed shape predictions, providing a potential alternative for the occupancy annotation of dynamic objects.</description>

Abstract: Controllable Image Captioning (CIC) aims at generating natural language descriptions for an image, conditioned on information provided by end users, e.g., regions, entities or events of interest. However, available image-language datasets mainly contain captions that describe the entirety of an image, making them ineffective for training CIC models that can potentially attend to any subset of regions or relationships. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel, fully automatic method to sample additional focused and visually grounded captions using a unified structured semantic representation built on top of the existing set of captions associated with an image. We leverage Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), a cross-lingual graph-based semantic formalism, to encode all possible spatio-semantic relations between entities, beyond the typical spatial-relations-only focus of current methods. We use this Structured Semantic Augmentation (SSA) framework to augment existing image-caption datasets with the grounded controlled captions, increasing their spatial and semantic diversity and focal coverage. We then develop a new model, CIC-BART-SSA, specifically tailored for the CIC task, that sources its control signals from SSA-diversified datasets. We empirically show that, compared to SOTA CIC models, CIC-BART-SSA generates captions that are superior in diversity and text quality, are competitive in controllability, and, importantly, minimize the gap between broad and highly focused controlled captioning performance by efficiently generalizing to the challenging highly focused scenarios.

      <title>QVD: Post-training Quantization for Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11585</link>

Abstract: Recently, video diffusion models (VDMs) have garnered significant attention due to their notable advancements in generating coherent and realistic video content. However, processing multiple frame features concurrently, coupled with the considerable model size, results in high latency and extensive memory consumption, hindering their broader application. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is an effective technique to reduce memory footprint and improve computational efficiency. Unlike image diffusion, we observe that the temporal features, which are integrated into all frame features, exhibit pronounced skewness. Furthermore, we investigate significant inter-channel disparities and asymmetries in the activation of video diffusion models, resulting in low coverage of quantization levels by individual channels and increasing the challenge of quantization. To address these issues, we introduce the first PTQ strategy tailored for video diffusion models, dubbed QVD. Specifically, we propose the High Temporal Discriminability Quantization (HTDQ) method, designed for temporal features, which retains the high discriminability of quantized features, providing precise temporal guidance for all video frames. In addition, we present the Scattered Channel Range Integration (SCRI) method which aims to improve the coverage of quantization levels across individual channels. Experimental validations across various models, datasets, and bit-width settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our QVD in terms of diverse metrics. In particular, we achieve near-lossless performance degradation on W8A8, outperforming the current methods by 205.12 in FVD.</description>

      <title>CCoE: A Compact LLM with Collaboration of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the domain of Large Language Model (LLM), LLMs demonstrate significant capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. With the growing needs of applying LLMs on various domains, it is a research question that how to efficiently train and build a model that has expertise in different domains but with a low training cost. We propose CCoE architecture, a framework of easily coupling multiple strong domain experts together to fuse into a big LLM, provides a collective way of utilizing the different domain expert LLMs. Besides, training a large collaborative of multiple expert LLMs requires a high requirements on training sources. CCoE bypasses this problem through isolating other experts and train each expert separately. The design of CCoE assembles multiple expert LLMs through the CoE (Collaboration of Experts) layer. Each CoE layer could have one or more expert LLMs. Expert LLMs have different number of layers and have been well-trained for different domain tasks. Each expert is fine-tuned to be able to achieve the comparable results with SOTA domain LLMs. We start from 5 experts in the domain of Code, Math, Law, text-to-SQL and Medical. The results indicate that our CCoE framework can easily and efficiently boost nearly 10%-20% performance on original base model in different domains but using less resources on training, as well as inference.</description>
