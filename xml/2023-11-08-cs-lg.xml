<title>Interpretability is not Explainability: New Quantitative XAI Approach with a focus on Recommender Systems in Education. (arXiv:2311.02078v1 [cs.IR])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02078</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence faces challenges due to the
absence of a widely accepted taxonomy that facilitates the quantitative
evaluation of explainability in Machine Learning algorithms. In this paper, we
propose a novel taxonomy that addresses the current gap in the literature by
providing a clear and unambiguous understanding of the key concepts and
relationships in XAI. Our approach is rooted in a systematic analysis of
existing definitions and frameworks, with a focus on transparency,
interpretability, completeness, complexity and understandability as essential
dimensions of explainability. This comprehensive taxonomy aims to establish a
shared vocabulary for future research. To demonstrate the utility of our

employing the SHAP package, we quantify and enhance the explainability of the

<title>Combining Deep Learning on Order Books with Reinforcement Learning for Profitable Trading. (arXiv:2311.02088v1 [q-fin.CP])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02088</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;High-frequency trading is prevalent, where automated decisions must be made
quickly to take advantage of price imbalances and patterns in price action that
forecast near-future movements. While many algorithms have been explored and
tested, analytical methods fail to harness the whole nature of the market
environment by focusing on a limited domain. With the evergrowing machine
learning field, many large-scale end-to-end studies on raw data have been
successfully employed to increase the domain scope for profitable trading but
are very difficult to replicate. Combining deep learning on the order books
with reinforcement learning is one way of breaking down large-scale end-to-end
learning into more manageable and lightweight components for reproducibility,
suitable for retail trading.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following work focuses on forecasting returns across multiple horizons
using order flow imbalance and training three temporal-difference learning
models for five financial instruments to provide trading signals. The
instruments used are two foreign exchange pairs (GBPUSD and EURUSD), two
indices (DE40 and FTSE100), and one commodity (XAUUSD). The performances of
these 15 agents are evaluated through backtesting simulation, and successful
models proceed through to forward testing on a retail trading platform. The
results prove potential but require further minimal modifications for
consistently profitable trading to fully handle retail trading costs, slippage,
and spread fluctuation.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Industrial particle accelerators inherently operate in much dirtier
environments than typical research accelerators. This leads to an increase in
noise both in the RF system and in other electronic systems. Combined with the
fact that industrial accelerators are mass produced, there is less attention
given to optimizing the performance of an individual system. As a result,
industrial systems tend to under perform considering their hardware hardware
capabilities. With the growing demand for accelerators for medical
sterilization, food irradiation, cancer treatment, and imaging, improving the
signal processing of these machines will increase the margin for the deployment
of these systems. Our work is focusing on using machine learning techniques to
reduce the noise of RF signals used for pulse-to-pulse feedback in industrial
accelerators. We will review our algorithms, simulation results, and results
working with measured data. We will then discuss next steps for deployment and
testing on an industrial system.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02100</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Advancement in the field of machine learning is unavoidable, but something of
major concern is preserving the privacy of the users whose data is being used
for training these machine learning algorithms. Federated learning(FL) has
emerged as a promising paradigm for training machine learning models in a
distributed and privacy-preserving manner which enables one to collaborate and
train a global model without sharing local data. But starting this learning
process on each device in the right way, called ``model initialization&quot; is
critical. The choice of initialization methods used for models plays a crucial
role in the performance, convergence speed, communication efficiency, privacy
guarantees of federated learning systems, etc. In this survey, we dive deeper
into a comprehensive study of various ways of model initialization techniques
in FL.Unlike other studies, our research meticulously compares, categorizes,
and delineates the merits and demerits of each technique, examining their
applicability across diverse FL scenarios. We highlight how factors like client
variability, data non-IIDness, model caliber, security considerations, and
network restrictions influence FL model outcomes and propose how strategic
initialization can address and potentially rectify many such challenges. The
motivation behind this survey is to highlight that the right start can help
overcome challenges like varying data quality, security issues, and network
problems. Our insights provide a foundational base for experts looking to fully
utilize FL, also while understanding the complexities of model initialization.

<title>Solving MaxSAT with Matrix Multiplication. (arXiv:2311.02101v1 [cs.AI])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02101</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We propose an incomplete algorithm for Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT)
specifically designed to run on neural network accelerators such as GPUs and
TPUs. Given a MaxSAT problem instance in conjunctive normal form, our procedure
constructs a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) with an equilibrium
distribution wherein the probability of a Boolean assignment is exponential in
the number of clauses it satisfies. Block Gibbs sampling is used to
stochastically search the space of assignments with parallel Markov chains.
Since matrix multiplication is the main computational primitive for block Gibbs
sampling in an RBM, our approach leads to an elegantly simple algorithm (40
lines of JAX) well-suited for neural network accelerators. Theoretical results
about RBMs guarantee that the required number of visible and hidden units of
the RBM scale only linearly with the number of variables and constant-sized
clauses in the MaxSAT instance, ensuring that the computational cost of a Gibbs
step scales reasonably with the instance size. Search throughput can be
increased by batching parallel chains within a single accelerator as well as by
distributing them across multiple accelerators. As a further enhancement, a
heuristic based on unit propagation running on CPU is periodically applied to
the sampled assignments. Our approach, which we term RbmSAT, is a new design
point in the algorithm-hardware co-design space for MaxSAT. We present timed
results on a subset of problem instances from the annual MaxSAT Evaluation&apos;s
Incomplete Unweighted Track for the years 2018 to 2021. When allotted the same
running time and CPU compute budget (but no TPUs), RbmSAT outperforms other
participating solvers on problems drawn from three out of the four years&apos;
competitions. Given the same running time on a TPU cluster for which RbmSAT is
uniquely designed, it outperforms all solvers on problems drawn from all four
years.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Dynamic shape computations have become critical in modern machine learning
workloads, especially in emerging large language models. The success of these
models has driven demand for deploying them to a diverse set of backend
environments. In this paper, we present Relax, a compiler abstraction for

first-class symbolic shape annotations to track dynamic shape computations
globally across the program. It also introduces a cross-level abstraction that
encapsulates computational graphs, loop-level tensor programs, and library
calls in a single representation to enable cross-level optimizations. We build
an end-to-end compilation framework using the proposed approach to optimize
dynamic shape models. Experimental results on large language models show that
Relax delivers performance competitive with state-of-the-art hand-optimized
systems across platforms and enables deployment of emerging dynamic models to a
broader set of environments, including mobile phones, embedded devices, and web

<title>Efficient Symbolic Policy Learning with Differentiable Symbolic Expression. (arXiv:2311.02104v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02104</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has led to a wide range of advances in
sequential decision-making tasks. However, the complexity of neural network
policies makes it difficult to understand and deploy with limited computational
resources. Currently, employing compact symbolic expressions as symbolic
policies is a promising strategy to obtain simple and interpretable policies.
Previous symbolic policy methods usually involve complex training processes and
pre-trained neural network policies, which are inefficient and limit the
application of symbolic policies. In this paper, we propose an efficient
gradient-based learning method named Efficient Symbolic Policy Learning (ESPL)
that learns the symbolic policy from scratch in an end-to-end way. We introduce
a symbolic network as the search space and employ a path selector to find the
compact symbolic policy. By doing so we represent the policy with a
differentiable symbolic expression and train it in an off-policy manner which
further improves the efficiency. In addition, in contrast with previous
symbolic policies which only work in single-task RL because of complexity, we
expand ESPL on meta-RL to generate symbolic policies for unseen tasks.
Experimentally, we show that our approach generates symbolic policies with
higher performance and greatly improves data efficiency for single-task RL. In
meta-RL, we demonstrate that compared with neural network policies the proposed
symbolic policy achieves higher performance and efficiency and shows the
potential to be interpretable.

<title>Making Harmful Behaviors Unlearnable for Large Language Models. (arXiv:2311.02105v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02105</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential as general-purpose AI
assistants in various domains. To meet the requirements of different
applications, LLMs are often customized by further fine-tuning. However, the
powerful learning ability of LLMs not only enables them to acquire new tasks
but also makes them susceptible to learning undesired behaviors. For example,
even safety-aligned LLMs can be easily fine-tuned into harmful assistants as
the fine-tuning data often contains implicit or explicit harmful content. Can
we train LLMs on harmful data without learning harmful behaviors? This paper
proposes a controllable training framework that makes harmful behaviors
unlearnable during the fine-tuning process. Specifically, we introduce
``security vectors&apos;&apos;, a few new parameters that can be separated from the LLM,
to ensure LLM&apos;s responses are consistent with the harmful behavior. Security
vectors are activated during fine-tuning, the consistent behavior makes LLM
believe that such behavior has already been learned, there is no need to
further optimize for harmful data. During inference, we can deactivate security
vectors to restore the LLM&apos;s normal behavior. The experimental results show
that the security vectors generated by 100 harmful samples are enough to
prevent LLM from learning 1000 harmful samples, while preserving the ability to
learn other useful information.

techniques for multi-class classification and provides a comprehensive

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The widespread use of ChatGPT and other emerging technology powered by
generative artificial intelligence (AI) has drawn much attention to potential
ethical issues, especially in high-stakes applications such as healthcare.
However, less clear is how to resolve such issues beyond following guidelines

hand, other types of generative AI have been used to synthesize images and
other types of data for research and practical purposes, which have resolved
some ethical issues and exposed other ethical issues, but such technology is
less often the focus of ongoing ethical discussions. Here we highlight gaps in
current ethical discussions of generative AI via a systematic scoping review of
relevant existing research in healthcare, and reduce the gaps by proposing an
ethics checklist for comprehensive assessment and transparent documentation of
ethical discussions in generative AI development. While the checklist can be
readily integrated into the current peer review and publication system to
enhance generative AI research, it may also be used in broader settings to
disclose ethics-related considerations in generative AI-powered products (or
real-life applications of such products) to help users establish reasonable
trust in their capabilities.

<title>Feature Attribution Explanations for Spiking Neural Networks. (arXiv:2311.02110v1 [cs.NE])</title>

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Third-generation artificial neural networks, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs),
can be efficiently implemented on hardware. Their implementation on
neuromorphic chips opens a broad range of applications, such as machine
learning-based autonomous control and intelligent biomedical devices. In
critical applications, however, insight into the reasoning of SNNs is
important, thus SNNs need to be equipped with the ability to explain how
decisions are reached. We present \textit{Temporal Spike Attribution} (TSA), a
local explanation method for SNNs. To compute the explanation, we aggregate all
information available in model-internal variables: spike times and model
weights. We evaluate TSA on artificial and real-world time series data and
measure explanation quality w.r.t. multiple quantitative criteria. We find that
TSA correctly identifies a small subset of input features relevant to the
decision (i.e., is output-complete and compact) and generates similar
explanations for similar inputs (i.e., is continuous). Further, our experiments
show that incorporating the notion of \emph{absent} spikes improves explanation
quality. Our work can serve as a starting point for explainable SNNs, with
future implementations on hardware yielding not only predictions but also
explanations in a broad range of application scenarios. Source code is

<title>Towards objective and systematic evaluation of bias in medical imaging AI. (arXiv:2311.02115v1 [cs.CV])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02115</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) models trained using medical images for clinical
tasks often exhibit bias in the form of disparities in performance between
subgroups. Since not all sources of biases in real-world medical imaging data
are easily identifiable, it is challenging to comprehensively assess how those
biases are encoded in models, and how capable bias mitigation methods are at
ameliorating performance disparities. In this article, we introduce a novel
analysis framework for systematically and objectively investigating the impact
of biases in medical images on AI models. We developed and tested this
framework for conducting controlled in silico trials to assess bias in medical
imaging AI using a tool for generating synthetic magnetic resonance images with
known disease effects and sources of bias. The feasibility is showcased by
using three counterfactual bias scenarios to measure the impact of simulated
bias effects on a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier and the
efficacy of three bias mitigation strategies. The analysis revealed that the
simulated biases resulted in expected subgroup performance disparities when the
CNN was trained on the synthetic datasets. Moreover, reweighing was identified
as the most successful bias mitigation strategy for this setup, and we
demonstrated how explainable AI methods can aid in investigating the
manifestation of bias in the model using this framework. Developing fair AI
models is a considerable challenge given that many and often unknown sources of
biases can be present in medical imaging datasets. In this work, we present a
novel methodology to objectively study the impact of biases and mitigation
strategies on deep learning pipelines, which can support the development of
clinical AI that is robust and responsible.

<title>Resist Label Noise with PGM for Graph Neural Networks. (arXiv:2311.02116v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02116</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;While robust graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely studied for graph
perturbation and attack, those for label noise have received significantly less
attention. Most existing methods heavily rely on the label smoothness
assumption to correct noisy labels, which adversely affects their performance
on heterophilous graphs. Further, they generally perform poorly in high
noise-rate scenarios. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a
novel probabilistic graphical model (PGM) based framework LNP. Given a noisy
label set and a clean label set, our goal is to maximize the likelihood of
labels in the clean set. We first present LNP-v1, which generates clean labels
based on graphs only in the Bayesian network. To further leverage the
information of clean labels in the noisy label set, we put forward LNP-v2,
which incorporates the noisy label set into the Bayesian network to generate
clean labels. The generative process can then be used to predict labels for
unlabeled nodes. We conduct extensive experiments to show the robustness of LNP
on varying noise types and rates, and also on graphs with different
heterophilies. In particular, we show that LNP can lead to inspiring
performance in high noise-rate situations.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02117</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Graph research, the systematic study of interconnected data points
represented as graphs, plays a vital role in capturing intricate relationships
within networked systems. However, in the real world, as graphs scale up,
concerns about data security among different data-owning agencies arise,
hindering information sharing and, ultimately, the utilization of graph data.
Therefore, establishing a mutual trust mechanism among graph agencies is
crucial for unlocking the full potential of graphs. Here, we introduce a
Cooperative Network Learning (CNL) framework to ensure secure graph computing
for various graph tasks. Essentially, this CNL framework unifies the local and
global perspectives of GNN computing with distributed data for an agency by
virtually connecting all participating agencies as a global graph without a
fixed central coordinator. Inter-agency computing is protected by various
technologies inherent in our framework, including homomorphic encryption and
secure transmission. Moreover, each agency has a fair right to design or employ
various graph learning models from its local or global perspective. Thus, CNL
can collaboratively train GNN models based on decentralized graphs inferred
from local and global graphs. Experiments on contagion dynamics prediction and
traditional graph tasks (i.e., node classification and link prediction)
demonstrate that our CNL architecture outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs
developed at individual sites, revealing that CNL can provide a reliable, fair,
secure, privacy-preserving, and global perspective to build effective and
personalized models for network applications. We hope this framework will
address privacy concerns in graph-related research and integrate decentralized
graph data structures to benefit the network research community in cooperation
and innovation.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Sequential processes in real-world often carry a combination of simple
subsystems that interact with each other in certain forms. Learning such a
modular structure can often improve the robustness against environmental

for exploiting the underlying modular structure of the target task. Our model
adopts cell selection, input feature selection, hidden state selection, and
soft state updating to achieve a better generalization ability on the basis of
the recent Grid LSTM for the tasks where some factors differ between training
and evaluation. Specifically, at each time step, only a fraction of cells are
activated, and the activated cells select relevant inputs and cells to
communicate with. At the end of one time step, the hidden states of the
activated cells are updated by considering the relevance between the inputs and
the hidden states from the last and current time steps. Extensive experiments
on diversified sequential modeling tasks are conducted to show the superior
generalization ability when there exist changes in the testing environment.

<title>Sliced Denoising: A Physics-Informed Molecular Pre-Training Method. (arXiv:2311.02124v1 [q-bio.BM])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02124</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;While molecular pre-training has shown great potential in enhancing drug
discovery, the lack of a solid physical interpretation in current methods
raises concerns about whether the learned representation truly captures the
underlying explanatory factors in observed data, ultimately resulting in
limited generalization and robustness. Although denoising methods offer a
physical interpretation, their accuracy is often compromised by ad-hoc noise
design, leading to inaccurate learned force fields. To address this limitation,
this paper proposes a new method for molecular pre-training, called sliced
denoising (SliDe), which is based on the classical mechanical intramolecular
potential theory. SliDe utilizes a novel noise strategy that perturbs bond
lengths, angles, and torsion angles to achieve better sampling over
conformations. Additionally, it introduces a random slicing approach that
circumvents the computationally expensive calculation of the Jacobian matrix,
which is otherwise essential for estimating the force field. By aligning with
physical principles, SliDe shows a 42\% improvement in the accuracy of
estimated force fields compared to current state-of-the-art denoising methods,
and thus outperforms traditional baselines on various molecular property
prediction tasks.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We consider the inventory management problem, where the goal is to balance
conflicting objectives such as availability and wastage of a large range of
products in a store. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that
utilises General Value Functions (GVFs) to derive domain-backed inventory
replenishment policies. The inventory replenishment decisions are modelled as a
sequential decision making problem, which is challenging due to uncertain
demand and the existence of aggregate (cross-product) constraints. In existing
literature, GVFs have primarily been used for auxiliary task learning. We use
this capability to train GVFs on domain-critical characteristics such as
prediction of stock-out probability and wastage quantity. Using this domain
expertise for more effective exploration, we train an RL agent to compute the
inventory replenishment quantities for a large range of products (up to 6000 in
the reported experiments), which share aggregate constraints such as the total
weight/volume per delivery. Additionally, we show that the GVF predictions can
be used to provide additional domain-backed insights into the decisions
proposed by the RL agent. Finally, since the environment dynamics are fully
transferred, the trained GVFs can be used for faster adaptation to vastly
different business objectives (for example, due to the start of a promotional
period or due to deployment in a new customer environment).

<title>Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Power Network Topology Control. (arXiv:2311.02129v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02129</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Learning in high-dimensional action spaces is a key challenge in applying
reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world systems. In this paper, we study the
possibility of controlling power networks using RL methods. Power networks are
critical infrastructures that are complex to control. In particular, the
combinatorial nature of the action space poses a challenge to both conventional
optimizers and learned controllers. Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL)
represents one approach to address this challenge. More precisely, a HRL
framework for power network topology control is proposed. The HRL framework
consists of three levels of action abstraction. At the highest level, there is
the overall long-term task of power network operation, namely, keeping the
power grid state within security constraints at all times, which is decomposed
into two temporally extended actions: &apos;do nothing&apos; versus &apos;propose a topology
change&apos;. At the intermediate level, the action space consists of all
controllable substations. Finally, at the lowest level, the action space
consists of all configurations of the chosen substation. By employing this HRL
framework, several hierarchical power network agents are trained for the IEEE
14-bus network. Whereas at the highest level a purely rule-based policy is
still chosen for all agents in this study, at the intermediate level the policy
is trained using different state-of-the-art RL algorithms. At the lowest level,
either an RL algorithm or a greedy algorithm is used. The performance of the
different 3-level agents is compared with standard baseline (RL or greedy)
approaches. A key finding is that the 3-level agent that employs RL both at the
intermediate and the lowest level outperforms all other agents on the most
difficult task. Our code is publicly available.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02130</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) shows great advantages over
conventional two-layer federated learning (FL) in reducing network overhead and
interaction latency while still retaining the data privacy of distributed FL
clients. However, the communication and energy overhead still pose a bottleneck
for HFL performance, especially as the number of clients raises dramatically.
To tackle this issue, we propose a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)
enabled HFL system under semi-synchronous cloud model aggregation in this
paper, aiming to minimize the total cost of time and energy at each HFL global
round. Specifically, we first propose a novel fuzzy logic based client
orchestration policy considering client heterogenerity in multiple aspects,
including channel quality, data quantity and model staleness. Subsequently,
given the fuzzy based client-edge association, a joint edge server scheduling
and resource allocation problem is formulated. Utilizing problem decomposition,
we firstly derive the closed-form solution for the edge server scheduling
subproblem via the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method. Next, a deep
deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based algorithm is proposed to tackle the
resource allocation subproblem considering time-varying environments. Finally,
extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the
considered benchmarks regarding HFL performance improvement and total cost
reduction.

SparseDiff, a denoising diffusion model for graph generation that is able to
exploit sparsity during its training phase. At the core of SparseDiff is a
message-passing neural network tailored to predict only a subset of edges
during each forward pass. When combined with a sparsity-preserving noise model,
this model can efficiently work with edge lists representations of graphs,
paving the way for scalability to much larger structures. During the sampling
phase, SparseDiff iteratively populates the adjacency matrix from its prior
state, ensuring prediction of the full graph while controlling memory
utilization. Experimental results show that SparseDiff simultaneously matches
state-of-the-art in generation performance on both small and large graphs,
highlighting the versatility of our method.

<title>Bayesian Optimization of Function Networks with Partial Evaluations. (arXiv:2311.02146v1 [stat.ML])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02146</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Bayesian optimization is a framework for optimizing functions that are costly
or time-consuming to evaluate. Recent work has considered Bayesian optimization
of function networks (BOFN), where the objective function is computed via a
network of functions, each taking as input the output of previous nodes in the
network and additional parameters. Exploiting this network structure has been
shown to yield significant performance improvements. Existing BOFN algorithms
for general-purpose networks are required to evaluate the full network at each
iteration. However, many real-world applications allow evaluating nodes
individually. To take advantage of this opportunity, we propose a novel
knowledge gradient acquisition function for BOFN that chooses which node to
evaluate as well as the inputs for that node in a cost-aware fashion. This
approach can dramatically reduce query costs by allowing the evaluation of part
of the network at a lower cost relative to evaluating the entire network. We
provide an efficient approach to optimizing our acquisition function and show
it outperforms existing BOFN methods and other benchmarks across several
synthetic and real-world problems. Our acquisition function is the first to
enable cost-aware optimization of a broad class of function networks.

<title>The Alignment Problem in Context. (arXiv:2311.02147v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02147</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;A core challenge in the development of increasingly capable AI systems is to
make them safe and reliable by ensuring their behaviour is consistent with
human values. This challenge, known as the alignment problem, does not merely
apply to hypothetical future AI systems that may pose catastrophic risks; it
already applies to current systems, such as large language models, whose
potential for harm is rapidly increasing. In this paper, I assess whether we
are on track to solve the alignment problem for large language models, and what
that means for the safety of future AI systems. I argue that existing
strategies for alignment are insufficient, because large language models remain
vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can reliably elicit unsafe behaviour. I
offer an explanation of this lingering vulnerability on which it is not simply
a contingent limitation of current language models, but has deep technical ties
to a crucial aspect of what makes these models useful and versatile in the
first place -- namely, their remarkable aptitude to learn &quot;in context&quot; directly
from user instructions. It follows that the alignment problem is not only
unsolved for current AI systems, but may be intrinsically difficult to solve
without severely undermining their capabilities. Furthermore, this assessment
raises concerns about the prospect of ensuring the safety of future and more
capable AI systems.

<title>Emergence of Abstract State Representations in Embodied Sequence Modeling. (arXiv:2311.02171v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02171</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Decision making via sequence modeling aims to mimic the success of language
models, where actions taken by an embodied agent are modeled as tokens to
predict. Despite their promising performance, it remains unclear if embodied
sequence modeling leads to the emergence of internal representations that
represent the environmental state information. A model that lacks abstract
state representations would be liable to make decisions based on surface
statistics which fail to generalize. We take the BabyAI environment, a grid
world in which language-conditioned navigation tasks are performed, and build a
sequence modeling Transformer, which takes a language instruction, a sequence
of actions, and environmental observations as its inputs. In order to
investigate the emergence of abstract state representations, we design a
&quot;blindfolded&quot; navigation task, where only the initial environmental layout, the
language instruction, and the action sequence to complete the task are
available for training. Our probing results show that intermediate
environmental layouts can be reasonably reconstructed from the internal
activations of a trained model, and that language instructions play a role in
the reconstruction accuracy. Our results suggest that many key features of
state representations can emerge via embodied sequence modeling, supporting an
optimistic outlook for applications of sequence modeling objectives to more
complex embodied decision-making domains.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Identifying contextual integrity (CI) and governing knowledge commons (GKC)

of privacy policies can be performed automatically using large language models.
We fine-tune 18 open-source and proprietary models on 21,588 GKC-CI annotations
from 16 ground truth privacy policies. Our best-performing model (fine-tuned
GPT-3.5 Turbo with prompt engineering) has an accuracy of 86%, exceeding the
performance of prior crowdsourcing approaches despite the complexity of privacy
policy texts and the nuance of the GKC-CI annotation task. We apply our
best-performing model to privacy policies from 164 popular online services,
demonstrating the effectiveness of scaling GKC-CI annotation for data
exploration. We make all annotated policies as well as the training data and

<title>AlberDICE: Addressing Out-Of-Distribution Joint Actions in Offline Multi-Agent RL via Alternating Stationary Distribution Correction Estimation. (arXiv:2311.02194v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02194</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;One of the main challenges in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) is the
distribution shift that arises from the learned policy deviating from the data
collection policy. This is often addressed by avoiding out-of-distribution
(OOD) actions during policy improvement as their presence can lead to
substantial performance degradation. This challenge is amplified in the offline
Multi-Agent RL (MARL) setting since the joint action space grows exponentially
with the number of agents. To avoid this curse of dimensionality, existing MARL
methods adopt either value decomposition methods or fully decentralized
training of individual agents. However, even when combined with standard
conservatism principles, these methods can still result in the selection of OOD
joint actions in offline MARL. To this end, we introduce AlberDICE, an offline
MARL algorithm that alternatively performs centralized training of individual
agents based on stationary distribution optimization. AlberDICE circumvents the
exponential complexity of MARL by computing the best response of one agent at a
time while effectively avoiding OOD joint action selection. Theoretically, we
show that the alternating optimization procedure converges to Nash policies. In
the experiments, we demonstrate that AlberDICE significantly outperforms
baseline algorithms on a standard suite of MARL benchmarks.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Despite the considerable potential of reinforcement learning (RL), robotics
control tasks predominantly rely on imitation learning (IL) owing to its better
sample efficiency. However, given the high cost of collecting extensive
demonstrations, RL is still appealing if it can utilize limited imitation data
for efficient autonomous self-improvement. Existing RL methods that utilize
demonstrations either initialize the replay buffer with demonstrations and
oversample them during RL training, which does not benefit from the
generalization potential of modern IL methods, or pretrain the RL policy with
IL on the demonstrations, which requires additional mechanisms to prevent
catastrophic forgetting during RL fine-tuning. We propose imitation
bootstrapped reinforcement learning (IBRL), a novel framework that first trains
an IL policy on a limited number of demonstrations and then uses it to propose
alternative actions for both online exploration and target value bootstrapping.
IBRL achieves SoTA performance and sample efficiency on 7 challenging sparse
reward continuous control tasks in simulation while learning directly from
pixels. As a highlight of our method, IBRL achieves $6.4\times$ higher success
rate than RLPD, a strong method that combines the idea of oversampling
demonstrations with modern RL improvements, under the budget of 10 demos and
100K interactions in the challenging PickPlaceCan task in the Robomimic

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a technique for sample-efficient black-box
optimization that employs probabilistic models to identify promising input
locations for evaluation. When dealing with composite-structured functions,
such as f=g o h, evaluating a specific location x yields observations of both
the final outcome f(x) = g(h(x)) as well as the intermediate output(s) h(x).
Previous research has shown that integrating information from these
intermediate outputs can enhance BO performance substantially. However,
existing methods struggle if the outputs h(x) are high-dimensional. Many
relevant problems fall into this setting, including in the context of
generative AI, molecular design, or robotics. To effectively tackle these
challenges, we introduce Joint Composite Latent Space Bayesian Optimization
(JoCo), a novel framework that jointly trains neural network encoders and
probabilistic models to adaptively compress high-dimensional input and output
spaces into manageable latent representations. This enables viable BO on these
compressed representations, allowing JoCo to outperform other state-of-the-art

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02215</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms exhibit broad generality
in their theoretical formulation and high performance on several challenging
domains when combined with powerful function approximation. However, developing
RL algorithms that perform well across problems with unstructured observations
at scale remains challenging because most function approximation methods rely
on externally provisioned knowledge about the structure of the input for good
performance (e.g. convolutional networks, graph neural networks, tile-coding).
A common practice in RL is to evaluate algorithms on a single problem, or on
problems with limited variation in the observation scale. RL practitioners lack
a systematic way to study how well a single RL algorithm performs when
instantiated across a range of problem scales, and they lack function
approximation techniques that scale well with unstructured observations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We address these limitations by providing environments and algorithms to
study scaling for unstructured observation vectors and flat action spaces. We
introduce a family of combinatorial RL problems with an exponentially large
state space and high-dimensional dynamics but where linear computation is
sufficient to learn a (nonlinear) value function estimate for performant
control. We provide an algorithm that constructs reward-relevant general value
function (GVF) questions to find and exploit predictive structure directly from
the experience stream. In an empirical evaluation of the approach on synthetic
problems, we observe a sample complexity that scales linearly with the
observation size. The proposed algorithm reliably outperforms a conventional
deep RL algorithm on these scaling problems, and they exhibit several desirable
auxiliary properties. These results suggest new algorithmic mechanisms by which
algorithms can learn at scale from unstructured data.

satisfy invariances with respect to subsets of inputs. For instance, when
learning generative models using neural networks, it is advantageous to encode
the conditional independence structure of observed variables, often in the form
of Bayesian networks. We propose the Structured Neural Network (StrNN), which
injects structure through masking pathways in a neural network. The masks are
designed via a novel relationship we explore between neural network
architectures and binary matrix factorization, to ensure that the desired
independencies are respected. We devise and study practical algorithms for this
otherwise NP-hard design problem based on novel objectives that control the
model architecture. We demonstrate the utility of StrNN in three applications:
(1) binary and Gaussian density estimation with StrNN, (2) real-valued density
estimation with Structured Autoregressive Flows (StrAFs) and Structured
Continuous Normalizing Flows (StrCNF), and (3) interventional and
counterfactual analysis with StrAFs for causal inference. Our work opens up new
avenues for learning neural networks that enable data-efficient generative

<title>State-wise Safe Reinforcement Learning With Pixel Observations. (arXiv:2311.02227v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02227</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement Learning(RL) in the context of safe exploration has long
grappled with the challenges of the delicate balance between maximizing rewards
and minimizing safety violations, the complexities arising from contact-rich or
non-smooth environments, and high-dimensional pixel observations. Furthermore,
incorporating state-wise safety constraints in the exploration and learning
process, where the agent is prohibited from accessing unsafe regions without
prior knowledge, adds an additional layer of complexity. In this paper, we
propose a novel pixel-observation safe RL algorithm that efficiently encodes
state-wise safety constraints with unknown hazard regions through the
introduction of a latent barrier function learning mechanism. As a joint
learning framework, our approach first involves constructing a latent dynamics
model with low-dimensional latent spaces derived from pixel observations.
Subsequently, we build and learn a latent barrier function on top of the latent
dynamics and conduct policy optimization simultaneously, thereby improving both
safety and the total expected return. Experimental evaluations on the
safety-gym benchmark suite demonstrate that our proposed method significantly
reduces safety violations throughout the training process and demonstrates
faster safety convergence compared to existing methods while achieving
competitive results in reward return.

<title>Robust Fine-Tuning of Vision-Language Models for Domain Generalization. (arXiv:2311.02236v1 [cs.CV])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02236</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Transfer learning enables the sharing of common knowledge among models for a
variety of downstream tasks, but traditional methods suffer in limited training
data settings and produce narrow models incapable of effectively generalizing
under distribution shifts. Foundation models have recently demonstrated
impressive zero-shot inference capabilities and robustness under distribution
shifts. However, zero-shot evaluation for these models has been predominantly
confined to benchmarks with simple distribution shifts, limiting our
understanding of their effectiveness under the more realistic shifts found in
practice. Moreover, common fine-tuning methods for these models have yet to be
evaluated against vision models in few-shot scenarios where training data is
limited. To address these gaps, we present a new recipe for few-shot
fine-tuning of the popular vision-language foundation model CLIP and evaluate
its performance on challenging benchmark datasets with realistic distribution
shifts from the WILDS collection. Our experimentation demonstrates that, while
zero-shot CLIP fails to match performance of trained vision models on more
complex benchmarks, few-shot CLIP fine-tuning outperforms its vision-only
counterparts in terms of in-distribution and out-of-distribution accuracy at
all levels of training data availability. This provides a strong incentive for
adoption of foundation models within few-shot learning applications operating
with real-world data. Code is available at

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02237</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;While a substantial amount of work has recently been devoted to enhance the
performance of computational Authorship Identification (AId) systems, little to
no attention has been paid to endowing AId systems with the ability to explain
the reasons behind their predictions. This lacking substantially hinders the
practical employment of AId methodologies, since the predictions returned by
such systems are hardly useful unless they are supported with suitable
explanations. In this paper, we explore the applicability of existing
general-purpose eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to AId,
with a special focus on explanations addressed to scholars working in cultural
heritage. In particular, we assess the relative merits of three different types
of XAI techniques (feature ranking, probing, factuals and counterfactual
selection) on three different AId tasks (authorship attribution, authorship
verification, same-authorship verification) by running experiments on real AId
data. Our analysis shows that, while these techniques make important first
steps towards explainable Authorship Identification, more work remains to be
done in order to provide tools that can be profitably integrated in the
workflows of scholars.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a novel supervised convolutional neural network

augmentation techniques to enrich the training set, thus increasing our model&apos;s

segmentation tasks, in this study, we demonstrate its capabilities specifically
for polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images. We evaluate the performance of
our method on several popular benchmark datasets for polyp segmentation,
Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, and ETIS-LARIBPOLYPDB showing that it

<title>Equal Opportunity of Coverage in Fair Regression. (arXiv:2311.02243v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02243</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We study fair machine learning (ML) under predictive uncertainty to enable
reliable and trustworthy decision-making. The seminal work of ``equalized
coverage&apos;&apos; proposed an uncertainty-aware fairness notion. However, it does not
guarantee equal coverage rates across more fine-grained groups (e.g.,
low-income females) conditioning on the true label and is biased in the
assessment of uncertainty. To tackle these limitations, we propose a new
uncertainty-aware fairness -- Equal Opportunity of Coverage (EOC) -- that aims
to achieve two properties: (1) coverage rates for different groups with similar
outcomes are close, and (2) the coverage rate for the entire population remains
at a predetermined level. Further, the prediction intervals should be narrow to
be informative. We propose Binned Fair Quantile Regression (BFQR), a
distribution-free post-processing method to improve EOC with reasonable width
for any trained ML models. It first calibrates a hold-out set to bound
deviation from EOC, then leverages conformal prediction to maintain EOC on a
test set, meanwhile optimizing prediction interval width. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving EOC. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/fangxin-wang/bfqr .

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Scene graphs have emerged as accurate descriptive priors for image generation
and manipulation tasks, however, their complexity and diversity of the shapes
and relations of objects in data make it challenging to incorporate them into
the models and generate high-quality results. To address these challenges, we
propose PRISM, a novel progressive multi-head image manipulation approach to
improve the accuracy and quality of the manipulated regions in the scene. Our
image manipulation framework is trained using an end-to-end denoising masked
reconstruction proxy task, where the masked regions are progressively unmasked
from the outer regions to the inner part. We take advantage of the outer part
of the masked area as they have a direct correlation with the context of the
scene. Moreover, our multi-head architecture simultaneously generates detailed
object-specific regions in addition to the entire image to produce
higher-quality images. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in
the semantic image manipulation task on the CLEVR and Visual Genome datasets.
Our results demonstrate the potential of our approach for enhancing the quality
and precision of scene graph-based image manipulation.

<title>The Potential of Wearable Sensors for Assessing Patient Acuity in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). (arXiv:2311.02251v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02251</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Acuity assessments are vital in critical care settings to provide timely
interventions and fair resource allocation. Traditional acuity scores rely on
manual assessments and documentation of physiological states, which can be
time-consuming, intermittent, and difficult to use for healthcare providers.
Furthermore, such scores do not incorporate granular information such as
patients&apos; mobility level, which can indicate recovery or deterioration in the
ICU. We hypothesized that existing acuity scores could be potentially improved
by employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in conjunction with
Electronic Health Records (EHR) and wearable sensor data. In this study, we
evaluated the impact of integrating mobility data collected from wrist-worn
accelerometers with clinical data obtained from EHR for developing an AI-driven
acuity assessment score. Accelerometry data were collected from 86 patients
wearing accelerometers on their wrists in an academic hospital setting. The
data was analyzed using five deep neural network models: VGG, ResNet,
MobileNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Transformer network. These models
outperformed a rule-based clinical score (SOFA= Sequential Organ Failure
Assessment) used as a baseline, particularly regarding the precision,
sensitivity, and F1 score. The results showed that while a model relying solely
on accelerometer data achieved limited performance (AUC 0.50, Precision 0.61,
and F1-score 0.68), including demographic information with the accelerometer
data led to a notable enhancement in performance (AUC 0.69, Precision 0.75, and
F1-score 0.67). This work shows that the combination of mobility and patient
information can successfully differentiate between stable and unstable states
in critically ill patients.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02253</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In the era of large scale pretrained models, Knowledge Distillation (KD)
serves an important role in transferring the wisdom of computationally heavy
teacher models to lightweight, efficient student models while preserving
performance. Traditional KD paradigms, however, assume readily available access
to teacher models for frequent inference -- a notion increasingly at odds with
the realities of costly, often proprietary, large scale models. Addressing this
gap, our paper considers how to minimize the dependency on teacher model
inferences in KD in a setting we term Few Teacher Inference Knowledge
Distillation (FTI KD). We observe that prevalent KD techniques and state of the
art data augmentation strategies fall short in this constrained setting.
Drawing inspiration from educational principles that emphasize learning through
comparison, we propose Comparative Knowledge Distillation (CKD), which
encourages student models to understand the nuanced differences in a teacher
model&apos;s interpretations of samples. Critically, CKD provides additional
learning signals to the student without making additional teacher calls. We
also extend the principle of CKD to groups of samples, enabling even more
efficient learning from limited teacher calls. Empirical evaluation across
varied experimental settings indicates that CKD consistently outperforms state
of the art data augmentation and KD techniques.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Neurons can display highly variable dynamics. While such variability
presumably supports the wide range of behaviors generated by the organism,
their gene expressions are relatively stable in the adult brain. This suggests
that neuronal activity is a combination of its time-invariant identity and the
inputs the neuron receives from the rest of the circuit. Here, we propose a
self-supervised learning based method to assign time-invariant representations
to individual neurons based on permutation-, and population size-invariant
summary of population recordings. We fit dynamical models to neuronal activity
to learn a representation by considering the activity of both the individual
and the neighboring population. Our self-supervised approach and use of
implicit representations enable robust inference against imperfections such as
partial overlap of neurons across sessions, trial-to-trial variability, and
limited availability of molecular (transcriptomic) labels for downstream
supervised tasks. We demonstrate our method on a public multimodal dataset of
mouse cortical neuronal activity and transcriptomic labels. We report &amp;gt; 35%
improvement in predicting the transcriptomic subclass identity and &amp;gt; 20%
improvement in predicting class identity with respect to the state-of-the-art.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02262</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In human-written articles, we often leverage the subtleties of text style,
such as bold and italics, to guide the attention of readers. These textual
emphases are vital for the readers to grasp the conveyed information. When
interacting with large language models (LLMs), we have a similar need -
steering the model to pay closer attention to user-specified information, e.g.,
an instruction. Existing methods, however, are constrained to process plain
text and do not support such a mechanism. This motivates us to introduce PASTA
- Post-hoc Attention STeering Approach, a method that allows LLMs to read text
with user-specified emphasis marks. To this end, PASTA identifies a small
subset of attention heads and applies precise attention reweighting on them,
directing the model attention to user-specified parts. Like prompting, PASTA is
applied at inference time and does not require changing any model parameters.
Experiments demonstrate that PASTA can substantially enhance an LLM&apos;s ability
to follow user instructions or integrate new knowledge from user inputs,
leading to a significant performance improvement on a variety of tasks, e.g.,
an average accuracy improvement of 22% for LLAMA-7B. Our code is publicly

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02266</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) is a non-invasive imaging
technique that provides high-resolution cross-sectional images of the retina,
which are useful for diagnosing and monitoring various retinal diseases.
However, manual segmentation of OCTA images is a time-consuming and
labor-intensive task, which motivates the development of automated segmentation
methods. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task learning method for OCTA
segmentation, called OCTA-MTL, that leverages an image-to-DT (Distance
Transform) branch and an adaptive loss combination strategy. The image-to-DT
branch predicts the distance from each vessel voxel to the vessel surface,
which can provide useful shape prior and boundary information for the
segmentation task. The adaptive loss combination strategy dynamically adjusts
the loss weights according to the inverse of the average loss values of each
task, to balance the learning process and avoid the dominance of one task over
the other. We evaluate our method on the ROSE-2 dataset its superiority in
terms of segmentation performance against two baseline methods: a single-task
segmentation method and a multi-task segmentation method with a fixed loss
combination.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Contextual bandits have emerged as a cornerstone in reinforcement learning,
enabling systems to make decisions with partial feedback. However, as contexts
grow in complexity, traditional bandit algorithms can face challenges in
adequately capturing and utilizing such contexts. In this paper, we propose a
novel integration of large language models (LLMs) with the contextual bandit
framework. By leveraging LLMs as an encoder, we enrich the representation of
the context, providing the bandit with a denser and more informative view.
Preliminary results on synthetic datasets demonstrate the potential of this
approach, showing notable improvements in cumulative rewards and reductions in
regret compared to traditional bandit algorithms. This integration not only
showcases the capabilities of LLMs in reinforcement learning but also opens the
door to a new era of contextually-aware decision systems.

<title>Regularized Linear Regression for Binary Classification. (arXiv:2311.02270v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02270</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Regularized linear regression is a promising approach for binary
classification problems in which the training set has noisy labels since the
regularization term can help to avoid interpolating the mislabeled data points.
In this paper we provide a systematic study of the effects of the
regularization strength on the performance of linear classifiers that are
trained to solve binary classification problems by minimizing a regularized
least-squares objective. We consider the over-parametrized regime and assume
that the classes are generated from a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) where a
fraction $c&amp;lt;\frac{1}{2}$ of the training data is mislabeled. Under these
assumptions, we rigorously analyze the classification errors resulting from the
application of ridge, $\ell_1$, and $\ell_\infty$ regression. In particular, we
demonstrate that ridge regression invariably improves the classification error.
We prove that $\ell_1$ regularization induces sparsity and observe that in many
cases one can sparsify the solution by up to two orders of magnitude without
any considerable loss of performance, even though the GMM has no underlying
sparsity structure. For $\ell_\infty$ regularization we show that, for large
enough regularization strength, the optimal weights concentrate around two
values of opposite sign. We observe that in many cases the corresponding
&quot;compression&quot; of each weight to a single bit leads to very little loss in
performance. These latter observations can have significant practical
ramifications.

<title>Contrastive Multi-Modal Representation Learning for Spark Plug Fault Diagnosis. (arXiv:2311.02282v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02282</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Due to the incapability of one sensory measurement to provide enough
information for condition monitoring of some complex engineered industrial
mechanisms and also for overcoming the misleading noise of a single sensor,
multiple sensors are installed to improve the condition monitoring of some
industrial equipment. Therefore, an efficient data fusion strategy is demanded.
In this research, we presented a Denoising Multi-Modal Autoencoder with a
unique training strategy based on contrastive learning paradigm, both being
utilized for the first time in the machine health monitoring realm. The
presented approach, which leverages the merits of both supervised and
unsupervised learning, not only achieves excellent performance in fusing
multiple modalities (or views) of data into an enriched common representation
but also takes data fusion to the next level wherein one of the views can be
omitted during inference time with very slight performance reduction, or even
without any reduction at all. The presented methodology enables multi-modal
fault diagnosis systems to perform more robustly in case of sensor failure
occurrence, and one can also intentionally omit one of the sensors (the more
expensive one) in order to build a more cost-effective condition monitoring
system without sacrificing performance for practical purposes. The
effectiveness of the presented methodology is examined on a real-world private
multi-modal dataset gathered under non-laboratory conditions from a complex
engineered mechanism, an inline four-stroke spark-ignition engine, aiming for
spark plug fault diagnosis. This dataset, which contains the accelerometer and
acoustic signals as two modalities, has a very slight amount of fault, and
achieving good performance on such a dataset promises that the presented method
can perform well on other equipment as well.

<title>Predicting Ground Reaction Force from Inertial Sensors. (arXiv:2311.02287v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02287</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The study of ground reaction forces (GRF) is used to characterize the
mechanical loading experienced by individuals in movements such as running,
which is clinically applicable to identify athletes at risk for stress-related
injuries. Our aim in this paper is to determine if data collected with inertial
measurement units (IMUs), that can be worn by athletes during outdoor runs, can
be used to predict GRF with sufficient accuracy to allow the analysis of its
derived biomechanical variables (e.g., contact time and loading rate).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we consider lightweight approaches in contrast to
state-of-the-art prediction using LSTM neural networks. Specifically, we
compare use of LSTMs to k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression as well as propose
a novel solution, SVD Embedding Regression (SER), using linear regression
between singular value decomposition embeddings of IMUs data (input) and GRF
data (output). We evaluate the accuracy of these techniques when using training
data collected from different athletes, from the same athlete, or both, and we
explore the use of acceleration and angular velocity data from sensors at
different locations (sacrum and shanks). Our results illustrate that simple
machine learning methods such as SER and KNN can be similarly accurate or more
accurate than LSTM neural networks, with much faster training times and
hyperparameter optimization; in particular, SER and KNN are more accurate when
personal training data are available, and KNN comes with benefit of providing
provenance of prediction. Notably, the use of personal data reduces prediction
errors of all methods for most biomechanical variables.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02300</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Meta learning is a promising technique for solving few-shot fault prediction
problems, which have attracted the attention of many researchers in recent
years. Existing meta-learning methods for time series prediction, which
predominantly rely on random and similarity matching-based task partitioning,
face three major limitations: (1) feature exploitation inefficiency; (2)
suboptimal task data allocation; and (3) limited robustness with small samples.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel &apos;pseudo meta-task&apos;
partitioning scheme that treats a continuous time period of a time series as a
meta-task, composed of multiple successive short time periods. Employing
continuous time series as pseudo meta-tasks allows our method to extract more
comprehensive features and relationships from the data, resulting in more
accurate predictions. Moreover, we introduce a differential algorithm to
enhance the robustness of our method across different datasets. Through
extensive experiments on several fault and time series prediction datasets, we
demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances prediction performance and
generalization capability under both few-shot and general conditions.

<title>MFTCoder: Boosting Code LLMs with Multitask Fine-Tuning. (arXiv:2311.02303v1 [cs.LG])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02303</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Code LLMs have emerged as a specialized research field, with remarkable
studies dedicated to enhancing model&apos;s coding capabilities through fine-tuning
on pre-trained models. Previous fine-tuning approaches were typically tailored
to specific downstream tasks or scenarios, which meant separate fine-tuning for
each task, requiring extensive training resources and posing challenges in
terms of deployment and maintenance. Furthermore, these approaches failed to
leverage the inherent interconnectedness among different code-related tasks. To
overcome these limitations, we present a multi-task fine-tuning framework,
MFTcoder, that enables simultaneous and parallel fine-tuning on multiple tasks.
By incorporating various loss functions, we effectively address common
challenges in multi-task learning, such as data imbalance, varying difficulty
levels, and inconsistent convergence speeds. Extensive experiments have
conclusively demonstrated that our multi-task fine-tuning approach outperforms
both individual fine-tuning on single tasks and fine-tuning on a mixed ensemble
of tasks. Moreover, MFTcoder offers efficient training capabilities, including
efficient data tokenization modes and PEFT fine-tuning, resulting in
significantly improved speed compared to traditional fine-tuning methods.
MFTcoder seamlessly integrates with several mainstream open-source LLMs, such
as CodeLLama and Qwen. Leveraging the CodeLLama foundation, our MFTcoder
fine-tuned model, \textsc{CodeFuse-CodeLLama-34B}, achieves an impressive
pass@1 score of 74.4\% on the HumaneEval benchmark, surpassing GPT-4
performance (67\%, zero-shot). MFTCoder is open-sourced at

<title>Heteroskedastic Tensor Clustering. (arXiv:2311.02306v1 [math.ST])</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02306</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Tensor clustering, which seeks to extract underlying cluster structures from
noisy tensor observations, has gained increasing attention. One extensively
studied model for tensor clustering is the tensor block model, which postulates
the existence of clustering structures along each mode and has found broad
applications in areas like multi-tissue gene expression analysis and multilayer
network analysis. However, currently available computationally feasible methods
for tensor clustering either are limited to handling i.i.d. sub-Gaussian noise
or suffer from suboptimal statistical performance, which restrains their
utility in applications that have to deal with heteroskedastic data and/or low
signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome these challenges, we propose a two-stage method, named
$\mathsf{High\text{-}order~HeteroClustering}$ ($\mathsf{HHC}$), which starts by
performing tensor subspace estimation via a novel spectral algorithm called
$\mathsf{Thresholded~Deflated\text{-}HeteroPCA}$, followed by approximate
$k$-means to obtain cluster nodes. Encouragingly, our algorithm provably
achieves exact clustering as long as the SNR exceeds the computational limit
(ignoring logarithmic factors); here, the SNR refers to the ratio of the
pairwise disparity between nodes to the noise level, and the computational
limit indicates the lowest SNR that enables exact clustering with polynomial
runtime. Comprehensive simulation and real-data experiments suggest that our
algorithm outperforms existing algorithms across various settings, delivering
more reliable clustering performance.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02316</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;To solve the spatial problems of mapping, localization and navigation, the
mammalian lineage has developed striking spatial representations. One important
spatial representation is the Nobel-prize winning grid cells: neurons that
represent self-location, a local and aperiodic quantity, with seemingly bizarre
non-local and spatially periodic activity patterns of a few discrete periods.
Why has the mammalian lineage learnt this peculiar grid representation?
Mathematical analysis suggests that this multi-periodic representation has
excellent properties as an algebraic code with high capacity and intrinsic
error-correction, but to date, there is no satisfactory synthesis of core
principles that lead to multi-modular grid cells in deep recurrent neural
networks. In this work, we begin by identifying key insights from four families
of approaches to answering the grid cell question: coding theory, dynamical
systems, function optimization and supervised deep learning. We then leverage
our insights to propose a new approach that combines the strengths of all four
approaches. Our approach is a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework -
including data, data augmentations, loss functions and a network architecture -
motivated from a normative perspective, without access to supervised position
information or engineering of particular readout representations as needed in
previous approaches. We show that multiple grid cell modules can emerge in
networks trained on our SSL framework and that the networks and emergent
representations generalize well outside their training distribution. This work
contains insights for neuroscientists interested in the origins of grid cells
as well as machine learning researchers interested in novel SSL frameworks.

challenges persist in achieving model interpretability and optimizing
performance. We propose a novel transformer-based model, FragXsiteDTI, that

the first DTI model to simultaneously leverage drug molecule fragments and
protein pockets. Our information-rich representations for both proteins and
drugs offer a detailed perspective on their interaction. Inspired by the
Perceiver IO framework, our model features a learnable latent array, initially
interacting with protein binding site embeddings using cross-attention and
later refined through self-attention and used as a query to the drug fragments
in the drug&apos;s cross-attention transformer block. This learnable query array
serves as a mediator and enables seamless information translation, preserving
critical nuances in drug-protein interactions. Our computational results on
three benchmarking datasets demonstrate the superior predictive power of our
model over several state-of-the-art models. We also show the interpretability
of our model in terms of the critical components of both target proteins and

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In numerous contexts, high-resolution solutions to partial differential
equations are required to capture faithfully essential dynamics which occur at
small spatiotemporal scales, but these solutions can be very difficult and slow
to obtain using traditional methods due to limited computational resources. A
recent direction to circumvent these computational limitations is to use
machine learning techniques for super-resolution, to reconstruct
high-resolution numerical solutions from low-resolution simulations which can
be obtained more efficiently. The proposed approach, the Super Resolution
Operator Network (SROpNet), frames super-resolution as an operator learning
problem and draws inspiration from existing architectures to learn continuous
representations of solutions to parametric differential equations from
low-resolution approximations, which can then be evaluated at any desired
location. In addition, no restrictions are imposed on the locations of (the
fixed number of) spatiotemporal sensors at which the low-resolution
approximations are provided, thereby enabling the consideration of a broader
spectrum of problems arising in practice, for which many existing
super-resolution approaches are not well-suited.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12622</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The overestimation phenomenon caused by function approximation is a
well-known issue in value-based reinforcement learning algorithms such as deep
Q-networks and DDPG, which could lead to suboptimal policies. To address this
issue, TD3 takes the minimum value between a pair of critics. In this paper, we
show that the TD3 algorithm introduces underestimation bias in mild
assumptions. To obtain a more precise estimation for value function, we unify
these two opposites and propose a novel algorithm \underline{W}eighted
\underline{D}elayed \underline{D}eep \underline{D}eterministic Policy Gradient
(WD3), which can eliminate the estimation bias and further improve the
performance by weighting a pair of critics. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
WD3, we compare the learning process of value function between DDPG, TD3, and
WD3. The results verify that our algorithm does eliminate the estimation error
of value functions. Furthermore, we evaluate our algorithm on the continuous
control tasks. We observe that in each test task, the performance of WD3
consistently outperforms, or at the very least matches, that of the

<title>ProtoryNet - Interpretable Text Classification Via Prototype Trajectories. (arXiv:2007.01777v5 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01777</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We propose a novel interpretable deep neural network for text classification,
called ProtoryNet, based on a new concept of prototype trajectories. Motivated
by the prototype theory in modern linguistics, ProtoryNet makes a prediction by
finding the most similar prototype for each sentence in a text sequence and
feeding an RNN backbone with the proximity of each sentence to the
corresponding active prototype. The RNN backbone then captures the temporal
pattern of the prototypes, which we refer to as prototype trajectories.
Prototype trajectories enable intuitive and fine-grained interpretation of the
reasoning process of the RNN model, in resemblance to how humans analyze texts.
We also design a prototype pruning procedure to reduce the total number of
prototypes used by the model for better interpretability. Experiments on
multiple public data sets show that ProtoryNet is more accurate than the
baseline prototype-based deep neural net and reduces the performance gap
compared to state-of-the-art black-box models. In addition, after prototype
pruning, the resulting ProtoryNet models only need less than or around 20
prototypes for all datasets, which significantly benefits interpretability.
Furthermore, we report a survey result indicating that human users find
ProtoryNet more intuitive and easier to understand than other prototype-based
methods.

<title>Training Matters: Unlocking Potentials of Deeper Graph Convolutional Neural Networks. (arXiv:2008.08838v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08838</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The performance limit of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and the fact
that we cannot stack more of them to increase the performance, which we usually
do for other deep learning paradigms, are pervasively thought to be caused by
the limitations of the GCN layers, including insufficient expressive power,
etc. However, if so, for a fixed architecture, it would be unlikely to lower
the training difficulty and to improve performance by changing only the
training procedure, which we show in this paper not only possible but possible
in several ways. This paper first identify the training difficulty of GCNs from
the perspective of graph signal energy loss. More specifically, we find that
the loss of energy in the backward pass during training nullifies the learning
of the layers closer to the input. Then, we propose several methodologies to
mitigate the training problem by slightly modifying the GCN operator, from the
energy perspective. After empirical validation, we confirm that these changes
of operator lead to significant decrease in the training difficulties and
notable performance boost, without changing the composition of parameters. With
these, we conclude that the root cause of the problem is more likely the
training difficulty than the others.

<title>A New Bandit Setting Balancing Information from State Evolution and Corrupted Context. (arXiv:2011.07989v4 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07989</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We propose a new sequential decision-making setting, combining key aspects of
two established online learning problems with bandit feedback. The optimal
action to play at any given moment is contingent on an underlying changing
state which is not directly observable by the agent. Each state is associated
with a context distribution, possibly corrupted, allowing the agent to identify
the state. Furthermore, states evolve in a Markovian fashion, providing useful
information to estimate the current state via state history. In the proposed
problem setting, we tackle the challenge of deciding on which of the two
sources of information the agent should base its arm selection. We present an
algorithm that uses a referee to dynamically combine the policies of a
contextual bandit and a multi-armed bandit. We capture the time-correlation of
states through iteratively learning the action-reward transition model,
allowing for efficient exploration of actions. Our setting is motivated by
adaptive mobile health (mHealth) interventions. Users transition through
different, time-correlated, but only partially observable internal states,
determining their current needs. The side information associated with each
internal state might not always be reliable, and standard approaches solely
rely on the context risk of incurring high regret. Similarly, some users might
exhibit weaker correlations between subsequent states, leading to approaches
that solely rely on state transitions risking the same. We analyze our setting
and algorithm in terms of regret lower bound and upper bounds and evaluate our
method on simulated medication adherence intervention data and several
real-world data sets, showing improved empirical performance compared to
several popular algorithms.

<title>Using reinforcement learning to autonomously identify sources of error for agents in group missions. (arXiv:2107.09232v4 [cs.RO] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09232</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;When agents swarm to execute a mission, some of them frequently exhibit
sudden failure, as observed from the command base. It is generally difficult to
determine whether a failure is caused by actuators (hypothesis, $h_a$) or
sensors (hypothesis, $h_s$) by solely relying on the communication between the
command base and concerning agent. However, by instigating collusion between
the agents, the cause of failure can be identified; in other words, we expect
to detect corresponding displacements for $h_a$ but not for $h_s$. In this
study, we considered the question as to whether artificial intelligence can
autonomously generate an action plan $\boldsymbol{g}$ to pinpoint the cause as
aforedescribed. Because the expected response to $\boldsymbol{g}$ generally
depends upon the adopted hypothesis [let the difference be denoted by
$D(\boldsymbol{g})$], a formulation that uses $D\left(\boldsymbol{g}\right)$ to
pinpoint the cause can be made. Although a $\boldsymbol{g}^*$ that maximizes
$D(\boldsymbol{g})$ would be a suitable action plan for this task, such an
optimization is difficult to achieve using the conventional gradient method, as
$D(\boldsymbol{g})$ becomes nonzero in rare events such as collisions with
other agents, and most swarm actions $\boldsymbol{g}$ give
$D(\boldsymbol{g})=0$. In other words, throughout almost the entire space of
$\boldsymbol{g}$, $D(\boldsymbol{g})$ has zero gradient, and the gradient
method is not applicable. To overcome this problem, we formulated an action
plan using Q-table reinforcement learning. Surprisingly, the optimal action
plan generated via reinforcement learning presented a human-like solution to
pinpoint the problem by colliding other agents with the failed agent. Using
this simple prototype, we demonstrated the potential of applying Q-table
reinforcement learning methods to plan autonomous actions to pinpoint the
causes of failure.

<title>New Insights into Graph Convolutional Networks using Neural Tangent Kernels. (arXiv:2110.04060v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04060</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have emerged as powerful tools for
learning on network structured data. Although empirically successful, GCNs
exhibit certain behaviour that has no rigorous explanation -- for instance, the
performance of GCNs significantly degrades with increasing network depth,
whereas it improves marginally with depth using skip connections. This paper
focuses on semi-supervised learning on graphs, and explains the above
observations through the lens of Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs). We derive NTKs
corresponding to infinitely wide GCNs (with and without skip connections).
Subsequently, we use the derived NTKs to identify that, with suitable
normalisation, network depth does not always drastically reduce the performance
of GCNs -- a fact that we also validate through extensive simulation.
Furthermore, we propose NTK as an efficient `surrogate model&apos; for GCNs that
does not suffer from performance fluctuations due to hyper-parameter tuning
since it is a hyper-parameter free deterministic kernel. The efficacy of this
idea is demonstrated through a comparison of different skip connections for
GCNs using the surrogate NTKs.

<title>Error-bounded Approximate Time Series Joins Using Compact Dictionary Representations of Time Series. (arXiv:2112.12965v2 [cs.DB] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12965</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The matrix profile is an effective data mining tool that provides similarity
join functionality for time series data. Users of the matrix profile can either
join a time series with itself using intra-similarity join (i.e., self-join) or
join a time series with another time series using inter-similarity join. By
invoking either or both types of joins, the matrix profile can help users
discover both conserved and anomalous structures in the data. Since the
introduction of the matrix profile five years ago, multiple efforts have been
made to speed up the computation with approximate joins; however, the majority
of these efforts only focus on self-joins. In this work, we show that it is
possible to efficiently perform approximate inter-time series similarity joins
with error bounded guarantees by creating a compact &quot;dictionary&quot; representation
of time series. Using the dictionary representation instead of the original
time series, we are able to improve the throughput of an anomaly mining system
by at least 20X, with essentially no decrease in accuracy. As a side effect,
the dictionaries also summarize the time series in a semantically meaningful
way and can provide intuitive and actionable insights. We demonstrate the
utility of our dictionary-based inter-time series similarity joins on domains
as diverse as medicine and transportation.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05069</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;With the development of new sensors and monitoring devices, more sources of
data become available to be used as inputs for machine learning models. These
can on the one hand help to improve the accuracy of a model. On the other hand,
combining these new inputs with historical data remains a challenge that has
not yet been studied in enough detail. In this work, we propose a transfer
learning algorithm that combines new and historical data with different input
dimensions. This approach is easy to implement, efficient, with computational
complexity equivalent to the ordinary least-squares method, and requires no
hyperparameter tuning, making it straightforward to apply when the new data is
limited. Different from other approaches, we provide a rigorous theoretical
study of its robustness, showing that it cannot be outperformed by a baseline
that utilizes only the new data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on 9 real-life datasets, outperforming the linear DSFT, another
linear transfer learning algorithm, and performing comparably to non-linear
DSFT.

<title>Monotone Learning. (arXiv:2202.05246v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05246</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The amount of training-data is one of the key factors which determines the
generalization capacity of learning algorithms. Intuitively, one expects the
error rate to decrease as the amount of training-data increases. Perhaps
surprisingly, natural attempts to formalize this intuition give rise to
interesting and challenging mathematical questions. For example, in their
classical book on pattern recognition, Devroye, Gyorfi, and Lugosi (1996) ask
whether there exists a {monotone} Bayes-consistent algorithm. This question
remained open for over 25 years, until recently Pestov (2021) resolved it for
binary classification, using an intricate construction of a monotone
Bayes-consistent algorithm.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We derive a general result in multiclass classification, showing that every
learning algorithm A can be transformed to a monotone one with similar
performance. Further, the transformation is efficient and only uses a black-box
oracle access to A. This demonstrates that one can provably avoid non-monotonic
behaviour without compromising performance, thus answering questions asked by
Devroye et al (1996), Viering, Mey, and Loog (2019), Viering and Loog (2021),
and by Mhammedi (2021).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our transformation readily implies monotone learners in a variety of
contexts: for example it extends Pestov&apos;s result to classification tasks with
an arbitrary number of labels. This is in contrast with Pestov&apos;s work which is
tailored to binary classification.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we provide uniform bounds on the error of the monotone
algorithm. This makes our transformation applicable in distribution-free
settings. For example, in PAC learning it implies that every learnable class
admits a monotone PAC learner. This resolves questions by Viering, Mey, and
Loog (2019); Viering and Loog (2021); Mhammedi (2021).

<title>Understanding Curriculum Learning in Policy Optimization for Online Combinatorial Optimization. (arXiv:2202.05423v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05423</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Over the recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) starts to show promising
results in tackling combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, in particular
when coupled with curriculum learning to facilitate training. Despite emerging
empirical evidence, theoretical study on why RL helps is still at its early
stage. This paper presents the first systematic study on policy optimization
methods for online CO problems. We show that online CO problems can be
naturally formulated as latent Markov Decision Processes (LMDPs), and prove
convergence bounds on natural policy gradient (NPG) for solving LMDPs.
Furthermore, our theory explains the benefit of curriculum learning: it can
find a strong sampling policy and reduce the distribution shift, a critical
quantity that governs the convergence rate in our theorem. For a canonical
online CO problem, the Best Choice Problem (BCP), we formally prove that
distribution shift is reduced exponentially with curriculum learning even if
the curriculum is a randomly generated BCP on a smaller scale. Our theory also
shows we can simplify the curriculum learning scheme used in prior work from
multi-step to single-step. Lastly, we provide extensive experiments on the Best
Choice Problem, Online Knapsack, and AdWords to verify our findings.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07593</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Bias in training datasets must be managed for various groups in
classification tasks to ensure parity or equal treatment. With the recent
growth in artificial intelligence models and their expanding role in automated
decision-making, ensuring that these models are not biased is vital. There is
an abundance of evidence suggesting that these models could contain or even
amplify the bias present in the data on which they are trained, inherent to
their objective function and learning algorithms; Many researchers direct their
attention to this issue in different directions, namely, changing data to be
statistically independent, adversarial training for restricting the
capabilities of a particular competitor who aims to maximize parity, etc. These
methods result in information loss and do not provide a suitable balance
between accuracy and fairness or do not ensure limiting the biases in training.
To this end, we propose a powerful strategy for training deep learning models
called the Distraction module, which can be theoretically proven effective in
controlling bias from affecting the classification results. This method can be
utilized with different data types (e.g., Tabular, images, graphs, etc.). We
demonstrate the potency of the proposed method by testing it on UCI Adult and
Heritage Health datasets (tabular), POKEC-Z, POKEC-N and NBA datasets (graph),
and CelebA dataset (vision). Using state-of-the-art methods proposed in the
fairness literature for each dataset, we exhibit our model is superior to these
proposed methods in minimizing bias and maintaining accuracy.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;A quantum thermal machine is an open quantum system that enables the
conversion between heat and work at the micro or nano-scale. Optimally
controlling such out-of-equilibrium systems is a crucial yet challenging task
with applications to quantum technologies and devices. We introduce a general

out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic cycles that are Pareto optimal trade-offs
between power and efficiency for quantum heat engines and refrigerators. The
method does not require any knowledge of the quantum thermal machine, nor of
the system model, nor of the quantum state. Instead, it only observes the heat
fluxes, so it is both applicable to simulations and experimental devices. We
test our method on a model of an experimentally realistic refrigerator based on
a superconducting qubit, and on a heat engine based on a quantum harmonic
oscillator. In both cases, we identify the Pareto-front representing optimal
power-efficiency tradeoffs, and the corresponding cycles. Such solutions
outperform previous proposals made in the literature, such as optimized Otto
cycles, reducing quantum friction.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10806</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Hybrid human-ML systems increasingly make consequential decisions in a wide
range of domains. These systems are often introduced with the expectation that
the combined human-ML system will achieve complementary performance, that is,
the combined decision-making system will be an improvement compared with either
decision-making agent in isolation. However, empirical results have been mixed,
and existing research rarely articulates the sources and mechanisms by which
complementary performance is expected to arise. Our goal in this work is to
provide conceptual tools to advance the way researchers reason and communicate
about human-ML complementarity. Drawing upon prior literature in human
psychology, machine learning, and human-computer interaction, we propose a
taxonomy characterizing distinct ways in which human and ML-based
decision-making can differ. In doing so, we conceptually map potential
mechanisms by which combining human and ML decision-making may yield
complementary performance, developing a language for the research community to
reason about design of hybrid systems in any decision-making domain. To
illustrate how our taxonomy can be used to investigate complementarity, we
provide a mathematical aggregation framework to examine enabling conditions for
complementarity. Through synthetic simulations, we demonstrate how this
framework can be used to explore specific aspects of our taxonomy and shed
light on the optimal mechanisms for combining human-ML judgments

<title>Gacs-Korner Common Information Variational Autoencoder. (arXiv:2205.12239v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We propose a notion of common information that allows one to quantify and
separate the information that is shared between two random variables from the
information that is unique to each. Our notion of common information is defined
by an optimization problem over a family of functions and recovers the
G\&apos;acs-K\&quot;orner common information as a special case. Importantly, our notion
can be approximated empirically using samples from the underlying data
distribution. We then provide a method to partition and quantify the common and
unique information using a simple modification of a traditional variational
auto-encoder. Empirically, we demonstrate that our formulation allows us to
learn semantically meaningful common and unique factors of variation even on
high-dimensional data such as images and videos. Moreover, on datasets where
ground-truth latent factors are known, we show that we can accurately quantify
the common information between the random variables.

<title>Detecting hidden confounding in observational data using multiple environments. (arXiv:2205.13935v4 [stat.ME] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13935</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;A common assumption in causal inference from observational data is that there
is no hidden confounding. Yet it is, in general, impossible to verify this
assumption from a single dataset. Under the assumption of independent causal
mechanisms underlying the data-generating process, we demonstrate a way to
detect unobserved confounders when having multiple observational datasets
coming from different environments. We present a theory for testable
conditional independencies that are only absent when there is hidden
confounding and examine cases where we violate its assumptions: degenerate &amp;amp;
dependent mechanisms, and faithfulness violations. Additionally, we propose a
procedure to test these independencies and study its empirical finite-sample
behavior using simulation studies and semi-synthetic data based on a real-world
dataset. In most cases, the proposed procedure correctly predicts the presence
of hidden confounding, particularly when the confounding bias is large.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Knowledge distillation aims to transfer useful information from a teacher
network to a student network, with the primary goal of improving the student&apos;s
performance for the task at hand. Over the years, there has a been a deluge of
novel techniques and use cases of knowledge distillation. Yet, despite the
various improvements, there seems to be a glaring gap in the community&apos;s
fundamental understanding of the process. Specifically, what is the knowledge
that gets distilled in knowledge distillation? In other words, in what ways
does the student become similar to the teacher? Does it start to localize
objects in the same way? Does it get fooled by the same adversarial samples?
Does its data invariance properties become similar? Our work presents a
comprehensive study to try to answer these questions. We show that existing
methods can indeed indirectly distill these properties beyond improving task
performance. We further study why knowledge distillation might work this way,

<title>A Robust Backpropagation-Free Framework for Images. (arXiv:2206.01820v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01820</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;While current deep learning algorithms have been successful for a wide
variety of artificial intelligence (AI) tasks, including those involving
structured image data, they present deep neurophysiological conceptual issues
due to their reliance on the gradients that are computed by backpropagation of
errors (backprop). Gradients are required to obtain synaptic weight adjustments
but require knowledge of feed-forward activities in order to conduct backward
propagation, a biologically implausible process. This is known as the &quot;weight
transport problem&quot;. Therefore, in this work, we present a more biologically
plausible approach towards solving the weight transport problem for image data.
This approach, which we name the error kernel driven activation alignment
(EKDAA) algorithm, accomplishes through the introduction of locally derived
error transmission kernels and error maps. Like standard deep learning
networks, EKDAA performs the standard forward process via weights and
activation functions; however, its backward error computation involves adaptive
error kernels that propagate local error signals through the network. The
efficacy of EKDAA is demonstrated by performing visual-recognition tasks on the
Fashion MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN benchmarks, along with demonstrating its
ability to extract visual features from natural color images. Furthermore, in
order to demonstrate its non-reliance on gradient computations, results are
presented for an EKDAA trained CNN that employs a non-differentiable activation
function.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The ever-growing concerns regarding data privacy have led to a paradigm shift
in machine learning (ML) architectures from centralized to distributed
approaches, giving rise to federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL) as
the two predominant privacy-preserving ML mechanisms. However,implementing FL
or SL in device-to-device (D2D)-enabled heterogeneous networks with diverse
clients presents substantial challenges, including architecture scalability and
prolonged training delays. To address these challenges, this article introduces
two innovative hybrid distributed ML architectures, namely, hybrid split FL
(HSFL) and hybrid federated SL (HFSL). Such architectures combine the strengths
of both FL and SL in D2D-enabled heterogeneous wireless networks. We provide a
comprehensive analysis of the performance and advantages of HSFL and HFSL,
while also highlighting open challenges for future exploration. We support our
proposals with preliminary simulations using three datasets in non-independent
and non-identically distributed settings, demonstrating the feasibility of our
architectures. Our simulations reveal notable reductions in
communication/computation costs and training delays as compared to conventional
FL and SL.

<title>Fast Kernel Methods for Generic Lipschitz Losses via $p$-Sparsified Sketches. (arXiv:2206.03827v7 [stat.ML] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03827</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Kernel methods are learning algorithms that enjoy solid theoretical
foundations while suffering from important computational limitations.
Sketching, which consists in looking for solutions among a subspace of reduced
dimension, is a well studied approach to alleviate these computational burdens.
However, statistically-accurate sketches, such as the Gaussian one, usually
contain few null entries, such that their application to kernel methods and
their non-sparse Gram matrices remains slow in practice. In this paper, we show
that sparsified Gaussian (and Rademacher) sketches still produce
theoretically-valid approximations while allowing for important time and space
savings thanks to an efficient \emph{decomposition trick}. To support our
method, we derive excess risk bounds for both single and multiple output kernel
problems, with generic Lipschitz losses, hereby providing new guarantees for a
wide range of applications, from robust regression to multiple quantile
regression. Our theoretical results are complemented with experiments showing
the empirical superiority of our approach over SOTA sketching methods.

<title>Gray Learning from Non-IID Data with Out-of-distribution Samples. (arXiv:2206.09375v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09375</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The integrity of training data, even when annotated by experts, is far from
guaranteed, especially for non-IID datasets comprising both in- and
out-of-distribution samples. In an ideal scenario, the majority of samples
would be in-distribution, while samples that deviate semantically would be
identified as out-of-distribution and excluded during the annotation process.
However, experts may erroneously classify these out-of-distribution samples as
in-distribution, assigning them labels that are inherently unreliable. This
mixture of unreliable labels and varied data types makes the task of learning
robust neural networks notably challenging. We observe that both in- and
out-of-distribution samples can almost invariably be ruled out from belonging
to certain classes, aside from those corresponding to unreliable ground-truth
labels. This opens the possibility of utilizing reliable complementary labels
that indicate the classes to which a sample does not belong. Guided by this
insight, we introduce a novel approach, termed \textit{Gray Learning} (GL),
which leverages both ground-truth and complementary labels. Crucially, GL
adaptively adjusts the loss weights for these two label types based on
prediction confidence levels. By grounding our approach in statistical learning
theory, we derive bounds for the generalization error, demonstrating that GL
achieves tight constraints even in non-IID settings. Extensive experimental
evaluations reveal that our method significantly outperforms alternative
approaches grounded in robust statistics.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04197</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Exploiting label correlations is important to multi-label classification.
Previous methods capture the high-order label correlations mainly by
transforming the label matrix to a latent label space with low-rank matrix
factorization. However, the label matrix is generally a full-rank or
approximate full-rank matrix, making the low-rank factorization inappropriate.
Besides, in the latent space, the label correlations will become implicit. To
this end, we propose a simple yet effective method to depict the high-order
label correlations explicitly, and at the same time maintain the high-rank of
the label matrix. Moreover, we estimate the label correlations and infer model
parameters simultaneously via the local geometric structure of the input to
achieve mutual enhancement. Comparative studies over twelve benchmark data sets
validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in multi-label
classification. The exploited high-order label correlations are consistent with
common sense empirically. Our code is publicly available at

<title>Monte Carlo is a good sampling strategy for polynomial approximation in high dimensions. (arXiv:2208.09045v3 [math.NA] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09045</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This paper concerns the approximation of smooth, high-dimensional functions
from limited samples using polynomials. This task lies at the heart of many
applications in computational science and engineering - notably, some of those
arising from parametric modelling and computational uncertainty quantification.
It is common to use Monte Carlo sampling in such applications, so as not to
succumb to the curse of dimensionality. However, it is well known that such a
strategy is theoretically suboptimal. Specifically, there are many polynomial
spaces of dimension $n$ for which the sample complexity scales
log-quadratically, i.e., like $c \cdot n^2 \cdot \log(n)$ as $n \rightarrow
\infty$. This well-documented phenomenon has led to a concerted effort over the
last decade to design improved, and moreover, near-optimal strategies, whose
sample complexities scale log-linearly, or even linearly in $n$. In this work
we demonstrate that Monte Carlo is actually a perfectly good strategy in high
dimensions, despite its apparent suboptimality. We first document this
phenomenon empirically via a systematic set of numerical experiments. Next, we
present a theoretical analysis that rigorously justifies this fact in the case
of holomorphic functions of infinitely-many variables. We show that there is a
least-squares approximation based on $m$ Monte Carlo samples whose error decays
algebraically fast in $m/\log(m)$, with a rate that is the same as that of the
best $n$-term polynomial approximation. This result is non-constructive, since
it assumes knowledge of a suitable polynomial subspace in which to perform the
approximation. We next present a compressed sensing-based scheme that achieves
the same rate, except for a larger polylogarithmic factor. This scheme is
practical, and numerically it performs as well as or better than well-known
adaptive least-squares schemes.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used for clustering with
strong interpretability. Among general NMF problems, symmetric NMF is a special
one that plays an important role in graph clustering where each element
measures the similarity between data points. Most existing symmetric NMF
algorithms require factor matrices to be nonnegative, and only focus on
minimizing the gap between similarity matrix and its approximation for
clustering, without giving a consideration to other potential regularization
terms which can yield better clustering. In this paper, we explore factorizing
a symmetric matrix that does not have to be nonnegative, presenting an
efficient factorization algorithm with a regularization term to boost the
clustering performance. Moreover, a more general framework is proposed to solve
symmetric matrix factorization problems with different constraints on the
factor matrices.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Continual learning and few-shot learning are important frontiers in progress
towards broader Machine Learning (ML) capabilities. There is a growing body of
work in both, but few works combining the two. One exception is the Continual
few-shot Learning (CFSL) framework of Antoniou et al. &lt;a href=&quot;/abs/2004.11967&quot;&gt;arXiv:2004.11967&lt;/a&gt;. In this
study, we extend CFSL in two ways that capture a broader range of challenges,
important for intelligent agent behaviour in real-world conditions. First, we
modify CFSL to make it more comparable to standard continual learning
experiments, where usually a much larger number of classes are presented.
Second, we introduce an &apos;instance test&apos; which requires recognition of specific
instances of classes -- a capability of animal cognition that is usually
neglected in ML. For an initial exploration of ML model performance under these
conditions, we selected representative baseline models from the original CFSL
work and added a model variant with replay. As expected, learning more classes
is more difficult than the original CFSL experiments, and interestingly, the
way in which image instances and classes are presented affects classification
performance. Surprisingly, accuracy in the baseline instance test is comparable
to other classification tasks, but poor given significant occlusion and noise.
The use of replay for consolidation improves performance substantially for both
types of tasks, but particularly the instance test.

<title>Mutual Information Regularized Offline Reinforcement Learning. (arXiv:2210.07484v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07484</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The major challenge of offline RL is the distribution shift that appears when
out-of-distribution actions are queried, which makes the policy improvement
direction biased by extrapolation errors. Most existing methods address this
problem by penalizing the policy or value for deviating from the behavior
policy during policy improvement or evaluation. In this work, we propose a
novel MISA framework to approach offline RL from the perspective of Mutual
Information between States and Actions in the dataset by directly constraining
the policy improvement direction. MISA constructs lower bounds of mutual
information parameterized by the policy and Q-values. We show that optimizing
this lower bound is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood of a one-step
improved policy on the offline dataset. Hence, we constrain the policy
improvement direction to lie in the data manifold. The resulting algorithm
simultaneously augments the policy evaluation and improvement by adding mutual
information regularizations. MISA is a general framework that unifies
conservative Q-learning (CQL) and behavior regularization methods (e.g.,
TD3+BC) as special cases. We introduce 3 different variants of MISA, and
empirically demonstrate that tighter mutual information lower bound gives
better offline RL performance. In addition, our extensive experiments show MISA
significantly outperforms a wide range of baselines on various tasks of the
D4RL benchmark,e.g., achieving 742.9 total points on gym-locomotion tasks. Our
code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/MISA.

and decision-making systems, for instance in geospatial modeling, Bayesian
optimization, or in latent Gaussian models. Within a system, the Gaussian
process model needs to perform in a stable and reliable manner to ensure it
interacts correctly with other parts of the system. In this work, we study the
numerical stability of scalable sparse approximations based on inducing points.
To do so, we first review numerical stability, and illustrate typical
situations in which Gaussian process models can be unstable. Building on
stability theory originally developed in the interpolation literature, we
derive sufficient and in certain cases necessary conditions on the inducing
points for the computations performed to be numerically stable. For
low-dimensional tasks such as geospatial modeling, we propose an automated
method for computing inducing points satisfying these conditions. This is done
via a modification of the cover tree data structure, which is of independent
interest. We additionally propose an alternative sparse approximation for
regression with a Gaussian likelihood which trades off a small amount of
performance to further improve stability. We provide illustrative examples
showing the relationship between stability of calculations and predictive
performance of inducing point methods on spatial tasks.

<title>Multi-scale data reconstruction of turbulent rotating flows with Gappy POD, Extended POD and Generative Adversarial Networks. (arXiv:2210.11921v2 [physics.flu-dyn] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11921</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Data reconstruction of rotating turbulent snapshots is investigated utilizing
data-driven tools. This problem is crucial for numerous geophysical
applications and fundamental aspects, given the concurrent effects of direct
and inverse energy cascades, which lead to non-Gaussian statistics at both
large and small scales. Data assimilation also serves as a tool to rank
physical features within turbulence, by evaluating the performance of
reconstruction in terms of the quality and quantity of the information used.
Additionally, benchmarking various reconstruction techniques is essential to
assess the trade-off between quantitative supremacy, implementation complexity,
and explicability. In this study, we use linear and non-linear tools based on
the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) for reconstructing rotating turbulence snapshots with spatial damages
(inpainting). We focus on accurately reproducing both statistical properties
and instantaneous velocity fields. Different gap sizes and gap geometries are
investigated in order to assess the importance of coherency and multi-scale
properties of the missing information. Surprisingly enough, concerning
point-wise reconstruction, the non-linear GAN does not outperform one of the
linear POD techniques. On the other hand, supremacy of the GAN approach is
shown when the statistical multi-scale properties are compared. Similarly,
extreme events in the gap region are better predicted when using GAN. The
balance between point-wise error and statistical properties is controlled by
the adversarial ratio, which determines the relative importance of the
generator and the discriminator in the GAN training. Robustness against the
measurement noise is also discussed.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, significant advancements have been made in the field
of machine learning (ML) to address resource management, interference
management, autonomy, and decision-making in wireless networks. Traditional ML
approaches rely on centralized methods, where data is collected at a central
server for training. However, this approach poses a challenge in terms of
preserving the data privacy of devices. To address this issue, federated
learning (FL) has emerged as an effective solution that allows edge devices to
collaboratively train ML models without compromising data privacy. In FL, local
datasets are not shared, and the focus is on learning a global model for a
specific task involving all devices. However, FL has limitations when it comes
to adapting the model to devices with different data distributions. In such
cases, meta learning is considered, as it enables the adaptation of learning
models to different data distributions using only a few data samples. In this
tutorial, we present a comprehensive review of FL, meta learning, and federated
meta learning (FedMeta). Unlike other tutorial papers, our objective is to
explore how FL, meta learning, and FedMeta methodologies can be designed,
optimized, and evolved, and their applications over wireless networks. We also
analyze the relationships among these learning algorithms and examine their
advantages and disadvantages in real-world applications.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;A significant challenge facing researchers in the area of multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) pertains to the identification of a library that
can offer fast and compatible development for multi-agent tasks and algorithm
combinations, while obviating the need to consider compatibility issues. In
this paper, we present MARLlib, a library designed to address the
aforementioned challenge by leveraging three key mechanisms: 1) a standardized
multi-agent environment wrapper, 2) an agent-level algorithm implementation,
and 3) a flexible policy mapping strategy. By utilizing these mechanisms,
MARLlib can effectively disentangle the intertwined nature of the multi-agent
task and the learning process of the algorithm, with the ability to
automatically alter the training strategy based on the current task&apos;s

additionally making use of graph structure based on the relational inductive
bias (edge bias), rather than treating the nodes as collections of independent

have little performance gain or even underperform graph-agnostic NNs. To
identify these cases, based on graph signal processing and statistical
hypothesis testing, we propose two measures which analyze the cases in which
the edge bias in features and labels does not provide advantages. Based on the

<title>Using multimodal learning and deep generative models for corporate bankruptcy prediction. (arXiv:2211.08405v4 [q-fin.RM] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08405</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Textual data from financial filings, e.g., the Management&apos;s Discussion \&amp;amp;
Analysis (MDA) section in Form 10-K, has been used to improve the prediction
accuracy of bankruptcy models. In practice, however, we cannot obtain the MDA
section for all public companies. The two main reasons for the lack of MDA are:
(i) not all companies are obliged to submit the MDA and (ii) technical problems
arise when crawling and scrapping the MDA section. This research introduces for
the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the concept of multimodal
learning in bankruptcy prediction models to solve the problem that for some
companies we are unable to obtain the MDA text. We use the Conditional
Multimodal Discriminative (CMMD) model to learn multimodal representations that
embed information from accounting, market, and textual modalities. The CMMD
model needs a sample with all data modalities for model training. At test time,
the CMMD model only needs access to accounting and market modalities to
generate multimodal representations, which are further used to make bankruptcy
predictions. This fact makes the use of bankruptcy prediction models using
textual data realistic and possible, since accounting and market data are
available for all companies unlike textual data. The empirical results in this
research show that the classification performance of our proposed methodology
is superior compared to that of a large number of traditional classifier
models. We also show that our proposed methodology solves the limitation of
previous bankruptcy models using textual data, as they can only make
predictions for a small proportion of companies.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Neural networks are capable of translating between languages -- in some cases
even between two languages where there is little or no access to parallel
translations, in what is known as Unsupervised Machine Translation (UMT). Given
this progress, it is intriguing to ask whether machine learning tools can
ultimately enable understanding animal communication, particularly that of
highly intelligent animals. We propose a theoretical framework for analyzing
UMT when no parallel translations are available and when it cannot be assumed
that the source and target corpora address related subject domains or posses
similar linguistic structure. We exemplify this theory with two stylized models
of language, for which our framework provides bounds on necessary sample
complexity; the bounds are formally proven and experimentally verified on
synthetic data. These bounds show that the error rates are inversely related to
the language complexity and amount of common ground. This suggests that
unsupervised translation of animal communication may be feasible if the
communication system is sufficiently complex.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Although substantial efforts have been made using graph neural networks
(GNNs) for AI-driven drug discovery (AIDD), effective molecular representation
learning remains an open challenge, especially in the case of insufficient
labeled molecules. Recent studies suggest that big GNN models pre-trained by
self-supervised learning on unlabeled datasets enable better transfer
performance in downstream molecular property prediction tasks. However, the
approaches in these studies require multiple complex self-supervised tasks and
large-scale datasets, which are time-consuming, computationally expensive, and
difficult to pre-train end-to-end. Here, we design a simple yet effective
self-supervised strategy to simultaneously learn local and global information
about molecules, and further propose a novel bi-branch masked graph transformer
autoencoder (BatmanNet) to learn molecular representations. BatmanNet features
two tailored complementary and asymmetric graph autoencoders to reconstruct the
missing nodes and edges, respectively, from a masked molecular graph. With this
design, BatmanNet can effectively capture the underlying structure and semantic
information of molecules, thus improving the performance of molecular
representation. BatmanNet achieves state-of-the-art results for multiple drug
discovery tasks, including molecular properties prediction, drug-drug
interaction, and drug-target interaction, on 13 benchmark datasets,
demonstrating its great potential and superiority in molecular representation
learning.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Transfer learning has become an essential technique to exploit information
from the source domain to boost performance of the target task. Despite the
prevalence in high-dimensional data, heterogeneity and heavy tails are
insufficiently accounted for by current transfer learning approaches and thus
may undermine the resulting performance. We propose a transfer learning
procedure in the framework of high-dimensional quantile regression models to
accommodate heterogeneity and heavy tails in the source and target domains. We
establish error bounds of transfer learning estimator based on delicately
selected transferable source domains, showing that lower error bounds can be
achieved for critical selection criterion and larger sample size of source
tasks. We further propose valid confidence interval and hypothesis test
procedures for individual component of high-dimensional quantile regression
coefficients by advocating a double transfer learning estimator, which is
one-step debiased estimator for the transfer learning estimator wherein the
technique of transfer learning is designed again. By adopting data-splitting
technique, we advocate a transferability detection approach that guarantees to
circumvent negative transfer and identify transferable sources with high
probability. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits
some favorable and compelling performances and the practical utility is further
illustrated by analyzing a real example.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Contrails, short for condensation trails, are line-shaped ice clouds produced
by aircraft engine exhaust when they fly through cold and humid air. They
generate a greenhouse effect by absorbing or directing back to Earth
approximately 33% of emitted outgoing longwave radiation. They account for over
half of the climate change resulting from aviation activities. Avoiding
contrails and adjusting flight routes could be an inexpensive and effective way
to reduce their impact. An accurate, automated, and reliable detection
algorithm is required to develop and evaluate contrail avoidance strategies.
Advancement in contrail detection has been severely limited due to several
factors, primarily due to a lack of quality-labeled data. Recently, proposed a
large human-labeled Landsat-8 contrails dataset. Each contrail is carefully
labeled with various inputs in various scenes of Landsat-8 satellite imagery.
In this work, we benchmark several popular segmentation models with

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We study reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation. For
episodic time-inhomogeneous linear Markov decision processes (linear MDPs)
whose transition probability can be parameterized as a linear function of a
given feature mapping, we propose the first computationally efficient algorithm
that achieves the nearly minimax optimal regret $\tilde O(d\sqrt{H^3K})$, where
$d$ is the dimension of the feature mapping, $H$ is the planning horizon, and
$K$ is the number of episodes. Our algorithm is based on a weighted linear
regression scheme with a carefully designed weight, which depends on a new
variance estimator that (1) directly estimates the variance of the optimal
value function, (2) monotonically decreases with respect to the number of
episodes to ensure a better estimation accuracy, and (3) uses a rare-switching
policy to update the value function estimator to control the complexity of the
estimated value function class. Our work provides a complete answer to optimal

convexity assumption. We address this issue by developing novel techniques to
progressively estimate the strong convexity of the Lagrangian function. Our
approach yields an improved complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$,
matching the complexity lower bound for strongly-convex-concave saddle point
optimization. We show the superior performance of our methods in
sparsity-inducing constrained optimization, notably Google&apos;s personalized
PageRank problem. Furthermore, we show that a restarted version of the proposed
methods can effectively identify the sparsity pattern of the optimal solution
within a finite number of steps, a result that appears to have independent
significance.

<title>Robust Meta-Representation Learning via Global Label Inference and Classification. (arXiv:2212.11702v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11702</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Few-shot learning (FSL) is a central problem in meta-learning, where learners
must efficiently learn from few labeled examples. Within FSL, feature
pre-training has recently become an increasingly popular strategy to
significantly improve generalization performance. However, the contribution of
pre-training is often overlooked and understudied, with limited theoretical
understanding of its impact on meta-learning performance. Further, pre-training
requires a consistent set of global labels shared across training tasks, which
may be unavailable in practice. In this work, we address the above issues by
first showing the connection between pre-training and meta-learning. We discuss
why pre-training yields more robust meta-representation and connect the
theoretical analysis to existing works and empirical results. Secondly, we
introduce Meta Label Learning (MeLa), a novel meta-learning algorithm that
learns task relations by inferring global labels across tasks. This allows us
to exploit pre-training for FSL even when global labels are unavailable or
ill-defined. Lastly, we introduce an augmented pre-training procedure that
further improves the learned meta-representation. Empirically, MeLa outperforms
existing methods across a diverse range of benchmarks, in particular under a
more challenging setting where the number of training tasks is limited and
labels are task-specific. We also provide extensive ablation study to highlight
its key properties.

<title>Robust representations of oil wells&apos; intervals via sparse attention mechanism. (arXiv:2212.14246v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14246</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Transformer-based neural network architectures achieve state-of-the-art
results in different domains, from natural language processing (NLP) to
computer vision (CV). The key idea of Transformers, the attention mechanism,
has already led to significant breakthroughs in many areas. The attention has
found their implementation for time series data as well. However, due to the
quadratic complexity of the attention calculation regarding input sequence
length, the application of Transformers is limited by high resource demands.
Moreover, their modifications for industrial time series need to be robust to
missing or noised values, which complicates the expansion of the horizon of
their application. To cope with these issues, we introduce the class of
efficient Transformers named Regularized Transformers (Reguformers). We
implement the regularization technique inspired by the dropout ideas to improve
robustness and reduce computational expenses. The focus in our experiments is
on oil&amp;amp;gas data, namely, well logs, a prominent example of multivariate time
series. The goal is to solve the problems of similarity and representation
learning for them. To evaluate our models for such problems, we work with an
industry-scale open dataset consisting of well logs of more than 20 wells. The
experiments show that all variations of Reguformers outperform the previously
developed RNNs, classical Transformer model, and robust modifications of it
like Informer and Performer in terms of well-intervals&apos; classification and the
quality of the obtained well-intervals&apos; representations. Moreover, the
sustainability to missing and incorrect data in our models exceeds that of
others by a significant margin. The best result that the Reguformer achieves on
well-interval similarity task is the mean PR~AUC score equal to 0.983, which is
comparable to the classical Transformer and outperforms the previous models.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Inference problems for two-dimensional snapshots of rotating turbulent flows
are studied. We perform a systematic quantitative benchmark of point-wise and
statistical reconstruction capabilities of the linear Extended Proper
Orthogonal Decomposition (EPOD) method, a non-linear Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We attack the
important task of inferring one velocity component out of the measurement of a
second one, and two cases are studied: (I) both components lay in the plane
orthogonal to the rotation axis and (II) one of the two is parallel to the
rotation axis. We show that EPOD method works well only for the former case
where both components are strongly correlated, while CNN and GAN always
outperform EPOD both concerning point-wise and statistical reconstructions. For
case (II), when the input and output data are weakly correlated, all methods
fail to reconstruct faithfully the point-wise information. In this case, only
GAN is able to reconstruct the field in a statistical sense. The analysis is
performed using both standard validation tools based on $L_2$ spatial distance
between the prediction and the ground truth and more sophisticated multi-scale
analysis using wavelet decomposition. Statistical validation is based on
standard Jensen-Shannon divergence between the probability density functions,
spectral properties and multi-scale flatness.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08110</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large
numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities.
Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most
crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they
rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the
forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in
production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative
transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a
modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms
of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the
output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a
parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity
neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and
image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current
state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being
computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model
inference deployments.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11841</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Physics-based simulation of mesh based domains remains a challenging task.
State-of-the-art techniques can produce realistic results but require expert
knowledge. A major bottleneck in many approaches is the step of integrating a
potential energy in order to compute velocities or displacements. Recently,
learning based method for physics-based simulation have sparked interest with
graph based approaches being a promising research direction. One of the
challenges for these methods is to generate models that are mesh independent
and generalize to different material properties. Moreover, the model should
also be able to react to unforeseen external forces like ubiquitous collisions.
Our contribution is based on a simple observation: evaluating forces is
computationally relatively cheap for traditional simulation methods and can be
computed in parallel in contrast to their integration. If we learn how a system
reacts to forces in general, irrespective of their origin, we can learn an
integrator that can predict state changes due to the total forces with high
generalization power. We effectively factor out the physical model behind
resulting forces by relying on an opaque force module. We demonstrate that this
idea leads to a learnable module that can be trained on basic internal forces
of small mesh patches and generalizes to different mesh typologies,
resolutions, material parameters and unseen forces like collisions at inference
time. Our proposed paradigm is general and can be used to model a variety of
physical phenomena. We focus our exposition on the detail enhancement of coarse
clothing geometry which has many applications including computer games, virtual
reality and virtual try-on.

<title>A Novel Framework for Policy Mirror Descent with General Parameterization and Linear Convergence. (arXiv:2301.13139v3 [stat.ML] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13139</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Modern policy optimization methods in reinforcement learning, such as TRPO
and PPO, owe their success to the use of parameterized policies. However, while
theoretical guarantees have been established for this class of algorithms,
especially in the tabular setting, the use of general parameterization schemes
remains mostly unjustified. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for
policy optimization based on mirror descent that naturally accommodates general
parameterizations. The policy class induced by our scheme recovers known
classes, e.g., softmax, and generates new ones depending on the choice of
mirror map. Using our framework, we obtain the first result that guarantees
linear convergence for a policy-gradient-based method involving general
parameterization. To demonstrate the ability of our framework to accommodate
general parameterization schemes, we provide its sample complexity when using
shallow neural networks, show that it represents an improvement upon the
previous best results, and empirically validate the effectiveness of our
theoretical claims on classic control tasks.

<title>The Power of Preconditioning in Overparameterized Low-Rank Matrix Sensing. (arXiv:2302.01186v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01186</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We propose $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$, a preconditioned gradient descent
method to tackle the low-rank matrix sensing problem when the true rank is
unknown, and when the matrix is possibly ill-conditioned. Using
overparametrized factor representations, $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$ starts
from a small random initialization, and proceeds by gradient descent with a
specific form of damped preconditioning to combat bad curvatures induced by
overparameterization and ill-conditioning. At the expense of light
computational overhead incurred by preconditioners,
$\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$ is remarkably robust to ill-conditioning
compared to vanilla gradient descent ($\textsf{GD}$) even with
overprameterization. Specifically, we show that, under the Gaussian design,
$\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$ converges to the true low-rank matrix at a
constant linear rate after a small number of iterations that scales only
logarithmically with respect to the condition number and the problem dimension.
This significantly improves over the convergence rate of vanilla $\textsf{GD}$
which suffers from a polynomial dependency on the condition number. Our work
provides evidence on the power of preconditioning in accelerating the
convergence without hurting generalization in overparameterized learning.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide a probabilistic interpretation for
deep learning models by imposing a prior distribution over model parameters and
inferring a posterior distribution based on observed data. The model sampled
from the posterior distribution can be used for providing ensemble predictions
and quantifying prediction uncertainty. It is well-known that deep learning
models with lower sharpness have better generalization ability. However,
existing posterior inferences are not aware of sharpness/flatness in terms of
formulation, possibly leading to high sharpness for the models sampled from
them. In this paper, we develop theories, the Bayesian setting, and the
variational inference approach for the sharpness-aware posterior. Specifically,
the models sampled from our sharpness-aware posterior, and the optimal
approximate posterior estimating this sharpness-aware posterior, have better
flatness, hence possibly possessing higher generalization ability. We conduct
experiments by leveraging the sharpness-aware posterior with state-of-the-art
Bayesian Neural Networks, showing that the flat-seeking counterparts outperform
their baselines in all metrics of interest.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Melanoma diagnosed and treated in its early stages can increase the survival
rate. A projected increase in skin cancer incidents and a dearth of
dermatopathologists have emphasized the need for computational pathology
(CPATH) systems. CPATH systems with deep learning (DL) models have the
potential to identify the presence of melanoma by exploiting underlying
morphological and cellular features. This paper proposes a DL method to detect
melanoma and distinguish between normal skin and benign/malignant melanocytic
lesions in Whole Slide Images (WSI). Our method detects lesions with high
accuracy and localizes them on a WSI to identify potential regions of interest
for pathologists. Interestingly, our DL method relies on using a single CNN
network to create localization maps first and use them to perform slide-level
predictions to determine patients who have melanoma. Our best model provides
favorable patch-wise classification results with a 0.992 F1 score and 0.99

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We present a unified framework for deriving PAC-Bayesian generalization
bounds. Unlike most previous literature on this topic, our bounds are
anytime-valid (i.e., time-uniform), meaning that they hold at all stopping
times, not only for a fixed sample size. Our approach combines four tools in
the following order: (a) nonnegative supermartingales or reverse
submartingales, (b) the method of mixtures, (c) the Donsker-Varadhan formula
(or other convex duality principles), and (d) Ville&apos;s inequality. Our main
result is a PAC-Bayes theorem which holds for a wide class of discrete
stochastic processes. We show how this result implies time-uniform versions of
well-known classical PAC-Bayes bounds, such as those of Seeger, McAllester,
Maurer, and Catoni, in addition to many recent bounds. We also present several
novel bounds. Our framework also enables us to relax traditional assumptions;
in particular, we consider nonstationary loss functions and non-i.i.d. data. In
sum, we unify the derivation of past bounds and ease the search for future
bounds: one may simply check if our supermartingale or submartingale conditions
are met and, if so, be guaranteed a (time-uniform) PAC-Bayes bound.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Data pruning algorithms are commonly used to reduce the memory and
computational cost of the optimization process. Recent empirical results reveal
that random data pruning remains a strong baseline and outperforms most
existing data pruning methods in the high compression regime, i.e., where a
fraction of $30\%$ or less of the data is kept. This regime has recently
attracted a lot of interest as a result of the role of data pruning in
improving the so-called neural scaling laws; in [Sorscher et al.], the authors
showed the need for high-quality data pruning algorithms in order to beat the
sample power law.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we focus on score-based data pruning algorithms and show
theoretically and empirically why such algorithms fail in the high compression

<title>ClaPIM: Scalable Sequence CLAssification using Processing-In-Memory. (arXiv:2302.08284v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08284</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;DNA sequence classification is a fundamental task in computational biology
with vast implications for applications such as disease prevention and drug
design. Therefore, fast high-quality sequence classifiers are significantly
important. This paper introduces ClaPIM, a scalable DNA sequence classification
architecture based on the emerging concept of hybrid in-crossbar and
near-crossbar memristive processing-in-memory (PIM). We enable efficient and
high-quality classification by uniting the filter and search stages within a
single algorithm. Specifically, we propose a custom filtering technique that
drastically narrows the search space and a search approach that facilitates
approximate string matching through a distance function. ClaPIM is the first
PIM architecture for scalable approximate string matching that benefits from
the high density of memristive crossbar arrays and the massive computational
parallelism of PIM. Compared with Kraken2, a state-of-the-art software
classifier, ClaPIM provides significantly higher classification quality (up to
20x improvement in F1 score) and also demonstrates a 1.8x throughput
improvement. Compared with EDAM, a recently-proposed SRAM-based accelerator
that is restricted to small datasets, we observe both a 30.4x improvement in
normalized throughput per area and a 7% increase in classification precision.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10798</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The subject of green AI has been gaining attention within the deep learning
community given the recent trend of ever larger and more complex neural network
models. Existing solutions for reducing the computational load of training at
inference time usually involve pruning the network parameters. Pruning schemes
often create extra overhead either by iterative training and fine-tuning for
static pruning or repeated computation of a dynamic pruning graph. We propose a
new parameter pruning strategy for learning a lighter-weight sub-network that
minimizes the energy cost while maintaining comparable performance to the fully
parameterised network on given downstream tasks. Our proposed pruning scheme is
green-oriented, as it only requires a one-off training to discover the optimal
static sub-networks by dynamic pruning methods. The pruning scheme consists of
a binary gating module and a novel loss function to uncover sub-networks with
user-defined sparsity. Our method enables pruning and training simultaneously,
which saves energy in both the training and inference phases and avoids extra
computational overhead from gating modules at inference time. Our results on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 suggest that our scheme can remove 50% of connections in
deep networks with less than 1% reduction in classification accuracy. Compared
to other related pruning methods, our method demonstrates a lower drop in
accuracy for equivalent reductions in computational cost.

<title>Benign Overfitting for Two-layer ReLU Convolutional Neural Networks. (arXiv:2303.04145v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04145</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Modern deep learning models with great expressive power can be trained to
overfit the training data but still generalize well. This phenomenon is
referred to as \textit{benign overfitting}. Recently, a few studies have
attempted to theoretically understand benign overfitting in neural networks.
However, these works are either limited to neural networks with smooth
activation functions or to the neural tangent kernel regime. How and when
benign overfitting can occur in ReLU neural networks remains an open problem.
In this work, we seek to answer this question by establishing
algorithm-dependent risk bounds for learning two-layer ReLU convolutional
neural networks with label-flipping noise. We show that, under mild conditions,
the neural network trained by gradient descent can achieve near-zero training
loss and Bayes optimal test risk. Our result also reveals a sharp transition
between benign and harmful overfitting under different conditions on data
distribution in terms of test risk. Experiments on synthetic data back up our
theory.

<title>Multilevel Diffusion: Infinite Dimensional Score-Based Diffusion Models for Image Generation. (arXiv:2303.04772v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04772</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Score-based diffusion models (SBDM) have recently emerged as state-of-the-art
approaches for image generation. Existing SBDMs are typically formulated in a
finite-dimensional setting, where images are considered as tensors of finite
size. This paper develops SBDMs in the infinite-dimensional setting, that is,
we model the training data as functions supported on a rectangular domain.
Besides the quest for generating images at ever higher resolution, our primary
motivation is to create a well-posed infinite-dimensional learning problem so
that we can discretize it consistently on multiple resolution levels. We
thereby intend to obtain diffusion models that generalize across different
resolution levels and improve the efficiency of the training process. We
demonstrate how to overcome two shortcomings of current SBDM approaches in the
infinite-dimensional setting. First, we modify the forward process to ensure
that the latent distribution is well-defined in the infinite-dimensional
setting using the notion of trace class operators. We derive the reverse
processes for finite approximations. Second, we illustrate that approximating
the score function with an operator network is beneficial for multilevel
training. After deriving the convergence of the discretization and the
approximation of multilevel training, we implement an infinite-dimensional SBDM
approach and show the first promising results on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST,
underlining our developed theory.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05445</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Multi-armed bandits are extensively used to model sequential decision-making,
making them ubiquitous in many real-life applications such as online
recommender systems and wireless networking. We consider a multi-agent setting
where each agent solves their own bandit instance endowed with a different set
of arms. Their goal is to minimize their group regret while collaborating via
some communication protocol over a given network. Previous literature on this
problem only considered arm heterogeneity and networked agents separately. In
this work, we introduce a setting that encompasses both features. For this
novel setting, we first provide a rigorous regret analysis for a standard
flooding protocol combined with the classic UCB policy. Then, to mitigate the
issue of high communication costs incurred by flooding in complex networks, we
propose a new protocol called Flooding with Absorption (FwA). We provide a
theoretical analysis of the resulting regret bound and discuss the advantages
of using FwA over flooding. Lastly, we experimentally verify on various
scenarios, including dynamic networks, that FwA leads to significantly lower
communication costs despite minimal regret performance loss compared to other
network protocols.

<title>Stochastic Interpolants: A Unifying Framework for Flows and Diffusions. (arXiv:2303.08797v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08797</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;A class of generative models that unifies flow-based and diffusion-based
methods is introduced. These models extend the framework proposed in Albergo &amp;amp;
Vanden-Eijnden (2023), enabling the use of a broad class of continuous-time
stochastic processes called `stochastic interpolants&apos; to bridge any two
arbitrary probability density functions exactly in finite time. These
interpolants are built by combining data from the two prescribed densities with
an additional latent variable that shapes the bridge in a flexible way. The
time-dependent probability density function of the stochastic interpolant is
shown to satisfy a first-order transport equation as well as a family of
forward and backward Fokker-Planck equations with tunable diffusion
coefficient. Upon consideration of the time evolution of an individual sample,
this viewpoint immediately leads to both deterministic and stochastic
generative models based on probability flow equations or stochastic
differential equations with an adjustable level of noise. The drift
coefficients entering these models are time-dependent velocity fields
characterized as the unique minimizers of simple quadratic objective functions,
one of which is a new objective for the score of the interpolant density. We
show that minimization of these quadratic objectives leads to control of the
likelihood for generative models built upon stochastic dynamics, while
likelihood control for deterministic dynamics is more stringent. We also
discuss connections with other methods such as score-based diffusion models,
stochastic localization processes, probabilistic denoising techniques, and
rectifying flows. In addition, we demonstrate that stochastic interpolants
recover the Schr\&quot;odinger bridge between the two target densities when
explicitly optimizing over the interpolant. Finally, algorithmic aspects are
discussed and the approach is illustrated on numerical examples.

<title>Is BERT Blind? Exploring the Effect of Vision-and-Language Pretraining on Visual Language Understanding. (arXiv:2303.12513v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12513</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Most humans use visual imagination to understand and reason about language,
but models such as BERT reason about language using knowledge acquired during
text-only pretraining. In this work, we investigate whether vision-and-language
pretraining can improve performance on text-only tasks that involve implicit
visual reasoning, focusing primarily on zero-shot probing methods. We propose a
suite of visual language understanding (VLU) tasks for probing the visual
reasoning abilities of text encoder models, as well as various non-visual
natural language understanding (NLU) tasks for comparison. We also contribute a
novel zero-shot knowledge probing method, Stroop probing, for applying models
such as CLIP to text-only tasks without needing a prediction head such as the
masked language modelling head of models like BERT. We show that SOTA
multimodally trained text encoders outperform unimodally trained text encoders
on the VLU tasks while being underperformed by them on the NLU tasks, lending
new context to previously mixed results regarding the NLU capabilities of
multimodal models. We conclude that exposure to images during pretraining
affords inherent visual reasoning knowledge that is reflected in language-only
tasks that require implicit visual reasoning. Our findings bear importance in
the broader context of multimodal learning, providing principled guidelines for
the choice of text encoders used in such contexts.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14269</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In practice, encoding invariances into models improves sample complexity. In
this work, we study this phenomenon from a theoretical perspective. In
particular, we provide minimax optimal rates for kernel ridge regression on
compact manifolds, with a target function that is invariant to a group action
on the manifold. Our results hold for any smooth compact Lie group action, even
groups of positive dimension. For a finite group, the gain effectively
multiplies the number of samples by the group size. For groups of positive
dimension, the gain is observed by a reduction in the manifold&apos;s dimension, in
addition to a factor proportional to the volume of the quotient space. Our
proof takes the viewpoint of differential geometry, in contrast to the more
common strategy of using invariant polynomials. This new geometric viewpoint on
learning with invariances may be of independent interest.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Composed image retrieval searches for a target image based on a multi-modal
user query comprised of a reference image and modification text describing the
desired changes. Existing approaches to solving this challenging task learn a
mapping from the (reference image, modification text)-pair to an image
embedding that is then matched against a large image corpus. One area that has
not yet been explored is the reverse direction, which asks the question, what
reference image when modified as described by the text would produce the given
target image? In this work we propose a bi-directional training scheme that
leverages such reversed queries and can be applied to existing composed image
retrieval architectures with minimum changes, which improves the performance of
the model. To encode the bi-directional query we prepend a learnable token to
the modification text that designates the direction of the query and then
finetune the parameters of the text embedding module. We make no other changes
to the network architecture. Experiments on two standard datasets show that our
novel approach achieves improved performance over a baseline BLIP-based model

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aims to identify test examples that do
not belong to the training distribution and are thus unlikely to be predicted
reliably. Despite a plethora of existing works, most of them focused only on
the scenario where OOD examples come from semantic shift (e.g., unseen
categories), ignoring other possible causes (e.g., covariate shift). In this
paper, we present a novel, unifying framework to study OOD detection in a
broader scope. Instead of detecting OOD examples from a particular cause, we
propose to detect examples that a deployed machine learning model (e.g., an
image classifier) is unable to predict correctly. That is, whether a test
example should be detected and rejected or not is ``model-specific&apos;&apos;. We show
that this framework unifies the detection of OOD examples caused by semantic
shift and covariate shift, and closely addresses the concern of applying a
machine learning model to uncontrolled environments. We provide an extensive
analysis that involves a variety of models (e.g., different architectures and
training strategies), sources of OOD examples, and OOD detection approaches,
and reveal several insights into improving and understanding OOD detection in
uncontrolled environments.

<title>An adaptive safety layer with hard constraints for safe reinforcement learning in multi-energy management systems. (arXiv:2304.08897v3 [eess.SY] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08897</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Safe reinforcement learning (RL) with hard constraint guarantees is a
promising optimal control direction for multi-energy management systems. It
only requires the environment-specific constraint functions itself a priori and
not a complete model. The project-specific upfront and ongoing engineering
efforts are therefore still reduced, better representations of the underlying
system dynamics can still be learnt, and modelling bias is kept to a minimum.
However, even the constraint functions alone are not always trivial to
accurately provide in advance, leading to potentially unsafe behaviour. In this
paper, we present two novel advancements: (I) combining the OptLayer and
SafeFallback method, named OptLayerPolicy, to increase the initial utility
while keeping a high sample efficiency and the possibility to formulate
equality constraints. (II) introducing self-improving hard constraints, to
increase the accuracy of the constraint functions as more and new data becomes
available so that better policies can be learnt. Both advancements keep the
constraint formulation decoupled from the RL formulation, so new (presumably
better) RL algorithms can act as drop-in replacements. We have shown that, in a
simulated multi-energy system case study, the initial utility is increased to
92.4% (OptLayerPolicy) compared to 86.1% (OptLayer) and that the policy after
training is increased to 104.9% (GreyOptLayerPolicy) compared to 103.4%
(OptLayer) - all relative to a vanilla RL benchmark. Although introducing
surrogate functions into the optimisation problem requires special attention,
we conclude that the newly presented GreyOptLayerPolicy method is the most
advantageous.

<title>Bridging RL Theory and Practice with the Effective Horizon. (arXiv:2304.09853v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09853</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Deep reinforcement learning (RL) works impressively in some environments and
fails catastrophically in others. Ideally, RL theory should be able to provide
an understanding of why this is, i.e. bounds predictive of practical
performance. Unfortunately, current theory does not quite have this ability. We
compare standard deep RL algorithms to prior sample complexity bounds by
introducing a new dataset, BRIDGE. It consists of 155 deterministic MDPs from
common deep RL benchmarks, along with their corresponding tabular
representations, which enables us to exactly compute instance-dependent bounds.
We choose to focus on deterministic environments because they share many
interesting properties of stochastic environments, but are easier to analyze.
Using BRIDGE, we find that prior bounds do not correlate well with when deep RL
succeeds vs. fails, but discover a surprising property that does. When actions
with the highest Q-values under the random policy also have the highest
Q-values under the optimal policy (i.e. when it is optimal to be greedy on the
random policy&apos;s Q function), deep RL tends to succeed; when they don&apos;t, deep RL
tends to fail. We generalize this property into a new complexity measure of an
MDP that we call the effective horizon, which roughly corresponds to how many
steps of lookahead search would be needed in that MDP in order to identify the
next optimal action, when leaf nodes are evaluated with random rollouts. Using
BRIDGE, we show that the effective horizon-based bounds are more closely
reflective of the empirical performance of PPO and DQN than prior sample
complexity bounds across four metrics. We also find that, unlike existing
bounds, the effective horizon can predict the effects of using reward shaping
or a pre-trained exploration policy. Our code and data are available at

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Explaining the behaviour of intelligent agents learned by reinforcement
learning (RL) to humans is challenging yet crucial due to their
incomprehensible proprioceptive states, variational intermediate goals, and
resultant unpredictability. Moreover, one-step explanations for RL agents can
be ambiguous as they fail to account for the agent&apos;s future behaviour at each
transition, adding to the complexity of explaining robot actions. By leveraging
abstracted actions that map to task-specific primitives, we avoid explanations
on the movement level. To further improve the transparency and explainability
of robotic systems, we propose an explainable Q-Map learning framework that
combines reward decomposition (RD) with abstracted action spaces, allowing for

<title>Calibrated Explanations: with Uncertainty Information and Counterfactuals. (arXiv:2305.02305v3 [cs.AI] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02305</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;While local explanations for AI models can offer insights into individual
predictions, such as feature importance, they are plagued by issues like
instability. The unreliability of feature weights, often skewed due to poorly
calibrated ML models, deepens these challenges. Moreover, the critical aspect
of feature importance uncertainty remains mostly unaddressed in Explainable AI
(XAI). The novel feature importance explanation method presented in this paper,
called Calibrated Explanations (CE), is designed to tackle these issues
head-on. Built on the foundation of Venn-Abers, CE not only calibrates the
underlying model but also delivers reliable feature importance explanations
with an exact definition of the feature weights. CE goes beyond conventional
solutions by addressing output uncertainty. It accomplishes this by providing
uncertainty quantification for both feature weights and the model&apos;s probability
estimates. Additionally, CE is model-agnostic, featuring easily comprehensible
conditional rules and the ability to generate counterfactual explanations with
embedded uncertainty quantification. Results from an evaluation with 25
benchmark datasets underscore the efficacy of CE, making it stand as a fast,
reliable, stable, and robust solution.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We investigate the ability of transformer models to approximate the CKY
algorithm, using them to directly predict a sentence&apos;s parse and thus avoid the
CKY algorithm&apos;s cubic dependence on sentence length. We find that on standard
constituency parsing benchmarks this approach achieves competitive or better
performance than comparable parsers that make use of CKY, while being faster.
We also evaluate the viability of this approach for parsing under
\textit{random} PCFGs. Here we find that performance declines as the grammar
becomes more ambiguous, suggesting that the transformer is not fully capturing
the CKY computation. However, we also find that incorporating additional
inductive bias is helpful, and we propose a novel approach that makes use of
gradients with respect to chart representations in predicting the parse, in
analogy with the CKY algorithm being a subgradient of a partition function

<title>Improving Code Example Recommendations on Informal Documentation Using BERT and Query-Aware LSH: A Comparative Study. (arXiv:2305.03017v4 [cs.SE] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03017</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Our research investigates the recommendation of code examples to aid software
developers, a practice that saves developers significant time by providing
ready-to-use code snippets. The focus of our study is Stack Overflow, a
commonly used resource for coding discussions and solutions, particularly in
the context of the Java programming language. We applied BERT, a powerful Large
Language Model (LLM) that enables us to transform code examples into numerical
vectors by extracting their semantic information. Once these numerical
representations are prepared, we identify Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)
using Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH). Our research employed two variants of
LSH: Random Hyperplane-based LSH and Query-Aware LSH. We rigorously compared
these two approaches across four parameters: HitRate, Mean Reciprocal Rank
(MRR), Average Execution Time, and Relevance. Our study revealed that the
Query-Aware (QA) approach showed superior performance over the Random
Hyperplane-based (RH) method. Specifically, it exhibited a notable improvement
of 20\% to 35\% in HitRate for query pairs compared to the RH approach.
Furthermore, the QA approach proved significantly more time-efficient, with its
speed in creating hashing tables and assigning data samples to buckets being at
least four times faster. It can return code examples within milliseconds,
whereas the RH approach typically requires several seconds to recommend code
examples. Due to the superior performance of the QA approach, we tested it
against PostFinder and FaCoY, the state-of-the-art baselines. Our QA method
showed comparable efficiency proving its potential for effective code
recommendation.

<title>HACMan: Learning Hybrid Actor-Critic Maps for 6D Non-Prehensile Manipulation. (arXiv:2305.03942v4 [cs.RO] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03942</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Manipulating objects without grasping them is an essential component of human
dexterity, referred to as non-prehensile manipulation. Non-prehensile
manipulation may enable more complex interactions with the objects, but also
presents challenges in reasoning about gripper-object interactions. In this
work, we introduce Hybrid Actor-Critic Maps for Manipulation (HACMan), a
reinforcement learning approach for 6D non-prehensile manipulation of objects
using point cloud observations. HACMan proposes a temporally-abstracted and
spatially-grounded object-centric action representation that consists of
selecting a contact location from the object point cloud and a set of motion
parameters describing how the robot will move after making contact. We modify
an existing off-policy RL algorithm to learn in this hybrid discrete-continuous
action representation. We evaluate HACMan on a 6D object pose alignment task in
both simulation and in the real world. On the hardest version of our task, with
randomized initial poses, randomized 6D goals, and diverse object categories,
our policy demonstrates strong generalization to unseen object categories
without a performance drop, achieving an 89% success rate on unseen objects in
simulation and 50% success rate with zero-shot transfer in the real world.
Compared to alternative action representations, HACMan achieves a success rate
more than three times higher than the best baseline. With zero-shot sim2real
transfer, our policy can successfully manipulate unseen objects in the real
world for challenging non-planar goals, using dynamic and contact-rich
non-prehensile skills. Videos can be found on the project website:

<title>Recommender Systems with Generative Retrieval. (arXiv:2305.05065v3 [cs.IR] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05065</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Modern recommender systems perform large-scale retrieval by first embedding
queries and item candidates in the same unified space, followed by approximate
nearest neighbor search to select top candidates given a query embedding. In
this paper, we propose a novel generative retrieval approach, where the
retrieval model autoregressively decodes the identifiers of the target
candidates. To that end, we create semantically meaningful tuple of codewords
to serve as a Semantic ID for each item. Given Semantic IDs for items in a user
session, a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model is trained to predict
the Semantic ID of the next item that the user will interact with. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first Semantic ID-based generative model for
recommendation tasks. We show that recommender systems trained with the
proposed paradigm significantly outperform the current SOTA models on various
datasets. In addition, we show that incorporating Semantic IDs into the
sequence-to-sequence model enhances its ability to generalize, as evidenced by
the improved retrieval performance observed for items with no prior interaction
history.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05803</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) aims to bypass the need for
laborious pixel-level annotation by using only image-level annotation. Most
existing methods rely on Class Activation Maps (CAM) to derive pixel-level
pseudo-labels and use them to train a fully supervised semantic segmentation
model. Although these pseudo-labels are class-aware, indicating the coarse
regions for particular classes, they are not object-aware and fail to delineate
accurate object boundaries. To address this, we introduce a simple yet
effective method harnessing the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a class-agnostic
foundation model capable of producing fine-grained instance masks of objects,
parts, and subparts. We use CAM pseudo-labels as cues to select and combine SAM
masks, resulting in high-quality pseudo-labels that are both class-aware and
object-aware. Our approach is highly versatile and can be easily integrated
into existing WSSS methods without any modification. Despite its simplicity,
our approach shows consistent gain over the state-of-the-art WSSS methods on
both PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO datasets.

<title>RECKONING: Reasoning through Dynamic Knowledge Encoding. (arXiv:2305.06349v3 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06349</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Recent studies on transformer-based language models show that they can answer
questions by reasoning over knowledge provided as part of the context (i.e.,
in-context reasoning). However, since the available knowledge is often not
filtered for a particular question, in-context reasoning can be sensitive to
distractor facts, additional content that is irrelevant to a question but that
may be relevant for a different question (i.e., not necessarily random noise).
In these situations, the model fails to distinguish the knowledge that is
necessary to answer the question, leading to spurious reasoning and degraded
performance. This reasoning failure contrasts with the model&apos;s apparent ability
to distinguish its contextual knowledge from all the knowledge it has memorized
during pre-training. Following this observation, we propose teaching the model
to reason more robustly by folding the provided contextual knowledge into the
model&apos;s parameters before presenting it with a question. Our method, RECKONING,
is a bi-level learning algorithm that teaches language models to reason by
updating their parametric knowledge through back-propagation, allowing them to
then answer questions using the updated parameters. During training, the inner
loop rapidly adapts a copy of the model weights to encode contextual knowledge
into its parameters. In the outer loop, the model learns to use the updated
weights to reproduce and answer reasoning questions about the memorized
knowledge. Our experiments on two multi-hop reasoning datasets show that
RECKONING&apos;s performance improves over the in-context reasoning baseline (by up
to 4.5%). We also find that compared to in-context reasoning, RECKONING
generalizes better to longer reasoning chains unseen during training, is more
robust to distractors in the context, and is more computationally efficient
when multiple questions are asked about the same knowledge.

associated with introducing artifacts during the learning process. By invoking
such a NODE structure, which can also be viewed as a continuous variant of a
residual network (ResNet) and inherits its advantage in image denoising, our
model achieves enhanced accuracy and parameter efficiency. In particular, our
model exhibits consistent effectiveness in different scenarios, including
denoising gray and color images perturbed by Gaussian noise, as well as
real-noisy images, and demonstrates superiority in learning from small image
datasets.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12322</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Learning to predict properties of large graphs is challenging because each
prediction requires the knowledge of an entire graph, while the amount of
memory available during training is bounded. Here we propose Graph Segment
Training (GST), a general framework that utilizes a divide-and-conquer approach
to allow learning large graph property prediction with a constant memory
footprint. GST first divides a large graph into segments and then
backpropagates through only a few segments sampled per training iteration. We
refine the GST paradigm by introducing a historical embedding table to
efficiently obtain embeddings for segments not sampled for backpropagation. To
mitigate the staleness of historical embeddings, we design two novel
techniques. First, we finetune the prediction head to fix the input
distribution shift. Second, we introduce Stale Embedding Dropout to drop some
stale embeddings during training to reduce bias. We evaluate our complete
method GST-EFD (with all the techniques together) on two large graph property
prediction benchmarks: MalNet and TpuGraphs. Our experiments show that GST-EFD
is both memory-efficient and fast, while offering a slight boost on test
accuracy over a typical full graph training regime.

<title>DreamWaltz: Make a Scene with Complex 3D Animatable Avatars. (arXiv:2305.12529v3 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12529</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We present DreamWaltz, a novel framework for generating and animating complex
3D avatars given text guidance and parametric human body prior. While recent
methods have shown encouraging results for text-to-3D generation of common
objects, creating high-quality and animatable 3D avatars remains challenging.
To create high-quality 3D avatars, DreamWaltz proposes 3D-consistent
occlusion-aware Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to optimize implicit neural
representations with canonical poses. It provides view-aligned supervision via
3D-aware skeleton conditioning which enables complex avatar generation without
artifacts and multiple faces. For animation, our method learns an animatable 3D
avatar representation from abundant image priors of diffusion model conditioned
on various poses, which could animate complex non-rigged avatars given
arbitrary poses without retraining. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that
DreamWaltz is an effective and robust approach for creating 3D avatars that can
take on complex shapes and appearances as well as novel poses for animation.
The proposed framework further enables the creation of complex scenes with
diverse compositions, including avatar-avatar, avatar-object and avatar-scene
interactions. See https://dreamwaltz3d.github.io/ for more vivid 3D avatar and
animation results.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Reproducing kernel Hilbert $C^*$-module (RKHM) is a generalization of
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) by means of $C^*$-algebra, and the
Perron-Frobenius operator is a linear operator related to the composition of

framework for kernel methods. We derive a new Rademacher generalization bound
in this setting and provide a theoretical interpretation of benign overfitting
by means of Perron-Frobenius operators. By virtue of $C^*$-algebra, the
dependency of the bound on output dimension is milder than existing bounds. We
show that $C^*$-algebra is a suitable tool for deep learning with kernels,
enabling us to take advantage of the product structure of operators and to
provide a clear connection with convolutional neural networks. Our theoretical
analysis provides a new lens through which one can design and analyze deep

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This work introduces the first small-loss and gradual-variation regret bounds

bounds for online convex optimization with non-Lipschitz, non-smooth losses.
The algorithms we propose exhibit sublinear regret rates in the worst cases and
achieve logarithmic regrets when the data is &quot;easy,&quot; with per-iteration time
almost linear in the number of investment alternatives. The regret bounds are
derived using novel smoothness characterizations of the logarithmic loss, a
local norm-based analysis of following the regularized leader (FTRL) with
self-concordant regularizers, which are not necessarily barriers, and an
implicit variant of optimistic FTRL with the log-barrier.

<title>FedZero: Leveraging Renewable Excess Energy in Federated Learning. (arXiv:2305.15092v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15092</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning technique that
enables distributed model training across data silos or edge devices without
data sharing. Yet, FL inevitably introduces inefficiencies compared to
centralized model training, which will further increase the already high energy
usage and associated carbon emissions of machine learning in the future. One
idea to reduce FL&apos;s carbon footprint is to schedule training jobs based on the
availability of renewable excess energy that can occur at certain times and
places in the grid. However, in the presence of such volatile and unreliable
resources, existing FL schedulers cannot always ensure fast, efficient, and
fair trainings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose FedZero, an FL system that operates exclusively on renewable
excess energy and spare capacity of compute infrastructure to effectively
reduce a training&apos;s operational carbon emissions to zero. Using energy and load
forecasts, FedZero leverages the spatio-temporal availability of excess
resources by selecting clients for fast convergence and fair participation. Our
evaluation, based on real solar and load traces, shows that FedZero converges
significantly faster than existing approaches under the mentioned constraints
while consuming less energy. Furthermore, it is robust to forecasting errors
and scalable to tens of thousands of clients.

<title>C-STS: Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity. (arXiv:2305.15093v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15093</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Semantic textual similarity (STS), a cornerstone task in NLP, measures the
degree of similarity between a pair of sentences, and has broad application in
fields such as information retrieval and natural language understanding.
However, sentence similarity can be inherently ambiguous, depending on the
specific aspect of interest. We resolve this ambiguity by proposing a novel
task called Conditional STS (C-STS) which measures sentences&apos; similarity
conditioned on an feature described in natural language (hereon, condition). As
an example, the similarity between the sentences &quot;The NBA player shoots a
three-pointer.&quot; and &quot;A man throws a tennis ball into the air to serve.&quot; is
higher for the condition &quot;The motion of the ball&quot; (both upward) and lower for
&quot;The size of the ball&quot; (one large and one small). C-STS&apos;s advantages are
two-fold: (1) it reduces the subjectivity and ambiguity of STS and (2) enables
fine-grained language model evaluation through diverse natural language
conditions. We put several state-of-the-art models to the test, and even those
performing well on STS (e.g. SimCSE, Flan-T5, and GPT-4) find C-STS
challenging; all with Spearman correlation scores below 50. To encourage a more
comprehensive evaluation of semantic similarity and natural language
understanding, we make nearly 19K C-STS examples and code available for others
to train and test their models.

<title>Towards Revealing the Mystery behind Chain of Thought: A Theoretical Perspective. (arXiv:2305.15408v4 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15408</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have discovered that Chain-of-Thought prompting (CoT) can
dramatically improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs),
particularly when dealing with complex tasks involving mathematics or
reasoning. Despite the enormous empirical success, the underlying mechanisms
behind CoT and how it unlocks the potential of LLMs remain elusive. In this
paper, we take a first step towards theoretically answering these questions.
Specifically, we examine the expressivity of LLMs with CoT in solving
fundamental mathematical and decision-making problems. By using circuit
complexity theory, we first give impossibility results showing that
bounded-depth Transformers are unable to directly produce correct answers for
basic arithmetic/equation tasks unless the model size grows super-polynomially
with respect to the input length. In contrast, we then prove by construction
that autoregressive Transformers of constant size suffice to solve both tasks
by generating CoT derivations using a commonly used math language format.
Moreover, we show LLMs with CoT can handle a general class of decision-making
problems known as Dynamic Programming, thus justifying its power in tackling
complex real-world tasks. Finally, an extensive set of experiments show that,
while Transformers always fail to directly predict the answers, they can
consistently learn to generate correct solutions step-by-step given sufficient
CoT demonstrations.

<title>Adaptive Data Analysis in a Balanced Adversarial Model. (arXiv:2305.15452v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15452</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In adaptive data analysis, a mechanism gets $n$ i.i.d. samples from an
unknown distribution $D$, and is required to provide accurate estimations to a
sequence of adaptively chosen statistical queries with respect to $D$. Hardt
and Ullman (FOCS 2014) and Steinke and Ullman (COLT 2015) showed that in
general, it is computationally hard to answer more than $\Theta(n^2)$ adaptive
queries, assuming the existence of one-way functions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, these negative results strongly rely on an adversarial model that
significantly advantages the adversarial analyst over the mechanism, as the
analyst, who chooses the adaptive queries, also chooses the underlying
distribution $D$. This imbalance raises questions with respect to the
applicability of the obtained hardness results -- an analyst who has complete
knowledge of the underlying distribution $D$ would have little need, if at all,
to issue statistical queries to a mechanism which only holds a finite number of
samples from $D$.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We consider more restricted adversaries, called \emph{balanced}, where each
such adversary consists of two separated algorithms: The \emph{sampler} who is
the entity that chooses the distribution and provides the samples to the
mechanism, and the \emph{analyst} who chooses the adaptive queries, but has no
prior knowledge of the underlying distribution (and hence has no a priori
advantage with respect to the mechanism). We improve the quality of previous
lower bounds by revisiting them using an efficient \emph{balanced} adversary,
under standard public-key cryptography assumptions. We show that these stronger
hardness assumptions are unavoidable in the sense that any computationally
bounded \emph{balanced} adversary that has the structure of all known attacks,
implies the existence of public-key cryptography.

the fixed confidence setting, notably showing its asymptotic optimality in
combination with an adaptive tuning of its exploration parameter. We complement
these findings with upper bounds on its probability of error at any time and
for any error parameter, which further yield upper bounds on its simple regret

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) enable 3D scene reconstruction from 2D images
and camera poses for Novel View Synthesis (NVS). Although NeRF can produce
photorealistic results, it often suffers from overfitting to training views,
leading to poor geometry reconstruction, especially in low-texture areas. This
limitation restricts many important applications which require accurate
geometry, such as extrapolated NVS, HD mapping and scene editing. To address
this limitation, we propose a new method to improve NeRF&apos;s 3D structure using
only RGB images and semantic maps. Our approach introduces a novel plane
regularization based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), that does not rely
on any geometric prior. In addition, we leverage the Structural Similarity
Index Measure (SSIM) in our loss design to properly initialize the volumetric
representation of NeRF. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our
method outperforms popular regularization approaches in accurate geometry
reconstruction for large-scale outdoor scenes and achieves SoTA rendering
quality on the KITTI-360 NVS benchmark.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Wasserstein distributionally robust estimators have emerged as powerful
models for prediction and decision-making under uncertainty. These estimators
provide attractive generalization guarantees: the robust objective obtained
from the training distribution is an exact upper bound on the true risk with
high probability. However, existing guarantees either suffer from the curse of
dimensionality, are restricted to specific settings, or lead to spurious error
terms. In this paper, we show that these generalization guarantees actually
hold on general classes of models, do not suffer from the curse of

prove that these results carry over to the newly-introduced regularized

<title>Gaussian Process Probes (GPP) for Uncertainty-Aware Probing. (arXiv:2305.18213v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18213</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Understanding which concepts models can and cannot represent has been
fundamental to many tasks: from effective and responsible use of models to
detecting out of distribution data. We introduce Gaussian process probes (GPP),
a unified and simple framework for probing and measuring uncertainty about
concepts represented by models. As a Bayesian extension of linear probing
methods, GPP asks what kind of distribution over classifiers (of concepts) is
induced by the model. This distribution can be used to measure both what the
model represents and how confident the probe is about what the model
represents. GPP can be applied to any pre-trained model with vector
representations of inputs (e.g., activations). It does not require access to
training data, gradients, or the architecture. We validate GPP on datasets
containing both synthetic and real images. Our experiments show it can (1)
probe a model&apos;s representations of concepts even with a very small number of
examples, (2) accurately measure both epistemic uncertainty (how confident the
probe is) and aleatory uncertainty (how fuzzy the concepts are to the model),
and (3) detect out of distribution data using those uncertainty measures as
well as classic methods do. By using Gaussian processes to expand what probing
can offer, GPP provides a data-efficient, versatile and uncertainty-aware tool
for understanding and evaluating the capabilities of machine learning models.

<title>Active Vision Reinforcement Learning under Limited Visual Observability. (arXiv:2306.00975v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00975</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In this work, we investigate Active Vision Reinforcement Learning
(ActiveVision-RL), where an embodied agent simultaneously learns action policy
for the task while also controlling its visual observations in partially
observable environments. We denote the former as motor policy and the latter as
sensory policy. For example, humans solve real world tasks by hand manipulation
(motor policy) together with eye movements (sensory policy). ActiveVision-RL
poses challenges on coordinating two policies given their mutual influence. We
propose SUGARL, Sensorimotor Understanding Guided Active Reinforcement
Learning, a framework that models motor and sensory policies separately, but
jointly learns them using with an intrinsic sensorimotor reward. This learnable
reward is assigned by sensorimotor reward module, incentivizes the sensory
policy to select observations that are optimal to infer its own motor action,
inspired by the sensorimotor stage of humans. Through a series of experiments,
we show the effectiveness of our method across a range of observability
conditions and its adaptability to existed RL algorithms. The sensory policies
learned through our method are observed to exhibit effective active vision
strategies.

<title>DiffLoad: Uncertainty Quantification in Load Forecasting with Diffusion Model. (arXiv:2306.01001v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01001</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Electrical load forecasting plays a crucial role in decision-making for power
systems, including unit commitment and economic dispatch. The integration of
renewable energy sources and the occurrence of external events, such as the
COVID-19 pandemic, have rapidly increased uncertainties in load forecasting.
The uncertainties in load forecasting can be divided into two types: epistemic
uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty. Separating these types of uncertainties
can help decision-makers better understand where and to what extent the
uncertainty is, thereby enhancing their confidence in the following
decision-making. This paper proposes a diffusion-based Seq2Seq structure to
estimate epistemic uncertainty and employs the robust additive Cauchy
distribution to estimate aleatoric uncertainty. Our method not only ensures the
accuracy of load forecasting but also demonstrates the ability to separate the
two types of uncertainties and be applicable to different levels of loads. The
relevant code can be found at

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Interatomic potentials learned using machine learning methods have been

extract a feature map from GNNs pre-trained on the OC20 dataset and use it to
learn the potential energy surface from system-specific datasets of catalytic

chemical species information, resulting in improved performance and
interpretability. We test our approach on a series of realistic datasets of
increasing complexity, showing excellent generalization and transferability

<title>Evaluating Language Models for Mathematics through Interactions. (arXiv:2306.01694v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01694</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;There is much excitement about the opportunity to harness the power of large
language models (LLMs) when building problem-solving assistants. However, the
standard methodology of evaluating LLMs relies on static pairs of inputs and
outputs, and is insufficient for making an informed decision about which LLMs
and under which assistive settings can they be sensibly used. Static assessment
fails to account for the essential interactive element in LLM deployment, and
therefore limits how we understand language model capabilities. We introduce
CheckMate, an adaptable prototype platform for humans to interact with and
evaluate LLMs. We conduct a study with CheckMate to evaluate three language
models (InstructGPT, ChatGPT, and GPT-4) as assistants in proving
undergraduate-level mathematics, with a mixed cohort of participants from
undergraduate students to professors of mathematics. We release the resulting
interaction and rating dataset, MathConverse. By analysing MathConverse, we
derive a taxonomy of human behaviours and uncover that despite a generally
positive correlation, there are notable instances of divergence between
correctness and perceived helpfulness in LLM generations, amongst other
findings. Further, we garner a more granular understanding of GPT-4
mathematical problem-solving through a series of case studies, contributed by
expert mathematicians. We conclude with actionable takeaways for ML
practitioners and mathematicians: models that communicate uncertainty respond
well to user corrections, and are more interpretable and concise may constitute
better assistants. Interactive evaluation is a promising way to navigate the
capability of these models; humans should be aware of language models&apos;
algebraic fallibility and discern where they are appropriate to use.

<title>GAD-NR: Graph Anomaly Detection via Neighborhood Reconstruction. (arXiv:2306.01951v5 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01951</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) is a technique used to identify abnormal nodes
within graphs, finding applications in network security, fraud detection,
social media spam detection, and various other domains. A common method for GAD
is Graph Auto-Encoders (GAEs), which encode graph data into node
representations and identify anomalies by assessing the reconstruction quality
of the graphs based on these representations. However, existing GAE models are
primarily optimized for direct link reconstruction, resulting in nodes
connected in the graph being clustered in the latent space. As a result, they
excel at detecting cluster-type structural anomalies but struggle with more
complex structural anomalies that do not conform to clusters. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel solution called GAD-NR, a new variant of GAE
that incorporates neighborhood reconstruction for graph anomaly detection.
GAD-NR aims to reconstruct the entire neighborhood of a node, encompassing the
local structure, self-attributes, and neighbor attributes, based on the
corresponding node representation. By comparing the neighborhood reconstruction
loss between anomalous nodes and normal nodes, GAD-NR can effectively detect
any anomalies. Extensive experimentation conducted on six real-world datasets
validates the effectiveness of GAD-NR, showcasing significant improvements (by
up to 30% in AUC) over state-of-the-art competitors. The source code for GAD-NR
is openly available. Importantly, the comparative analysis reveals that the
existing methods perform well only in detecting one or two types of anomalies
out of the three types studied. In contrast, GAD-NR excels at detecting all
three types of anomalies across the datasets, demonstrating its comprehensive
anomaly detection capabilities.

<title>Finding Counterfactually Optimal Action Sequences in Continuous State Spaces. (arXiv:2306.03929v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03929</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Whenever a clinician reflects on the efficacy of a sequence of treatment
decisions for a patient, they may try to identify critical time steps where,
had they made different decisions, the patient&apos;s health would have improved.
While recent methods at the intersection of causal inference and reinforcement
learning promise to aid human experts, as the clinician above, to
retrospectively analyze sequential decision making processes, they have focused
on environments with finitely many discrete states. However, in many practical
applications, the state of the environment is inherently continuous in nature.
In this paper, we aim to fill this gap. We start by formally characterizing a
sequence of discrete actions and continuous states using finite horizon Markov
decision processes and a broad class of bijective structural causal models.
Building upon this characterization, we formalize the problem of finding
counterfactually optimal action sequences and show that, in general, we cannot
expect to solve it in polynomial time. Then, we develop a search method based
on the $A^*$ algorithm that, under a natural form of Lipschitz continuity of
the environment&apos;s dynamics, is guaranteed to return the optimal solution to the
problem. Experiments on real clinical data show that our method is very
efficient in practice, and it has the potential to offer interesting insights
for sequential decision making tasks.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that allows a model to be
trained across a number of participants without sharing data. Recent works have
begun to consider the effects of using pre-trained models as an initialization
point for existing FL algorithms; however, these approaches ignore the vast
body of efficient transfer learning literature from the centralized learning
setting. Here we revisit the problem of FL from a pre-trained model considered
in prior work and expand it to a set of computer vision transfer learning
problems. We first observe that simply fitting a linear classification head can
be efficient and effective in many cases. We then show that in the FL setting,
fitting a classifier using the Nearest Class Means (NCM) can be done exactly
and orders of magnitude more efficiently than existing proposals, while
obtaining strong performance. Finally, we demonstrate that using a two-phase
approach of obtaining the classifier and then fine-tuning the model can yield
rapid convergence and improved generalization in the federated setting. We
demonstrate the potential our method has to reduce communication and compute
costs while achieving better model performance.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Numerous benchmarks have been established to assess the performance of
foundation models on open-ended question answering, which serves as a
comprehensive test of a model&apos;s ability to understand and generate language in
a manner similar to humans. Most of these works focus on proposing new
datasets, however, we see two main issues within previous benchmarking
pipelines, namely testing leakage and evaluation automation. In this paper, we
propose a novel benchmarking framework, Language-Model-as-an-Examiner, where
the LM serves as a knowledgeable examiner that formulates questions based on
its knowledge and evaluates responses in a reference-free manner. Our framework
allows for effortless extensibility as various LMs can be adopted as the
examiner, and the questions can be constantly updated given more diverse
trigger topics. For a more comprehensive and equitable evaluation, we devise
three strategies: (1) We instruct the LM examiner to generate questions across
a multitude of domains to probe for a broad acquisition, and raise follow-up
questions to engage in a more in-depth assessment. (2) Upon evaluation, the
examiner combines both scoring and ranking measurements, providing a reliable
result as it aligns closely with human annotations. (3) We additionally propose
a decentralized Peer-examination method to address the biases in a single
examiner. Our data and benchmarking results are available at:

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) allows to update pre-trained models to changing
data distributions at deployment time. While early work tested these algorithms
for individual fixed distribution shifts, recent work proposed and applied
methods for continual adaptation over long timescales. To examine the reported
progress in the field, we propose the Continually Changing Corruptions (CCC)
benchmark to measure asymptotic performance of TTA techniques. We find that
eventually all but one state-of-the-art methods collapse and perform worse than
a non-adapting model, including models specifically proposed to be robust to
performance collapse. In addition, we introduce a simple baseline, &quot;RDumb&quot;,
that periodically resets the model to its pretrained state. RDumb performs
better or on par with the previously proposed state-of-the-art in all
considered benchmarks. Our results show that previous TTA approaches are
neither effective at regularizing adaptation to avoid collapse nor able to
outperform a simplistic resetting strategy.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Unsupervised machine learning models build an internal representation of
their training data without the need for explicit human guidance or feature
engineering. This learned representation provides insights into which features
of the data are relevant for the task at hand. In the context of quantum
physics, training models to describe quantum states without human intervention
offers a promising approach to gaining insight into how machines represent
complex quantum states. The ability to interpret the learned representation may
offer a new perspective on non-trivial features of quantum systems and their
efficient representation. We train a generative model on two-qubit density
matrices generated by a parameterized quantum circuit. In a series of
computational experiments, we investigate the learned representation of the
model and its internal understanding of the data. We observe that the model
learns an interpretable representation which relates the quantum states to
their underlying entanglement characteristics. In particular, our results
demonstrate that the latent representation of the model is directly correlated
with the entanglement measure concurrence. The insights from this study
represent proof of concept towards interpretable machine learning of quantum
states. Our approach offers insight into how machines learn to represent
small-scale quantum systems autonomously.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Latent diffusion models (LDMs) exhibit an impressive ability to produce
realistic images, yet the inner workings of these models remain mysterious.
Even when trained purely on images without explicit depth information, they
typically output coherent pictures of 3D scenes. In this work, we investigate a
basic interpretability question: does an LDM create and use an internal
representation of simple scene geometry? Using linear probes, we find evidence
that the internal activations of the LDM encode linear representations of both
3D depth data and a salient-object / background distinction. These
representations appear surprisingly early in the denoising process$-$well
before a human can easily make sense of the noisy images. Intervention
experiments further indicate these representations play a causal role in image
synthesis, and may be used for simple high-level editing of an LDM&apos;s output.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods (e.g., SimCLR, DINO,
VICReg,MOCOv3) target primarily on representations at instance level and do not
generalize well to dense prediction tasks, such as object detection and

demonstrates for the first time the underlying mean-shift clustering process of
Vision Transformers (ViT), which aligns well with natural image semantics
(e.g., a world of objects and stuffs). By employing transformer for joint
embedding and clustering, we propose a two-level feature clustering SSL method,
coined Feature-Level Self-supervised Learning (FLSL). We present the formal
definition of the FLSL problem and construct the objectives from the mean-shift
and k-means perspectives. We show that FLSL promotes remarkable semantic
cluster representations and learns an embedding scheme amenable to intra-view
and inter-view feature clustering. Experiments show that FLSL yields
significant improvements in dense prediction tasks, achieving 44.9 (+2.8)% AP
and 46.5% AP in object detection, as well as 40.8 (+2.3)% AP and 42.1% AP in
instance segmentation on MS-COCO, using Mask R-CNN with ViT-S/16 and ViT-S/8 as
backbone, respectively. FLSL consistently outperforms existing SSL methods
across additional benchmarks, including UAV17 object detection on UAVDT, and
video instance segmentation on DAVIS 2017.We conclude by presenting
visualization and various ablation studies to better understand the success of
FLSL. The source code is available at https://github.com/ISL-CV/FLSL.

addressing the challenges of task sequencing and path planning in complex

relocation regions, and pairs them with available robots under kinematic
feasibility and task reachability for execution to achieve the target
arrangement. Our experiments on a diverse range of simulated and real-world

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06874</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Diffusion Models (DMs) are state-of-the-art generative models that learn a
reversible corruption process from iterative noise addition and denoising. They
are the backbone of many generative AI applications, such as text-to-image
conditional generation. However, recent studies have shown that basic
unconditional DMs (e.g., DDPM and DDIM) are vulnerable to backdoor injection, a
type of output manipulation attack triggered by a maliciously embedded pattern
at model input. This paper presents a unified backdoor attack framework
(VillanDiffusion) to expand the current scope of backdoor analysis for DMs. Our
framework covers mainstream unconditional and conditional DMs (denoising-based
and score-based) and various training-free samplers for holistic evaluations.
Experiments show that our unified framework facilitates the backdoor analysis
of different DM configurations and provides new insights into caption-based
backdoor attacks on DMs. Our code is available on GitHub:

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Despite the remarkable performance of text-to-image diffusion models in image
generation tasks, recent studies have raised the issue that generated images
sometimes cannot capture the intended semantic contents of the text prompts,
which phenomenon is often called semantic misalignment. To address this, here
we present a novel energy-based model (EBM) framework for adaptive context
control by modeling the posterior of context vectors. Specifically, we first
formulate EBMs of latent image representations and text embeddings in each
cross-attention layer of the denoising autoencoder. Then, we obtain the
gradient of the log posterior of context vectors, which can be updated and
transferred to the subsequent cross-attention layer, thereby implicitly
minimizing a nested hierarchy of energy functions. Our latent EBMs further
allow zero-shot compositional generation as a linear combination of
cross-attention outputs from different contexts. Using extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that the proposed method is highly effective in handling various
image generation tasks, including multi-concept generation, text-guided image
inpainting, and real and synthetic image editing. Code:

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10915</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs) are a class of metalearning models
popular for combining the runtime efficiency of amortized inference with
reliable uncertainty quantification. Many relevant machine learning tasks, such
as in spatio-temporal modeling, Bayesian Optimization and continuous control,
inherently contain equivariances -- for example to translation -- which the
model can exploit for maximal performance. However, prior attempts to include
equivariances in CNPs do not scale effectively beyond two input dimensions. In
this work, we propose Relational Conditional Neural Processes (RCNPs), an
effective approach to incorporate equivariances into any neural process model.
Our proposed method extends the applicability and impact of equivariant neural
processes to higher dimensions. We empirically demonstrate the competitive
performance of RCNPs on a large array of tasks naturally containing
equivariances.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Temporal hypergraphs provide a powerful paradigm for modeling time-dependent,
higher-order interactions in complex systems. Representation learning for
hypergraphs is essential for extracting patterns of the higher-order
interactions that are critically important in real-world problems in social
network analysis, neuroscience, finance, etc. However, existing methods are
typically designed only for specific tasks or static hypergraphs. We present
CAT-Walk, an inductive method that learns the underlying dynamic laws that
govern the temporal and structural processes underlying a temporal hypergraph.
CAT-Walk introduces a temporal, higher-order walk on hypergraphs, SetWalk, that
extracts higher-order causal patterns. CAT-Walk uses a novel adaptive and
permutation invariant pooling strategy, SetMixer, along with a set-based
anonymization process that hides the identity of hyperedges. Finally, we
present a simple yet effective neural network model to encode hyperedges. Our
evaluation on 10 hypergraph benchmark datasets shows that CAT-Walk attains
outstanding performance on temporal hyperedge prediction benchmarks in both
inductive and transductive settings. It also shows competitive performance with
state-of-the-art methods for node classification.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Recent hybrid models combining Linear State Space Models (SSMs) with
self-attention mechanisms have demonstrated impressive results across a range
of sequence modeling tasks. However, current approaches apply attention modules
statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to
sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. To address this limitation, we
introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural
networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements
in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated
sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption of neural networks
at both training and inference stages. To validate the effectiveness of SMA on
sequence modeling, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which
employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the
state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only
conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear
inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide
substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based
models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including long sequence
modeling, speech classification and language modeling, SeqBoat brings new
state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity, and
reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse
activation patterns. Our code is publicly available at

<title>Is RLHF More Difficult than Standard RL?. (arXiv:2306.14111v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14111</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) learns from preference
signals, while standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) directly learns from reward
signals. Preferences arguably contain less information than rewards, which
makes preference-based RL seemingly more difficult. This paper theoretically
proves that, for a wide range of preference models, we can solve
preference-based RL directly using existing algorithms and techniques for
reward-based RL, with small or no extra costs. Specifically, (1) for
preferences that are drawn from reward-based probabilistic models, we reduce
the problem to robust reward-based RL that can tolerate small errors in
rewards; (2) for general arbitrary preferences where the objective is to find
the von Neumann winner, we reduce the problem to multiagent reward-based RL
which finds Nash equilibria for factored Markov games with a restricted set of
policies. The latter case can be further reduced to adversarial MDP when
preferences only depend on the final state. We instantiate all reward-based RL
subroutines by concrete provable algorithms, and apply our theory to a large
class of models including tabular MDPs and MDPs with generic function
approximation. We further provide guarantees when K-wise comparisons are

<title>Reduce Computational Complexity for Convolutional Layers by Skipping Zeros. (arXiv:2306.15951v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15951</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Convolutional neural networks necessitate good algorithms to reduce
complexity, and sufficient utilization of parallel processors for acceleration.
Within convolutional layers, there are three types of operators: convolution
used in forward propagation, deconvolution and dilated-convolution utilized in
backward propagation. During the execution of these operators, zeros are
typically added to tensors, leading to redundant calculations and unnecessary
strain on hardware. To circumvent these inefficiencies, we propose the C-K-S
algorithm, accompanied by efficient GPU implementations. C-K-S trims filters to
exclude zero-padding. For deconvolution and dilated-convolution, C-K-S
transforms sparse tensors into dense tensors, and standardizes the local
computational rules to simplify the hardware control. The experimental results
demonstrate that C-K-S offers good performance in terms of speed and
convergence, surpassing the capabilities of PyTorch and cuDNN in certain
scenarios.

development of the \emph{Controlled Monte Carlo Diffusion} sampler (CMCD) for
Bayesian computation, a score-based annealing technique that crucially adapts
both forward and backward dynamics in a diffusion model. On the way, we clarify
the relationship between the EM-algorithm and iterative proportional fitting
(IPF) for Schr{\&quot;o}dinger bridges, deriving as well a regularised objective
that bypasses the iterative bottleneck of standard IPF-updates. Finally, we
show that CMCD has a strong foundation in the Jarzinsky and Crooks identities

<title>Towards Symmetry-Aware Generation of Periodic Materials. (arXiv:2307.02707v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02707</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We consider the problem of generating periodic materials with deep models.
While symmetry-aware molecule generation has been studied extensively, periodic
materials possess different symmetries, which have not been completely captured
by existing methods. In this work, we propose SyMat, a novel material
generation approach that can capture physical symmetries of periodic material
structures. SyMat generates atom types and lattices of materials through
generating atom type sets, lattice lengths and lattice angles with a
variational auto-encoder model. In addition, SyMat employs a score-based
diffusion model to generate atom coordinates of materials, in which a novel
symmetry-aware probabilistic model is used in the coordinate diffusion process.
We show that SyMat is theoretically invariant to all symmetry transformations
on materials and demonstrate that SyMat achieves promising performance on
random generation and property optimization tasks. Our code is publicly
available as part of the AIRS library (https://github.com/divelab/AIRS).

<title>DEDUCE: Multi-head attention decoupled contrastive learning to discover cancer subtypes based on multi-omics data. (arXiv:2307.04075v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04075</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Due to the high heterogeneity and clinical characteristics of cancer, there
are significant differences in multi-omics data and clinical features among
subtypes of different cancers. Therefore, the identification and discovery of
cancer subtypes are crucial for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of
cancer. In this study, we proposed a generalization framework based on
attention mechanisms for unsupervised contrastive learning to analyze cancer
multi-omics data for the identification and characterization of cancer
subtypes. The framework contains a symmetric unsupervised multi-head attention
encoder, which can deeply extract contextual features and long-range
dependencies of multi-omics data, reducing the impact of noise in multi-omics
data. Importantly, the proposed framework includes a decoupled contrastive
learning model (DEDUCE) based on a multi-head attention mechanism to learn
multi-omics data features and clustering and identify cancer subtypes. This
method clusters subtypes by calculating the similarity between samples in the
feature space and sample space of multi-omics data. The basic idea is to
decouple different attributes of multi-omics data features and learn them as
contrasting terms. Construct a contrastive loss function to measure the
difference between positive examples and negative examples, and minimize this
difference, thereby encouraging the model to learn better feature
representation. The DEDUCE model conducts large-scale experiments on simulated
multi-omics data sets, single-cell multi-omics data sets and cancer multi-omics
data sets, and the results are better than 10 deep learning models. Finally, we
used the DEDUCE model to reveal six cancer subtypes of AML. By analyzing GO

<title>A Novel Site-Agnostic Multimodal Deep Learning Model to Identify Pro-Eating Disorder Content on Social Media. (arXiv:2307.06775v4 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06775</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, there has been a vast increase in eating disorder
diagnoses and eating disorder-attributed deaths, reaching their zenith during
the Covid-19 pandemic. This immense growth derived in part from the stressors
of the pandemic but also from increased exposure to social media, which is rife
with content that promotes eating disorders. This study aimed to create a
multimodal deep learning model that can determine if a given social media post
promotes eating disorders based on a combination of visual and textual data. A
labeled dataset of Tweets was collected from Twitter, recently rebranded as X,
upon which twelve deep learning models were trained and evaluated. Based on
model performance, the most effective deep learning model was the multimodal
fusion of the RoBERTa natural language processing model and the MaxViT image
classification model, attaining accuracy and F1 scores of 95.9% and 0.959,
respectively. The RoBERTa and MaxViT fusion model, deployed to classify an
unlabeled dataset of posts from the social media sites Tumblr and Reddit,
generated results akin to those of previous research studies that did not
employ artificial intelligence-based techniques, indicating that deep learning
models can develop insights congruent to those of researchers. Additionally,
the model was used to conduct a time-series analysis of yet unseen Tweets from
eight Twitter hashtags, uncovering that, since 2014, the relative abundance of
content that promotes eating disorders has decreased drastically within those
communities. Despite this reduction, by 2018, content that promotes eating
disorders had either stopped declining or increased in ampleness anew on those
hashtags.

learning for task and motion planning (TAMP), which endows our learner with the
compositionality of TAMP systems. Exploiting the modularity of TAMP, we develop
a mixture of generative models that produces candidate continuous parameters
for a planner. Whereas most existing lifelong learning approaches determine a
priori how data is shared across various models, our approach learns shared and
non-shared models and determines which to use online during planning based on
auxiliary tasks that serve as a proxy for each model&apos;s understanding of a
state. Our method exhibits substantial improvements (over time and compared to
baselines) in planning success on 2D and BEHAVIOR domains.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Sequential data collection has emerged as a widely adopted technique for
enhancing the efficiency of data gathering processes. Despite its advantages,
such data collection mechanism often introduces complexities to the statistical
inference procedure. For instance, the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator
in an adaptive linear regression model can exhibit non-normal asymptotic
behavior, posing challenges for accurate inference and interpretation. In this
paper, we propose a general method for constructing debiased estimator which
remedies this issue. It makes use of the idea of adaptive linear estimating
equations, and we establish theoretical guarantees of asymptotic normality,
supplemented by discussions on achieving near-optimal asymptotic variance. A
salient feature of our estimator is that in the context of multi-armed bandits,
our estimator retains the non-asymptotic performance of the least square
estimator while obtaining asymptotic normality property. Consequently, this
work helps connect two fruitful paradigms of adaptive inference: a)
non-asymptotic inference using concentration inequalities and b) asymptotic
inference via asymptotic normality.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We focus on developing efficient and reliable policy optimization strategies
for robot learning with real-world data. In recent years, policy gradient
methods have emerged as a promising paradigm for training control policies in
simulation. However, these approaches often remain too data inefficient or
unreliable to train on real robotic hardware. In this paper we introduce a
novel policy gradient-based policy optimization framework which systematically
leverages a (possibly highly simplified) first-principles model and enables
learning precise control policies with limited amounts of real-world data. Our
approach $1)$ uses the derivatives of the model to produce sample-efficient
estimates of the policy gradient and $2)$ uses the model to design a low-level
tracking controller, which is embedded in the policy class. Theoretical
analysis provides insight into how the presence of this feedback controller
overcomes key limitations of stand-alone policy gradient methods, while
hardware experiments with a small car and quadruped demonstrate that our
approach can learn precise control strategies reliably and with only minutes of

<title>A Theory for Emergence of Complex Skills in Language Models. (arXiv:2307.15936v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15936</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;A major driver of AI products today is the fact that new skills emerge in
language models when their parameter set and training corpora are scaled up.
This phenomenon is poorly understood, and a mechanistic explanation via
mathematical analysis of gradient-based training seems difficult. The current
paper takes a different approach, analysing emergence using the famous (and
empirical) Scaling Laws of LLMs and a simple statistical framework.
Contributions include: (a) A statistical framework that relates cross-entropy
loss of LLMs to competence on the basic skills that underlie language tasks.
(b) Mathematical analysis showing that the Scaling Laws imply a strong form of
inductive bias that allows the pre-trained model to learn very efficiently. We
informally call this {\em slingshot generalization} since naively viewed it
appears to give competence levels at skills that violate usual generalization
theory. (c) A key example of slingshot generalization, that competence at
executing tasks involving $k$-tuples of skills emerges essentially at the same
scaling and same rate as competence on the elementary skills themselves.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Floods are one of the most common natural disasters, with a disproportionate
impact in developing countries that often lack dense streamflow gauge networks.
Accurate and timely warnings are critical for mitigating flood risks, but
hydrological simulation models typically must be calibrated to long data
records in each watershed. Using AI, we achieve reliability in predicting
extreme riverine events in ungauged watersheds at up to a 5-day lead time that
is similar to or better than the reliability of nowcasts (0-day lead time) from
a current state of the art global modeling system (the Copernicus Emergency
Management Service Global Flood Awareness System). Additionally, we achieve
accuracies over 5-year return period events that are similar to or better than
current accuracies over 1-year return period events. This means that AI can
provide flood warnings earlier and over larger and more impactful events in
ungauged basins. The model developed in this paper was incorporated into an
operational early warning system that produces publicly available (free and
open) forecasts in real time in over 80 countries. This work highlights a need
for increasing the availability of hydrological data to continue to improve

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We investigate the online overlapping batch-means covariance estimator for
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) under Markovian sampling. Convergence rates
of order $O\big(\sqrt{d}\,n^{-1/8}(\log n)^{1/4}\big)$ and
$O\big(\sqrt{d}\,n^{-1/8}\big)$ are established under state-dependent and
state-independent Markovian sampling, respectively, where $d$ is the
dimensionality and $n$ denotes observations or SGD iterations. These rates
match the best-known convergence rate for independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d) data. Our analysis overcomes significant challenges that
arise due to Markovian sampling, leading to the introduction of additional
error terms and complex dependencies between the blocks of the batch-means
covariance estimator. Moreover, we establish the convergence rate for the first
four moments of the $\ell_2$ norm of the error of SGD dynamics under
state-dependent Markovian data, which holds potential interest as an
independent result. Numerical illustrations provide confidence intervals for
SGD in linear and logistic regression models under Markovian sampling.
Additionally, our method is applied to the strategic classification with
logistic regression, where adversaries adaptively modify features during
training to affect target class classification.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In the growing domain of scientific machine learning, in-context operator
learning has shown notable potential in learning operators and solving
differential equations using prompted data, during the inference stage without
weight updates. However, the current model&apos;s overdependence on function data,
may inadvertently overlook the invaluable human insight into the operator. To
address this, we present a transformation of in-context operator learning into
a multi-modal paradigm. In particular, we take inspiration from the recent
success of large language models, and propose using &quot;captions&quot; to integrate
human knowledge about the operator, expressed through natural language
descriptions and equations. Also, we introduce a novel approach to train a
language-model-like architecture, or directly fine-tune existing language
models, for in-context operator learning. We beat the baseline on single-modal
learning tasks, and also demonstrated the effectiveness of multi-modal learning
in enhancing performance and reducing function data requirements. The proposed
method not only significantly improves in-context operator learning, but also
creates a new path for the application of language models.

<title>Complex Facial Expression Recognition Using Deep Knowledge Distillation of Basic Features. (arXiv:2308.06197v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06197</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Complex emotion recognition is a cognitive task that has so far eluded the
same excellent performance of other tasks that are at or above the level of
human cognition. Emotion recognition through facial expressions is particularly
difficult due to the complexity of emotions expressed by the human face. For a
machine to approach the same level of performance in complex facial expression
recognition as a human, it may need to synthesise knowledge and understand new
concepts in real-time, as humans do. Humans are able to learn new concepts
using only few examples by distilling important information from memories.
Inspired by human cognition and learning, we propose a novel continual learning
method for complex facial expression recognition that can accurately recognise
new compound expression classes using few training samples, by building on and
retaining its knowledge of basic expression classes. In this work, we also use
GradCAM visualisations to demonstrate the relationship between basic and
compound facial expressions. Our method leverages this relationship through
knowledge distillation and a novel Predictive Sorting Memory Replay, to achieve
the current state-of-the-art in continual learning for complex facial
expression recognition, with 74.28% Overall Accuracy on new classes. We also
demonstrate that using continual learning for complex facial expression
recognition achieves far better performance than non-continual learning
methods, improving on state-of-the-art non-continual learning methods by
13.95%. Our work is also the first to apply few-shot learning to complex facial
expression recognition, achieving the state-of-the-art with 100% accuracy using
only a single training sample per class.

<title>Adapt Your Teacher: Improving Knowledge Distillation for Exemplar-free Continual Learning. (arXiv:2308.09544v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09544</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In this work, we investigate exemplar-free class incremental learning (CIL)
with knowledge distillation (KD) as a regularization strategy, aiming to
prevent forgetting. KD-based methods are successfully used in CIL, but they
often struggle to regularize the model without access to exemplars of the
training data from previous tasks. Our analysis reveals that this issue
originates from substantial representation shifts in the teacher network when
dealing with out-of-distribution data. This causes large errors in the KD loss
component, leading to performance degradation in CIL models. Inspired by recent
test-time adaptation methods, we introduce Teacher Adaptation (TA), a method
that concurrently updates the teacher and the main models during incremental
training. Our method seamlessly integrates with KD-based CIL approaches and
allows for consistent enhancement of their performance across multiple
exemplar-free CIL benchmarks. The source code for our method is available at
https://github.com/fszatkowski/cl-teacher-adaptation.

<title>Flamingo: Multi-Round Single-Server Secure Aggregation with Applications to Private Federated Learning. (arXiv:2308.09883v2 [cs.CR] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09883</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces Flamingo, a system for secure aggregation of data
across a large set of clients. In secure aggregation, a server sums up the
private inputs of clients and obtains the result without learning anything
about the individual inputs beyond what is implied by the final sum. Flamingo
focuses on the multi-round setting found in federated learning in which many
consecutive summations (averages) of model weights are performed to derive a
good model. Previous protocols, such as Bell et al. (CCS &apos;20), have been
designed for a single round and are adapted to the federated learning setting
by repeating the protocol multiple times. Flamingo eliminates the need for the
per-round setup of previous protocols, and has a new lightweight dropout
resilience protocol to ensure that if clients leave in the middle of a sum the
server can still obtain a meaningful result. Furthermore, Flamingo introduces a
new way to locally choose the so-called client neighborhood introduced by Bell
et al. These techniques help Flamingo reduce the number of interactions between
clients and the server, resulting in a significant reduction in the end-to-end
runtime for a full training session over prior work. We implement and evaluate
Flamingo and show that it can securely train a neural network on the (Extended)
MNIST and CIFAR-100 datasets, and the model converges without a loss in
accuracy, compared to a non-private federated learning system.

<title>An Online Multiple Kernel Parallelizable Learning Scheme. (arXiv:2308.10101v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10101</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The performance of reproducing kernel Hilbert space-based methods is known to
be sensitive to the choice of the reproducing kernel. Choosing an adequate
reproducing kernel can be challenging and computationally demanding, especially
in data-rich tasks without prior information about the solution domain. In this
paper, we propose a learning scheme that scalably combines several single
kernel-based online methods to reduce the kernel-selection bias. The proposed
learning scheme applies to any task formulated as a regularized empirical risk
minimization convex problem. More specifically, our learning scheme is based on
a multi-kernel learning formulation that can be applied to widen any
single-kernel solution space, thus increasing the possibility of finding
higher-performance solutions. In addition, it is parallelizable, allowing for
the distribution of the computational load across different computing units. We
show experimentally that the proposed learning scheme outperforms the combined
single-kernel online methods separately in terms of the cumulative regularized
least squares cost metric.

<title>Low Tensor Rank Learning of Neural Dynamics. (arXiv:2308.11567v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11567</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Learning relies on coordinated synaptic changes in recurrently connected
populations of neurons. Therefore, understanding the collective evolution of
synaptic connectivity over learning is a key challenge in neuroscience and
machine learning. In particular, recent work has shown that the weight matrices
of task-trained RNNs are typically low rank, but how this low rank structure
unfolds over learning is unknown. To address this, we investigate the rank of
the 3-tensor formed by the weight matrices throughout learning. By fitting RNNs
of varying rank to large-scale neural recordings during a motor learning task,
we find that the inferred weights are low-tensor-rank and therefore evolve over
a fixed low-dimensional subspace throughout the entire course of learning. We
next validate the observation of low-tensor-rank learning on an RNN trained to
solve the same task. Finally, we present a set of mathematical results bounding
the matrix and tensor ranks of gradient descent learning dynamics which show
that low-tensor-rank weights emerge naturally in RNNs trained to solve
low-dimensional tasks. Taken together, our findings provide insight on the
evolution of population connectivity over learning in both biological and
artificial neural networks, and enable reverse engineering of learning-induced
changes in recurrent dynamics from large-scale neural recordings.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We study optimal data pooling for shared learning in two common maintenance

a set of systems subject to Poisson input -- the degradation or demand process
-- that are coupled through an a-priori unknown rate. Decision problems
involving these systems are high-dimensional Markov decision processes (MDPs)
and hence notoriously difficult to solve. We present a decomposition result
that reduces such an MDP to two-dimensional MDPs, enabling structural analyses
and computations. Leveraging this decomposition, we (i) demonstrate that
pooling data can lead to significant cost reductions compared to not pooling,
and (ii) show that the optimal policy for the condition-based maintenance
problem is a control limit policy, while for the spare parts management
problem, it is an order-up-to level policy, both dependent on the pooled data.

<title>Linear Oscillation: A Novel Activation Function for Vision Transformer. (arXiv:2308.13670v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13670</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Activation functions are the linchpins of deep learning, profoundly
influencing both the representational capacity and training dynamics of neural
networks. They shape not only the nature of representations but also optimize
convergence rates and enhance generalization potential. Appreciating this
critical role, we present the Linear Oscillation (LoC) activation function,
defined as $f(x) = x \times \sin(\alpha x + \beta)$. Distinct from conventional
activation functions which primarily introduce non-linearity, LoC seamlessly
blends linear trajectories with oscillatory deviations. The nomenclature
&quot;Linear Oscillation&quot; is a nod to its unique attribute of infusing linear
activations with harmonious oscillations, capturing the essence of the
&quot;Importance of Confusion&quot;. This concept of &quot;controlled confusion&quot; within
network activations is posited to foster more robust learning, particularly in
contexts that necessitate discerning subtle patterns. Our empirical studies
reveal that, when integrated into diverse neural architectures, the LoC
activation function consistently outperforms established counterparts like ReLU
and Sigmoid. The stellar performance exhibited by the avant-garde Vision
Transformer model using LoC further validates its efficacy. This study
illuminates the remarkable benefits of the LoC over other prominent activation
functions. It champions the notion that intermittently introducing deliberate
complexity or &quot;confusion&quot; during training can spur more profound and nuanced
learning. This accentuates the pivotal role of judiciously selected activation
functions in shaping the future of neural network training.

<title>Detecting Language Model Attacks with Perplexity. (arXiv:2308.14132v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14132</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;A novel hack involving Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged, leveraging
adversarial suffixes to trick models into generating perilous responses. This
method has garnered considerable attention from reputable media outlets such as
the New York Times and Wired, thereby influencing public perception regarding
the security and safety of LLMs. In this study, we advocate the utilization of
perplexity as one of the means to recognize such potential attacks. The
underlying concept behind these hacks revolves around appending an unusually
constructed string of text to a harmful query that would otherwise be blocked.
This maneuver confuses the protective mechanisms and tricks the model into
generating a forbidden response. Such scenarios could result in providing
detailed instructions to a malicious user for constructing explosives or
orchestrating a bank heist. Our investigation demonstrates the feasibility of
employing perplexity, a prevalent natural language processing metric, to detect
these adversarial tactics before generating a forbidden response. By evaluating
the perplexity of queries with and without such adversarial suffixes using an
open-source LLM, we discovered that nearly 90 percent were above a perplexity
of 1000. This contrast underscores the efficacy of perplexity for detecting
this type of exploit.

<title>Rethinking the Power of Graph Canonization in Graph Representation Learning with Stability. (arXiv:2309.00738v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00738</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The expressivity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been studied broadly in
recent years to reveal the design principles for more powerful GNNs. Graph
canonization is known as a typical approach to distinguish non-isomorphic
graphs, yet rarely adopted when developing expressive GNNs. This paper proposes
to maximize the expressivity of GNNs by graph canonization, then the power of
such GNNs is studies from the perspective of model stability. A stable GNN will
map similar graphs to close graph representations in the vectorial space, and
the stability of GNNs is critical to generalize their performance to unseen
graphs. We theoretically reveal the trade-off of expressivity and stability in
graph-canonization-enhanced GNNs. Then we introduce a notion of universal graph
canonization as the general solution to address the trade-off and characterize
a widely applicable sufficient condition to solve the universal graph
canonization. A comprehensive set of experiments demonstrates the effectiveness
of the proposed method. In many popular graph benchmark datasets, graph
canonization successfully enhances GNNs and provides highly competitive
performance, indicating the capability and great potential of proposed method
in general graph representation learning. In graph datasets where the
sufficient condition holds, GNNs enhanced by universal graph canonization
consistently outperform GNN baselines and successfully improve the SOTA
performance up to $31\%$, providing the optimal solution to numerous
challenging real-world graph analytical tasks like gene network representation
learning in bioinformatics.

incorporate ViT blocks into the decoder to emphasize high-fidelity details,

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are widely used to implement deep
learning inference. Standard deep neural network inference involves the
computation of interleaved linear maps and nonlinear activation functions.
Prior work for ultra-low latency implementations has hardcoded the combination
of linear maps and nonlinear activations inside FPGA lookup tables (LUTs). Our
work is motivated by the idea that the LUTs in an FPGA can be used to implement
a much greater variety of functions than this. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach to training neural networks for FPGA deployment using
multivariate polynomials as the basic building block. Our method takes
advantage of the flexibility offered by the soft logic, hiding the polynomial
evaluation inside the LUTs with minimal overhead. We show that by using
polynomial building blocks, we can achieve the same accuracy using considerably
fewer layers of soft logic than by using linear functions, leading to
significant latency and area improvements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
this approach in three tasks: network intrusion detection, jet identification
at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, and handwritten digit recognition using the
MNIST dataset.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Along with the proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs), optimizing the use

generalizable to wider unseen classes within the same dataset. In this work, we
present Prompt Learning with Reparameterization Encoder (PRE) - a simple and
efficient method that enhances the generalization ability of the learnable
prompt to unseen classes while maintaining the capacity to learn Base classes.
Instead of directly optimizing the prompts, PRE employs a prompt encoder to
reparameterize the input prompt embeddings, enhancing the exploration of
task-specific knowledge from few-shot samples. Experiments and extensive
ablation studies on 8 benchmarks demonstrate that our approach is an efficient
method for prompt learning. Specifically, PRE achieves a notable enhancement of
5.60% in average accuracy on New classes and 3% in Harmonic mean compared to
CoOp in the 16-shot setting, all achieved within a good training time.

<title>HINT: Healthy Influential-Noise based Training to Defend against Data Poisoning Attacks. (arXiv:2309.08549v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08549</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;While numerous defense methods have been proposed to prohibit potential
poisoning attacks from untrusted data sources, most research works only defend
against specific attacks, which leaves many avenues for an adversary to
exploit. In this work, we propose an efficient and robust training approach to
defend against data poisoning attacks based on influence functions, named
Healthy Influential-Noise based Training. Using influence functions, we craft
healthy noise that helps to harden the classification model against poisoning
attacks without significantly affecting the generalization ability on test
data. In addition, our method can perform effectively when only a subset of the
training data is modified, instead of the current method of adding noise to all
examples that has been used in several previous works. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations over two image datasets with state-of-the-art poisoning attacks
under different realistic attack scenarios. Our empirical results show that
HINT can efficiently protect deep learning models against the effect of both
untargeted and targeted poisoning attacks.

<title>Active Learning for Semantic Segmentation with Multi-class Label Query. (arXiv:2309.09319v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09319</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a new active learning method for semantic segmentation.
The core of our method lies in a new annotation query design. It samples
informative local image regions (e.g., superpixels), and for each of such
regions, asks an oracle for a multi-hot vector indicating all classes existing
in the region. This multi-class labeling strategy is substantially more
efficient than existing ones like segmentation, polygon, and even dominant
class labeling in terms of annotation time per click. However, it introduces
the class ambiguity issue in training as it assigns partial labels (i.e., a set
of candidate classes) to individual pixels. We thus propose a new algorithm for
learning semantic segmentation while disambiguating the partial labels in two
stages. In the first stage, it trains a segmentation model directly with the
partial labels through two new loss functions motivated by partial label
learning and multiple instance learning. In the second stage, it disambiguates
the partial labels by generating pixel-wise pseudo labels, which are used for
supervised learning of the model. Equipped with a new acquisition function
dedicated to the multi-class labeling, our method outperforms previous work on
Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 while spending less annotation cost. Our code
and results are available at https://github.com/sehyun03/MulActSeg.

<title>Spatial-frequency channels, shape bias, and adversarial robustness. (arXiv:2309.13190v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13190</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;What spatial frequency information do humans and neural networks use to
recognize objects? In neuroscience, critical band masking is an established
tool that can reveal the frequency-selective filters used for object
recognition. Critical band masking measures the sensitivity of recognition
performance to noise added at each spatial frequency. Existing critical band
masking studies show that humans recognize periodic patterns (gratings) and
letters by means of a spatial-frequency filter (or &quot;channel&quot;) that has a
frequency bandwidth of one octave (doubling of frequency). Here, we introduce
critical band masking as a task for network-human comparison and test 14 humans
and 76 neural networks on 16-way ImageNet categorization in the presence of
narrowband noise. We find that humans recognize objects in natural images using
the same one-octave-wide channel that they use for letters and gratings, making
it a canonical feature of human object recognition. Unlike humans, the neural
network channel is very broad, 2-4 times wider than the human channel. Thus,
noise at certain high and low frequencies will impair network performance and
spare human performance. Adversarial and augmented-image training are commonly
used to increase network robustness and shape bias. Does this training align
network and human object recognition channels? Three network channel properties
(bandwidth, center frequency, peak noise sensitivity) correlate strongly with
shape bias (51% variance explained) and robustness of adversarially-trained
networks (66% variance explained). Adversarial training increases robustness
but expands the channel bandwidth even further beyond the human bandwidth.
Thus, critical band masking reveals that the network channel is more than twice
as wide as the human channel, and that adversarial training only makes it
worse. Networks with narrower channels might be more robust.

Traditionally, customizing ACO for a specific problem requires the expert

heuristic designs. DeepACO serves to strengthen the heuristic measures of
existing ACO algorithms and dispense with laborious manual design in future ACO

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14118</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Predicting multiple real-world tasks in a single model often requires a
particularly diverse feature space. Multimodal (MM) models aim to extract the
synergistic predictive potential of multiple data types to create a shared
feature space with aligned semantic meaning across inputs of drastically
varying sizes (i.e. images, text, sound). Most current MM architectures fuse
these representations in parallel, which not only limits their interpretability
but also creates a dependency on modality availability. We present MultiModN, a
multimodal, modular network that fuses latent representations in a sequence of
any number, combination, or type of modality while providing granular real-time
predictive feedback on any number or combination of predictive tasks.
MultiModN&apos;s composable pipeline is interpretable-by-design, as well as innately
multi-task and robust to the fundamental issue of biased missingness. We
perform four experiments on several benchmark MM datasets across 10 real-world
tasks (predicting medical diagnoses, academic performance, and weather), and
show that MultiModN&apos;s sequential MM fusion does not compromise performance
compared with a baseline of parallel fusion. By simulating the challenging bias
of missing not-at-random (MNAR), this work shows that, contrary to MultiModN,
parallel fusion baselines erroneously learn MNAR and suffer catastrophic
failure when faced with different patterns of MNAR at inference. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first inherently MNAR-resistant approach to MM
modeling. In conclusion, MultiModN provides granular insights, robustness, and
flexibility without compromising performance.

<title>Uncertainty Quantification via Neural Posterior Principal Components. (arXiv:2309.15533v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15533</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty quantification is crucial for the deployment of image restoration
models in safety-critical domains, like autonomous driving and biological
imaging. To date, methods for uncertainty visualization have mainly focused on
per-pixel estimates. Yet, a heatmap of per-pixel variances is typically of
little practical use, as it does not capture the strong correlations between
pixels. A more natural measure of uncertainty corresponds to the variances
along the principal components (PCs) of the posterior distribution.
Theoretically, the PCs can be computed by applying PCA on samples generated
from a conditional generative model for the input image. However, this requires
generating a very large number of samples at test time, which is painfully slow
with the current state-of-the-art (diffusion) models. In this work, we present
a method for predicting the PCs of the posterior distribution for any input
image, in a single forward pass of a neural network. Our method can either wrap
around a pre-trained model that was trained to minimize the mean square error
(MSE), or can be trained from scratch to output both a predicted image and the
posterior PCs. We showcase our method on multiple inverse problems in imaging,
including denoising, inpainting, super-resolution, and biological
image-to-image translation. Our method reliably conveys instance-adaptive
uncertainty directions, achieving uncertainty quantification comparable with
posterior samplers while being orders of magnitude faster. Code and examples

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Adversarial examples in machine learning has emerged as a focal point of

between machine learning model complexity and Einstein&apos;s theory of special

primarily center on quantum entanglement, we instead define the entanglement
correlations we have discovered to be computational, and demonstrate that
distant feature samples can be entangled, strongly resembling entanglement

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16223</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Diverse explainability methods of graph neural networks (GNN) have recently
been developed to highlight the edges and nodes in the graph that contribute
the most to the model predictions. However, it is not clear yet how to evaluate
the correctness of those explanations, whether it is from a human or a model
perspective. One unaddressed bottleneck in the current evaluation procedure is
the problem of out-of-distribution explanations, whose distribution differs
from those of the training data. This important issue affects existing
evaluation metrics such as the popular faithfulness or fidelity score. In this
paper, we show the limitations of faithfulness metrics. We propose GInX-Eval
(Graph In-distribution eXplanation Evaluation), an evaluation procedure of
graph explanations that overcomes the pitfalls of faithfulness and offers new
insights on explainability methods. Using a fine-tuning strategy, the GInX
score measures how informative removed edges are for the model and the EdgeRank
score evaluates if explanatory edges are correctly ordered by their importance.
GInX-Eval verifies if ground-truth explanations are instructive to the GNN
model. In addition, it shows that many popular methods, including
gradient-based methods, produce explanations that are not better than a random
designation of edges as important subgraphs, challenging the findings of
current works in the area. Results with GInX-Eval are consistent across
multiple datasets and align with human evaluation.

The human body has bilateral symmetry and some variations in organ positions.
It allows us to expect a positive effect of rotation and inversion invariant

In this study, we show the impact of weight symmetry in neural networks that
perform 3D mesh segmentation. We analyze the problem of 3D mesh segmentation
for pathological vessel structures (aneurysms) and conventional anatomical
structures (endocardium and epicardium of ventricles). Local geometrical
features are encoded as sampling from the signed distance function, and the
neural network performs prediction for each mesh node. We show that weight
symmetry gains from 1 to 3% of additional accuracy and allows decreasing the

loss if neural networks have at least three convolutional layers. This also
works for very small training sets.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Large training sets have become a cornerstone of machine learning and are the
foundation for recent advances in language modeling and multimodal learning.
While data curation for pre-training is often still ad-hoc, one common paradigm
is to first collect a massive pool of data from the Web and then filter this
candidate pool down to an actual training set via various heuristics. In this
work, we study the problem of learning a data filtering network (DFN) for this
second step of filtering a large uncurated dataset. Our key finding is that the
quality of a network for filtering is distinct from its performance on
downstream tasks: for instance, a model that performs well on ImageNet can
yield worse training sets than a model with low ImageNet accuracy that is
trained on a small amount of high-quality data. Based on our insights, we
construct new data filtering networks that induce state-of-the-art image-text
datasets. Specifically, our best performing dataset DFN-5B enables us to train
state-of-the-art CLIP models for their compute budgets: among other
improvements on a variety of tasks, a ViT-H trained on our dataset achieves
84.4% zero-shot transfer accuracy on ImageNet, out-performing models trained on
other datasets such as LAION-2B, DataComp-1B, or OpenAI&apos;s WIT. In order to
facilitate further research in dataset design, we also release a new 2 billion
example dataset DFN-2B and show that high performance data filtering networks
can be trained from scratch using only publicly available data.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Fully automatic cardiac segmentation can be a fast and reproducible method to
extract clinical measurements from an echocardiography examination. The U-Net
architecture is the current state-of-the-art deep learning architecture for
medical segmentation and can segment cardiac structures in real-time with
average errors comparable to inter-observer variability. However, this
architecture still generates large outliers that are often anatomically
incorrect. This work uses the concept of graph convolutional neural networks
that predict the contour points of the structures of interest instead of
labeling each pixel. We propose a graph architecture that uses two
convolutional rings based on cardiac anatomy and show that this eliminates
anatomical incorrect multi-structure segmentations on the publicly available
CAMUS dataset. Additionally, this work contributes with an ablation study on
the graph convolutional architecture and an evaluation of clinical measurements
on the clinical HUNT4 dataset. Finally, we propose to use the inter-model
agreement of the U-Net and the graph network as a predictor of both the input

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has become a popular technique for solving
machine learning (ML) problems when first-order (FO) information is difficult
or impossible to obtain. However, the scalability of ZO optimization remains an
open problem: Its use has primarily been limited to relatively small-scale ML
problems, such as sample-wise adversarial attack generation. To our best
knowledge, no prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of ZO optimization
in training deep neural networks (DNNs) without a significant decrease in
performance. To overcome this roadblock, we develop DeepZero, a principled ZO
deep learning (DL) framework that can scale ZO optimization to DNN training
from scratch through three primary innovations. First, we demonstrate the
advantages of coordinate-wise gradient estimation (CGE) over randomized
vector-wise gradient estimation in training accuracy and computational
efficiency. Second, we propose a sparsity-induced ZO training protocol that
extends the model pruning methodology using only finite differences to explore
and exploit the sparse DL prior in CGE. Third, we develop the methods of
feature reuse and forward parallelization to advance the practical
implementations of ZO training. Our extensive experiments show that DeepZero
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on ResNet-20 trained on CIFAR-10,
approaching FO training performance for the first time. Furthermore, we show
the practical utility of DeepZero in applications of certified adversarial
defense and DL-based partial differential equation error correction, achieving
10-20% improvement over SOTA. We believe our results will inspire future
research on scalable ZO optimization and contribute to advancing DL with black
box.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;De novo drug design requires simultaneously generating novel molecules
outside of training data and predicting their target properties, making it a
hard task for generative models. To address this, we propose Joint Transformer
that combines a Transformer decoder, a Transformer encoder, and a predictor in
a joint generative model with shared weights. We show that training the model
with a penalized log-likelihood objective results in state-of-the-art
performance in molecule generation, while decreasing the prediction error on
newly sampled molecules, as compared to a fine-tuned decoder-only Transformer,
by 42%. Finally, we propose a probabilistic black-box optimization algorithm
that employs Joint Transformer to generate novel molecules with improved target

<title>Sampling via Gradient Flows in the Space of Probability Measures. (arXiv:2310.03597v2 [stat.ML] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03597</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Sampling a target probability distribution with an unknown normalization
constant is a fundamental challenge in computational science and engineering.
Recent work shows that algorithms derived by considering gradient flows in the
space of probability measures open up new avenues for algorithm development.
This paper makes three contributions to this sampling approach by scrutinizing
the design components of such gradient flows. Any instantiation of a gradient
flow for sampling needs an energy functional and a metric to determine the
flow, as well as numerical approximations of the flow to derive algorithms. Our
first contribution is to show that the Kullback-Leibler divergence, as an
energy functional, has the unique property (among all f-divergences) that
gradient flows resulting from it do not depend on the normalization constant of
the target distribution. Our second contribution is to study the choice of
metric from the perspective of invariance. The Fisher-Rao metric is known as
the unique choice (up to scaling) that is diffeomorphism invariant. As a
computationally tractable alternative, we introduce a relaxed, affine
invariance property for the metrics and gradient flows. In particular, we
construct various affine invariant Wasserstein and Stein gradient flows. Affine
invariant gradient flows are shown to behave more favorably than their
non-affine-invariant counterparts when sampling highly anisotropic
distributions, in theory and by using particle methods. Our third contribution
is to study, and develop efficient algorithms based on Gaussian approximations
of the gradient flows; this leads to an alternative to particle methods. We
establish connections between various Gaussian approximate gradient flows,
discuss their relation to gradient methods arising from parametric variational
inference, and study their convergence properties both theoretically and
numerically.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The increasing global emphasis on sustainability and reducing carbon
emissions is pushing governments and corporations to rethink their approach to
data center design and operation. Given their high energy consumption and
exponentially large computational workloads, data centers are prime candidates
for optimizing power consumption, especially in areas such as cooling and IT
energy usage. A significant challenge in this pursuit is the lack of a
configurable and scalable thermal data center model that offers an end-to-end
pipeline. Data centers consist of multiple IT components whose geometric
configuration and heat dissipation make thermal modeling difficult. This paper
presents PyDCM, a customizable Data Center Model implemented in Python, that
allows users to create unique configurations of IT equipment with custom server
specifications and geometric arrangements of IT cabinets. The use of vectorized
thermal calculations makes PyDCM orders of magnitude faster (30 times) than
current Energy Plus modeling implementations and scales sublinearly with the
number of CPUs. Also, PyDCM enables the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning via
the Gymnasium wrapper to optimize data center cooling and offers a
user-friendly platform for testing various data center design prototypes.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Bayesian Optimization (BO), guided by Gaussian process (GP) surrogates, has
proven to be an invaluable technique for efficient, high-dimensional, black-box
optimization, a critical problem inherent to many applications such as
industrial design and scientific computing. Recent contributions have
introduced reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the optimization performance
on both single function optimization and \textit{few-shot} multi-objective
optimization. However, even few-shot techniques fail to exploit similarities
shared between closely related objectives. In this paper, we combine recent
developments in Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) and attention-based Transformer
models to improve the modeling powers of GP surrogates with meta-learning. We
propose a novel method for improving meta-learning BO surrogates by
incorporating attention mechanisms into DKL, empowering the surrogates to adapt
to contextual information gathered during the BO process. We combine this
Transformer Deep Kernel with a learned acquisition function trained with
continuous Soft Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning to aid in exploration. This

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Developing and discovering new drugs is a complex and resource-intensive
endeavor that often involves substantial costs, time investment, and safety
concerns. A key aspect of drug discovery involves identifying novel drug-target
(DT) interactions. Existing computational methods for predicting DT
interactions have primarily focused on binary classification tasks, aiming to
determine whether a DT pair interacts or not. However, protein-ligand
interactions exhibit a continuum of binding strengths, known as binding
affinity, presenting a persistent challenge for accurate prediction. In this
study, we investigate various techniques employed in Drug Target Interaction
(DTI) prediction and propose novel enhancements to enhance their performance.
Our approaches include the integration of Protein Language Models (PLMs) and
the incorporation of Contact Map information as an inductive bias within
current models. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our
proposed approaches outperform the baseline models considered in this study,
presenting a compelling case for further development in this direction. We
anticipate that the insights gained from this work will significantly narrow
the search space for potential drugs targeting specific proteins, thereby
accelerating drug discovery. Code and data for PGraphDTA are available at

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08812</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Time series forecasting represents a significant and challenging task across
various fields. Recently, methods based on mode decomposition have dominated
the forecasting of complex time series because of the advantages of capturing
local characteristics and extracting intrinsic modes from data. Unfortunately,
most models fail to capture the implied volatilities that contain significant
information. To enhance the forecasting of current, rapidly evolving, and
volatile time series, we propose a novel decomposition-ensemble paradigm, the
VMD-LSTM-GARCH model. The Variational Mode Decomposition algorithm is employed
to decompose the time series into K sub-modes. Subsequently, the GARCH model
extracts the volatility information from these sub-modes, which serve as the
input for the LSTM. The numerical and volatility information of each sub-mode
is utilized to train a Long Short-Term Memory network. This network predicts
the sub-mode, and then we aggregate the predictions from all sub-modes to
produce the output. By integrating econometric and artificial intelligence
methods, and taking into account both the numerical and volatility information
of the time series, our proposed model demonstrates superior performance in
time series forecasting, as evidenced by the significant decrease in MSE, RMSE,
and MAPE in our comparative experimental results.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09586</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Most existing methods that address out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization
for node classification on graphs primarily focus on a specific type of data
biases, such as label selection bias or structural bias. However, anticipating
the type of bias in advance is extremely challenging, and designing models
solely for one specific type may not necessarily improve overall generalization
performance. Moreover, limited research has focused on the impact of mixed
biases, which are more prevalent and demanding in real-world scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel Causality and Independence
Enhancement (CIE) framework, applicable to various graph neural networks
(GNNs). Our approach estimates causal and spurious features at the node
representation level and mitigates the influence of spurious correlations
through the backdoor adjustment. Meanwhile, independence constraint is
introduced to improve the discriminability and stability of causal and spurious
features in complex biased environments. Essentially, CIE eliminates different
types of data biases from a unified perspective, without the need to design
separate methods for each bias as before. To evaluate the performance under
specific types of data biases, mixed biases, and low-resource scenarios, we
conducted comprehensive experiments on five publicly available datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach CIE not only significantly
enhances the performance of GNNs but outperforms state-of-the-art debiased node
classification methods.

This study uses technical indicators and features selection and regression

123 technical indicators have been examined on data of the last 13 years of
Apple Company. The results have been investigated by 5 error-based evaluation
criteria. Based on results of the proposed method, MLPSF has 56/47% better
performance than MLP. Also, SVRSF has 67/42% improved compared to SVR. LRSF was
76.7 % improved compared to LR. The RISF method also improved 72.82 % of Ridge
regression. The DTRSB method had 24.23 % improvement over DTR. KNNSB had 15.52
% improvement over KNN regression. RFSB had a 6 % improvement over RF. GBRSF
also improved at 7% over GBR. Finally, ADASF and ADASB also had a 4%
improvement over the ADA regression. Also, Ridge and LinearRegression had the
best results for stock price prediction. Based on results, the best indicators
to predict stock price are: the Squeeze_pro, Percentage Price Oscillator,
Thermo, Decay, Archer On-Balance Volume, Bollinger Bands, Squeeze and Ichimoku

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09971</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We introduce AMAGO, an in-context Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that uses
sequence models to tackle the challenges of generalization, long-term memory,
and meta-learning. Recent works have shown that off-policy learning can make
in-context RL with recurrent policies viable. Nonetheless, these approaches
require extensive tuning and limit scalability by creating key bottlenecks in
agents&apos; memory capacity, planning horizon, and model size. AMAGO revisits and
redesigns the off-policy in-context approach to successfully train
long-sequence Transformers over entire rollouts in parallel with end-to-end RL.
Our agent is uniquely scalable and applicable to a wide range of problems. We
demonstrate its strong performance empirically in meta-RL and long-term memory
domains. AMAGO&apos;s focus on sparse rewards and off-policy data also allows
in-context learning to extend to goal-conditioned problems with challenging
exploration. When combined with a novel hindsight relabeling scheme, AMAGO can
solve a previously difficult category of open-world domains, where agents
complete many possible instructions in procedurally generated environments. We
evaluate our agent on three goal-conditioned domains and study how its
individual improvements connect to create a generalist policy.

<title>Non-parametric Conditional Independence Testing for Mixed Continuous-Categorical Variables: A Novel Method and Numerical Evaluation. (arXiv:2310.11132v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11132</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Conditional independence testing (CIT) is a common task in machine learning,
e.g., for variable selection, and a main component of constraint-based causal
discovery. While most current CIT approaches assume that all variables are
numerical or all variables are categorical, many real-world applications
involve mixed-type datasets that include numerical and categorical variables.
Non-parametric CIT can be conducted using conditional mutual information (CMI)
estimators combined with a local permutation scheme. Recently, two novel CMI
estimators for mixed-type datasets based on k-nearest-neighbors (k-NN) have
been proposed. As with any k-NN method, these estimators rely on the definition
of a distance metric. One approach computes distances by a one-hot encoding of
the categorical variables, essentially treating categorical variables as
discrete-numerical, while the other expresses CMI by entropy terms where the
categorical variables appear as conditions only. In this work, we study these
estimators and propose a variation of the former approach that does not treat
categorical variables as numeric. Our numerical experiments show that our
variant detects dependencies more robustly across different data distributions
and preprocessing types.

<title>VQ-NeRF: Neural Reflectance Decomposition and Editing with Vector Quantization. (arXiv:2310.11864v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11864</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;We propose VQ-NeRF, a two-branch neural network model that incorporates
Vector Quantization (VQ) to decompose and edit reflectance fields in 3D scenes.
Conventional neural reflectance fields use only continuous representations to
model 3D scenes, despite the fact that objects are typically composed of
discrete materials in reality. This lack of discretization can result in noisy
material decomposition and complicated material editing. To address these
limitations, our model consists of a continuous branch and a discrete branch.
The continuous branch follows the conventional pipeline to predict decomposed
materials, while the discrete branch uses the VQ mechanism to quantize
continuous materials into individual ones. By discretizing the materials, our
model can reduce noise in the decomposition process and generate a segmentation
map of discrete materials. Specific materials can be easily selected for
further editing by clicking on the corresponding area of the segmentation
outcomes. Additionally, we propose a dropout-based VQ codeword ranking strategy
to predict the number of materials in a scene, which reduces redundancy in the
material segmentation process. To improve usability, we also develop an
interactive interface to further assist material editing. We evaluate our model
on both computer-generated and real-world scenes, demonstrating its superior
performance. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first to enable
discrete material editing in 3D scenes.

<title>SalUn: Empowering Machine Unlearning via Gradient-based Weight Saliency in Both Image Classification and Generation. (arXiv:2310.12508v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12508</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;With evolving data regulations, machine unlearning (MU) has become an
important tool for fostering trust and safety in today&apos;s AI models. However,
existing MU methods focusing on data and/or weight perspectives often grapple
with limitations in unlearning accuracy, stability, and cross-domain
applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of &apos;weight
saliency&apos; in MU, drawing parallels with input saliency in model explanation.
This innovation directs MU&apos;s attention toward specific model weights rather
than the entire model, improving effectiveness and efficiency. The resultant
method that we call saliency unlearning (SalUn) narrows the performance gap
with &apos;exact&apos; unlearning (model retraining from scratch after removing the
forgetting dataset). To the best of our knowledge, SalUn is the first
principled MU approach adaptable enough to effectively erase the influence of
forgetting data, classes, or concepts in both image classification and
generation. For example, SalUn yields a stability advantage in high-variance
random data forgetting, e.g., with a 0.2% gap compared to exact unlearning on
the CIFAR-10 dataset. Moreover, in preventing conditional diffusion models from
generating harmful images, SalUn achieves nearly 100% unlearning accuracy,
outperforming current state-of-the-art baselines like Erased Stable Diffusion
and Forget-Me-Not.

<title>Contrast Everything: A Hierarchical Contrastive Framework for Medical Time-Series. (arXiv:2310.14017v4 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14017</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Contrastive representation learning is crucial in medical time series
analysis as it alleviates dependency on labor-intensive, domain-specific, and
scarce expert annotations. However, existing contrastive learning methods
primarily focus on one single data level, which fails to fully exploit the
intricate nature of medical time series. To address this issue, we present
COMET, an innovative hierarchical framework that leverages data consistencies
at all inherent levels in medical time series. Our meticulously designed model
systematically captures data consistency from four potential levels:
observation, sample, trial, and patient levels. By developing contrastive loss
at multiple levels, we can learn effective representations that preserve
comprehensive data consistency, maximizing information utilization in a
self-supervised manner. We conduct experiments in the challenging
patient-independent setting. We compare COMET against six baselines using three
diverse datasets, which include ECG signals for myocardial infarction and EEG
signals for Alzheimer&apos;s and Parkinson&apos;s diseases. The results demonstrate that
COMET consistently outperforms all baselines, particularly in setup with 10%
and 1% labeled data fractions across all datasets. These results underscore the
significant impact of our framework in advancing contrastive representation
learning techniques for medical time series. The source code is available at

<title>Domain Watermark: Effective and Harmless Dataset Copyright Protection is Closed at Hand. (arXiv:2310.14942v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14942</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The prosperity of deep neural networks (DNNs) is largely benefited from
open-source datasets, based on which users can evaluate and improve their
methods. In this paper, we revisit backdoor-based dataset ownership
verification (DOV), which is currently the only feasible approach to protect
the copyright of open-source datasets. We reveal that these methods are
fundamentally harmful given that they could introduce malicious
misclassification behaviors to watermarked DNNs by the adversaries. In this
paper, we design DOV from another perspective by making watermarked models
(trained on the protected dataset) correctly classify some `hard&apos; samples that
will be misclassified by the benign model. Our method is inspired by the
generalization property of DNNs, where we find a \emph{hardly-generalized
domain} for the original dataset (as its \emph{domain watermark}). It can be
easily learned with the protected dataset containing modified samples.
Specifically, we formulate the domain generation as a bi-level optimization and
propose to optimize a set of visually-indistinguishable clean-label modified
data with similar effects to domain-watermarked samples from the
hardly-generalized domain to ensure watermark stealthiness. We also design a
hypothesis-test-guided ownership verification via our domain watermark and
provide the theoretical analyses of our method. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets are conducted, which verify the effectiveness of our method
and its resistance to potential adaptive methods. The code for reproducing main
experiments is available at

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The race to train language models on vast, diverse, and inconsistently
documented datasets has raised pressing concerns about the legal and ethical

datasets, from their source, creators, series of license conditions,
properties, and subsequent use. Our landscape analysis highlights the sharp
divides in composition and focus of commercially open vs closed datasets, with
closed datasets monopolizing important categories: lower resource languages,
more creative tasks, richer topic variety, newer and more synthetic training
data. This points to a deepening divide in the types of data that are made

jurisdictional legal interpretations of copyright and fair use. We also observe
frequent miscategorization of licenses on widely used dataset hosting sites,
with license omission of 70%+ and error rates of 50%+. This points to a crisis
in misattribution and informed use of the most popular datasets driving many

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) are prevalent on the web and research over TAGs
such as citation networks, e-commerce networks and social networks has
attracted considerable attention in the web community. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across a wide range of
tasks. However, the existing works focus on harnessing the potential of LLMs
solely relying on prompts to convey graph structure information to LLMs, thus
suffering from insufficient understanding of the complex structural
relationships within TAGs. To address this problem, in this paper we present
the Disentangled Graph-Text Learner (DGTL) model, which is able to enhance the
reasoning and predicting capabilities of LLMs for TAGs. Our proposed DGTL model
incorporates graph structure information through tailored disentangled graph
neural network (GNN) layers, enabling LLMs to capture the intricate
relationships hidden in text-attributed graphs from multiple structural
factors. Furthermore, DGTL operates with frozen pre-trained LLMs, reducing
computational costs and allowing much more flexibility in combining with
different LLM models. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed DGTL model on achieving superior or comparable performance over
state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, we also demonstrate that our DGTL
model can offer natural language explanations for predictions, thereby
significantly enhancing model interpretability.

<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Existing deep-learning approaches to semantic column type annotation (CTA)
have important shortcomings: they rely on semantic types which are fixed at

evaluated on novel datasets, even when types remain constant. Large language
models have exhibited strong zero-shot classification performance on a wide

ArcheType, a simple, practical method for context sampling, prompt
serialization, model querying, and label remapping, which enables large
language models to solve CTA problems in a fully zero-shot manner. We ablate
each component of our method separately, and establish that improvements to
context sampling and label remapping provide the most consistent gains.
ArcheType establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot CTA
benchmarks (including three new domain-specific benchmarks which we release
along with this paper), and when used in conjunction with classical CTA
techniques, it outperforms a SOTA DoDuo model on the fine-tuned SOTAB

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18919</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Recent studies in reinforcement learning (RL) have made significant progress
by leveraging function approximation to alleviate the sample complexity hurdle
for better performance. Despite the success, existing provably efficient
algorithms typically rely on the accessibility of immediate feedback upon
taking actions. The failure to account for the impact of delay in observations
can significantly degrade the performance of real-world systems due to the
regret blow-up. In this work, we tackle the challenge of delayed feedback in RL
with linear function approximation by employing posterior sampling, which has
been shown to empirically outperform the popular UCB algorithms in a wide range
of regimes. We first introduce Delayed-PSVI, an optimistic value-based
algorithm that effectively explores the value function space via noise
perturbation with posterior sampling. We provide the first analysis for
posterior sampling algorithms with delayed feedback in RL and show our
algorithm achieves $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d^3H^3 T} + d^2H^2 E[\tau])$ worst-case
regret in the presence of unknown stochastic delays. Here $E[\tau]$ is the
expected delay. To further improve its computational efficiency and to expand
its applicability in high-dimensional RL problems, we incorporate a
gradient-based approximate sampling scheme via Langevin dynamics for
Delayed-LPSVI, which maintains the same order-optimal regret guarantee with
$\widetilde{O}(dHK)$ computational cost. Empirical evaluations are performed to
demonstrate the statistical and computational efficacy of our algorithms.

inherent limitations of traditional supervised recognition models that are
restricted by a predefined category set. While strides have been made in the
realms of self-supervised and open-world learning towards test-time category
discovery, a crucial yet often overlooked question persists: what exactly
delineates a category? In this paper, we conceptualize a category through the
lens of optimization, viewing it as an optimal solution to a well-defined
problem. Harnessing this unique conceptualization, we propose a novel,
efficient and self-supervised method capable of discovering previously unknown
categories at test time. A salient feature of our approach is the assignment of
minimum length category codes to individual data instances, which encapsulates
the implicit category hierarchy prevalent in real-world datasets. This
mechanism affords us enhanced control over category granularity, thereby
equipping our model to handle fine-grained categories adeptly. Experimental
evaluations, bolstered by state-of-the-art benchmark comparisons, testify to
the efficacy of our solution in managing unknown categories at test time.
Furthermore, we fortify our proposition with a theoretical foundation,
providing proof of its optimality. Our code is available at

<title>Early detection of inflammatory arthritis to improve referrals using multimodal machine learning from blood testing, semi-structured and unstructured patient records. (arXiv:2310.19967v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19967</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Early detection of inflammatory arthritis (IA) is critical to efficient and
accurate hospital referral triage for timely treatment and preventing the
deterioration of the IA disease course, especially under limited healthcare
resources. The manual assessment process is the most common approach in
practice for the early detection of IA, but it is extremely labor-intensive and
inefficient. A large amount of clinical information needs to be assessed for
every referral from General Practice (GP) to the hospitals. Machine learning
shows great potential in automating repetitive assessment tasks and providing
decision support for the early detection of IA. However, most machine
learning-based methods for IA detection rely on blood testing results. But in
practice, blood testing data is not always available at the point of referrals,
so we need methods to leverage multimodal data such as semi-structured and
unstructured data for early detection of IA. In this research, we present
fusion and ensemble learning-based methods using multimodal data to assist
decision-making in the early detection of IA, and a conformal prediction-based
method to quantify the uncertainty of the prediction and detect any unreliable
predictions. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first attempt to
utilize multimodal data to support the early detection of IA from GP referrals.

<title>Efficient Robust Bayesian Optimization for Arbitrary Uncertain Inputs. (arXiv:2310.20145v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20145</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a sample-efficient optimization algorithm
widely employed across various applications. In some challenging BO tasks,
input uncertainty arises due to the inevitable randomness in the optimization
process, such as machining errors, execution noise, or contextual variability.
This uncertainty deviates the input from the intended value before evaluation,
resulting in significant performance fluctuations in the final result. In this
paper, we introduce a novel robust Bayesian Optimization algorithm, AIRBO,
which can effectively identify a robust optimum that performs consistently well
under arbitrary input uncertainty. Our method directly models the uncertain
inputs of arbitrary distributions by empowering the Gaussian Process with the
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and further accelerates the posterior inference
via Nystrom approximation. Rigorous theoretical regret bound is established
under MMD estimation error and extensive experiments on synthetic functions and
real problems demonstrate that our approach can handle various input
uncertainties and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

<title>Unleashing the Power of Pre-trained Language Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning. (arXiv:2310.20587v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20587</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find a near-optimal policy using
pre-collected datasets. In real-world scenarios, data collection could be
costly and risky; therefore, offline RL becomes particularly challenging when
the in-domain data is limited. Given recent advances in Large Language Models
(LLMs) and their few-shot learning prowess, this paper introduces
$\textbf{La}$nguage Models for $\textbf{Mo}$tion Control ($\textbf{LaMo}$), a
general framework based on Decision Transformers to effectively use pre-trained
Language Models (LMs) for offline RL. Our framework highlights four crucial
components: (1) Initializing Decision Transformers with sequentially
pre-trained LMs, (2) employing the LoRA fine-tuning method, in contrast to
full-weight fine-tuning, to combine the pre-trained knowledge from LMs and
in-domain knowledge effectively, (3) using the non-linear MLP transformation
instead of linear projections, to generate embeddings, and (4) integrating an
auxiliary language prediction loss during fine-tuning to stabilize the LMs and
retain their original abilities on languages. Empirical results indicate
$\textbf{LaMo}$ achieves state-of-the-art performance in sparse-reward tasks
and closes the gap between value-based offline RL methods and decision
transformers in dense-reward tasks. In particular, our method demonstrates
superior performance in scenarios with limited data samples. Our project

<title>Crop Disease Classification using Support Vector Machines with Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC) and Attention based feature extraction for IoT based Smart Agricultural Applications. (arXiv:2311.00429v2 [eess.IV] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00429</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Crops hold paramount significance as they serve as the primary provider of
energy, nutrition, and medicinal benefits for the human population. Plant
diseases, however, can negatively affect leaves during agricultural
cultivation, resulting in significant losses in crop output and economic value.
Therefore, it is crucial for farmers to identify crop diseases. However, this
method frequently necessitates hard work, a lot of planning, and in-depth
familiarity with plant pathogens. Given these numerous obstacles, it is
essential to provide solutions that can easily interface with mobile and IoT
devices so that our farmers can guarantee the best possible crop development.
Various machine learning (ML) as well as deep learning (DL) algorithms have
been created &amp;amp; studied for the identification of plant disease detection,
yielding substantial and promising results. This article presents a novel
classification method that builds on prior work by utilising attention-based
feature extraction, RGB channel-based chromatic analysis, Support Vector
Machines (SVM) for improved performance, and the ability to integrate with
mobile applications and IoT devices after quantization of information. Several
disease classification algorithms were compared with the suggested model, and
it was discovered that, in terms of accuracy, Vision Transformer-based feature
extraction and additional Green Chromatic Coordinate feature with SVM
classification achieved an accuracy of (GCCViT-SVM) - 99.69%, whereas after
quantization for IoT device integration achieved an accuracy of - 97.41% while
almost reducing 4x in size. Our findings have profound implications because
they have the potential to transform how farmers identify crop illnesses with
precise and fast information, thereby preserving agricultural output and
ensuring food security.

<title>TRIALSCOPE: A Unifying Causal Framework for Scaling Real-World Evidence Generation with Biomedical Language Models. (arXiv:2311.01301v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01301</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The rapid digitization of real-world data offers an unprecedented opportunity
for optimizing healthcare delivery and accelerating biomedical discovery. In
practice, however, such data is most abundantly available in unstructured
forms, such as clinical notes in electronic medical records (EMRs), and it is
generally plagued by confounders. In this paper, we present TRIALSCOPE, a
unifying framework for distilling real-world evidence from population-level
observational data. TRIALSCOPE leverages biomedical language models to
structure clinical text at scale, employs advanced probabilistic modeling for
denoising and imputation, and incorporates state-of-the-art causal inference
techniques to combat common confounders. Using clinical trial specification as
generic representation, TRIALSCOPE provides a turn-key solution to generate and
reason with clinical hypotheses using observational data. In extensive
experiments and analyses on a large-scale real-world dataset with over one
million cancer patients from a large US healthcare network, we show that
TRIALSCOPE can produce high-quality structuring of real-world data and
generates comparable results to marquee cancer trials. In addition to
facilitating in-silicon clinical trial design and optimization, TRIALSCOPE may
be used to empower synthetic controls, pragmatic trials, post-market
surveillance, as well as support fine-grained patient-like-me reasoning in
precision diagnosis and treatment.

<title>Vision-Language Foundation Models as Effective Robot Imitators. (arXiv:2311.01378v2 [cs.RO] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01378</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;Recent progress in vision language foundation models has shown their ability
to understand multimodal data and resolve complicated vision language tasks,
including robotics manipulation. We seek a straightforward way of making use of
existing vision-language models (VLMs) with simple fine-tuning on robotics
data. To this end, we derive a simple and novel vision-language manipulation
framework, dubbed RoboFlamingo, built upon the open-source VLMs, OpenFlamingo.
Unlike prior works, RoboFlamingo utilizes pre-trained VLMs for single-step
vision-language comprehension, models sequential history information with an
explicit policy head, and is slightly fine-tuned by imitation learning only on
language-conditioned manipulation datasets. Such a decomposition provides
RoboFlamingo the flexibility for open-loop control and deployment on
low-performance platforms. By exceeding the state-of-the-art performance with a
large margin on the tested benchmark, we show RoboFlamingo can be an effective
and competitive alternative to adapt VLMs to robot control. Our extensive
experimental results also reveal several interesting conclusions regarding the
behavior of different pre-trained VLMs on manipulation tasks. We believe
RoboFlamingo has the potential to be a cost-effective and easy-to-use solution
for robotics manipulation, empowering everyone with the ability to fine-tune
their own robotics policy.

<title>CDGraph: Dual Conditional Social Graph Synthesizing via Diffusion Model. (arXiv:2311.01729v2 [cs.SI] UPDATED)</title>
<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01729</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;The social graphs synthesized by the generative models are increasingly in
demand due to data scarcity and concerns over user privacy. One of the key
performance criteria for generating social networks is the fidelity to
specified conditionals, such as users with certain membership and financial
status. While recent diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in
generating images, their effectiveness in synthesizing graphs has not yet been
explored in the context of conditional social graphs. In this paper, we propose
the first kind of conditional diffusion model for social networks, CDGraph,
which trains and synthesizes graphs based on two specified conditions. We
propose the co-evolution dependency in the denoising process of CDGraph to
capture the mutual dependencies between the dual conditions and further
incorporate social homophily and social contagion to preserve the connectivity
between nodes while satisfying the specified conditions. Moreover, we introduce
a novel classifier loss, which guides the training of the diffusion process
through the mutual dependency of dual conditions. We evaluate CDGraph against
four existing graph generative methods, i.e., SPECTRE, GSM, EDGE, and DiGress,
on four datasets. Our results show that the generated graphs from CDGraph
achieve much higher dual-conditional validity and lower discrepancy in various
social network metrics than the baselines, thus demonstrating its proficiency
in generating dual-conditional social graphs.

<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00955</link>
<description rdf:parseType="Literal">&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we investigate federated clustering (FedC) problem, that aims
to accurately partition unlabeled data samples distributed over massive clients
into finite clusters under the orchestration of a parameter server, meanwhile
considering data privacy. Though it is an NP-hard optimization problem
involving real variables denoting cluster centroids and binary variables
denoting the cluster membership of each data sample, we judiciously reformulate
the FedC problem into a non-convex optimization problem with only one convex
constraint, accordingly yielding a soft clustering solution. Then a novel FedC
algorithm using differential privacy (DP) technique, referred to as DP-FedC, is
proposed in which partial clients participation and multiple local model
updating steps are also considered. Furthermore, various attributes of the
proposed DP-FedC are obtained through theoretical analyses of privacy
protection and convergence rate, especially for the case of non-identically and
independently distributed (non-i.i.d.) data, that ideally serve as the
guidelines for the design of the proposed DP-FedC. Then some experimental
results on two real datasets are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed DP-FedC together with its much superior performance over some
state-of-the-art FedC algorithms, and the consistency with all the presented
