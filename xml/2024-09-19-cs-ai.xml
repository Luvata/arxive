      <title>SAM4MLLM: Enhance Multi-Modal Large Language Model for Referring Expression Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SAM4MLLM, an innovative approach which integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for pixel-aware tasks. Our method enables MLLMs to learn pixel-level location information without requiring excessive modifications to the existing model architecture or adding specialized tokens. We introduce an inquiry-based approach that can effectively find prompt points for SAM to perform segmentation based on MLLM. It combines detailed visual information with the powerful expressive capabilities of large language models in a unified language-based manner without additional computational overhead in learning. Experimental results on pubic benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Logic Synthesis Optimization with Predictive Self-Supervision via Causal Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary hardware design benefits from the abstraction provided by high-level logic gates, streamlining the implementation of logic circuits. Logic Synthesis Optimization (LSO) operates at one level of abstraction within the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) workflow, targeting improvements in logic circuits with respect to performance metrics such as size and speed in the final layout. Recent trends in the field show a growing interest in leveraging Machine Learning (ML) for EDA, notably through ML-guided logic synthesis utilizing policy-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods.Despite these advancements, existing models face challenges such as overfitting and limited generalization, attributed to constrained public circuits and the expressiveness limitations of graph encoders. To address these hurdles, and tackle data scarcity issues, we introduce LSOformer, a novel approach harnessing Autoregressive transformer models and predictive SSL to predict the trajectory of Quality of Results (QoR). LSOformer integrates cross-attention modules to merge insights from circuit graphs and optimization sequences, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy for QoR metrics. Experimental studies validate the effectiveness of LSOformer, showcasing its superior performance over baseline architectures in QoR prediction tasks, where it achieves improvements of 5.74%, 4.35%, and 17.06% on the EPFL, OABCD, and proprietary circuits datasets, respectively, in inductive setup.</description>

      <title>Gradient-free Post-hoc Explainability Using Distillation Aided Learnable Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), with the release of several large models having only query access, make a strong case for explainability of deep models in a post-hoc gradient free manner. In this paper, we propose a framework, named distillation aided explainability (DAX), that attempts to generate a saliency-based explanation in a model agnostic gradient free application. The DAX approach poses the problem of explanation in a learnable setting with a mask generation network and a distillation network. The mask generation network learns to generate the multiplier mask that finds the salient regions of the input, while the student distillation network aims to approximate the local behavior of the black-box model. We propose a joint optimization of the two networks in the DAX framework using the locally perturbed input samples, with the targets derived from input-output access to the black-box model. We extensively evaluate DAX across different modalities (image and audio), in a classification setting, using a diverse set of evaluations (intersection over union with ground truth, deletion based and subjective human evaluation based measures) and benchmark it with respect to $9$ different methods. In these evaluations, the DAX significantly outperforms the existing approaches on all modalities and evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning and Theory Ladenness -- A Phenomenological Account</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the dissemination of machine learning (ML) methodologies in scientific research has prompted discussions on theory ladenness. More specifically, the issue of theory ladenness has remerged as questions about whether and how ML models (MLMs) and ML modelling strategies are impacted by the domain theory of the scientific field in which ML is used and implemented (e.g., physics, chemistry, biology, etc). On the one hand, some have argued that there is no difference between traditional (pre ML) and ML assisted science. In both cases, theory plays an essential and unavoidable role in the analysis of phenomena and the construction and use of models. Others have argued instead that ML methodologies and models are theory independent and, in some cases, even theory free. In this article, we argue that both positions are overly simplistic and do not advance our understanding of the interplay between ML methods and domain theories. Specifically, we provide an analysis of theory ladenness in ML assisted science. Our analysis reveals that, while the construction of MLMs can be relatively independent of domain theory, the practical implementation and interpretation of these models within a given specific domain still relies on fundamental theoretical assumptions and background knowledge.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks for Vehicle Routing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vehicle Routing Problem is about optimizing the routes of vehicles to meet the needs of customers at specific locations. The route graph consists of depots on several levels and customer positions. Several optimization methods have been developed over the years, most of which are based on some type of classic heuristic: genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, tabu search, ant colony optimization, firefly algorithm. Recent developments in machine learning provide a new toolset, the rich family of neural networks, for tackling complex problems. The main area of application of neural networks is the area of classification and regression. Route optimization can be viewed as a new challenge for neural networks. The article first presents an analysis of the applicability of neural network tools, then a novel graphical neural network model is presented in detail. The efficiency analysis based on test experiments shows the applicability of the proposed NN architecture.</description>

      <title>Navigating Process Mining: A Case study using pm4py</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process-mining techniques have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing event data to gain insights into business processes. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of road traffic fine management processes using the pm4py library in Python. We start by importing an event log dataset and explore its characteristics, including the distribution of activities and process variants. Through filtering and statistical analysis, we uncover key patterns and variations in the process executions. Subsequently, we apply various process-mining algorithms, including the Alpha Miner, Inductive Miner, and Heuristic Miner, to discover process models from the event log data. We visualize the discovered models to understand the workflow structures and dependencies within the process. Additionally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of each mining approach in capturing the underlying process dynamics. Our findings shed light on the efficiency and effectiveness of road traffic fine management processes, providing valuable insights for process optimization and decision-making. This study demonstrates the utility of pm4py in facilitating process mining tasks and its potential for analyzing real-world business processes.</description>

      <title>Audio Transformers:Transformer Architectures For Large Scale Audio Understanding. Adieu Convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.00335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, CNN architectures have produced compelling models of sound perception and cognition, learning hierarchical organizations of features. Analogous to successes in computer vision, audio feature classification can be optimized for a particular task of interest, over a wide variety of datasets and labels. In fact similar architectures designed for image understanding have proven effective for acoustic scene analysis. Here we propose applying Transformer based architectures without convolutional layers to raw audio signals. On a standard dataset of Free Sound 50K,comprising of 200 categories, our model outperforms convolutional models to produce state of the art results. This is significant as unlike in natural language processing and computer vision, we do not perform unsupervised pre-training for outperforming convolutional architectures. On the same training set, with respect mean aver-age precision benchmarks, we show a significant improvement. We further improve the performance of Transformer architectures by using techniques such as pooling inspired from convolutional net-work designed in the past few years. In addition, we also show how multi-rate signal processing ideas inspired from wavelets, can be applied to the Transformer embeddings to improve the results. We also show how our models learns a non-linear non constant band-width filter-bank, which shows an adaptable time frequency front end representation for the task of audio understanding, different from other tasks e.g. pitch estimation.</description>

      <title>Diverse Neural Audio Embeddings -- Bringing Features back !</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08751v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of modern AI architectures, a shift has happened towards end-to-end architectures. This pivot has led to neural architectures being trained without domain-specific biases/knowledge, optimized according to the task. We in this paper, learn audio embeddings via diverse feature representations, in this case, domain-specific. For the case of audio classification over hundreds of categories of sound, we learn robust separate embeddings for diverse audio properties such as pitch, timbre, and neural representation, along with also learning it via an end-to-end architecture. We observe handcrafted embeddings, e.g., pitch and timbre-based, although on their own, are not able to beat a fully end-to-end representation, yet adding these together with end-to-end embedding helps us, significantly improve performance. This work would pave the way to bring some domain expertise with end-to-end models to learn robust, diverse representations, surpassing the performance of just training end-to-end models.</description>

      <title>Deception Detection from Linguistic and Physiological Data Streams Using Bimodal Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10944v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deception detection is gaining increasing interest due to ethical and security concerns. This paper explores the application of convolutional neural networks for the purpose of multimodal deception detection. We use a dataset built by interviewing 104 subjects about two topics, with one truthful and one falsified response from each subject about each topic. In particular, we make three main contributions. First, we extract linguistic and physiological features from this data to train and construct the neural network models. Second, we propose a fused convolutional neural network model using both modalities in order to achieve an improved overall performance. Third, we compare our new approach with earlier methods designed for multimodal deception detection. We find that our system outperforms regular classification methods; our results indicate the feasibility of using neural networks for deception detection even in the presence of limited amounts of data.</description>

      <title>ASMA: An Adaptive Safety Margin Algorithm for Vision-Language Drone Navigation via Scene-Aware Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of vision-language navigation (VLN), ensuring robust safety mechanisms remains an open challenge. Control barrier functions (CBFs) are efficient tools which guarantee safety by solving an optimal control problem. In this work, we consider the case of a teleoperated drone in a VLN setting, and add safety features by formulating a novel scene-aware CBF using ego-centric observations obtained through an RGB-D sensor. As a baseline, we implement a vision-language understanding module which uses the contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) model to query about a user-specified (in natural language) landmark. Using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detector, the CLIP model is queried for verifying the cropped landmark, triggering downstream navigation. To improve navigation safety of the baseline, we propose ASMA -- an Adaptive Safety Margin Algorithm -- that crops the drone's depth map for tracking moving object(s) to perform scene-aware CBF evaluation on-the-fly. By identifying potential risky observations from the scene, ASMA enables real-time adaptation to unpredictable environmental conditions, ensuring optimal safety bounds on a VLN-powered drone actions. Using the robot operating system (ROS) middleware on a parrot bebop2 quadrotor in the gazebo environment, ASMA offers 59.4% - 61.8% increase in success rates with insignificant 5.4% - 8.2% increases in trajectory lengths compared to the baseline CBF-less VLN while recovering from unsafe situations.</description>

      <title>Achieving Responsible AI through ESG: Insights and Recommendations from Industry Engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes integral to business operations, integrating Responsible AI (RAI) within Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) frameworks is essential for ethical and sustainable AI deployment. This study examines how leading companies align RAI with their ESG goals. Through interviews with 28 industry leaders, we identified a strong link between RAI and ESG practices. However, a significant gap exists between internal RAI policies and public disclosures, highlighting the need for greater board-level expertise, robust governance, and employee engagement. We provide key recommendations to strengthen RAI strategies, focusing on transparency, cross-functional collaboration, and seamless integration into existing ESG frameworks.</description>

      <title>LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks for Cybersecurity Named Entity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The automated and timely conversion of cybersecurity information from unstructured online sources, such as blogs and articles to more formal representations has become a necessity for many applications in the domain nowadays. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is one of the early phases towards this goal. It involves the detection of the relevant domain entities, such as product, version, attack name, etc. in technical documents. Although generally considered a simple task in the information extraction field, it is quite challenging in some domains like cybersecurity because of the complex structure of its entities. The state of the art methods require time-consuming and labor intensive feature engineering that describes the properties of the entities, their context, domain knowledge, and linguistic characteristics. The model demonstrated in this paper is domain independent and does not rely on any features specific to the entities in the cybersecurity domain, hence does not require expert knowledge to perform feature engineering. The method used relies on a type of recurrent neural networks called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and the Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) method. The results we obtained showed that this method outperforms the state of the art methods given an annotated corpus of a decent size.</description>

      <title>Bridging User Dynamics: Transforming Sequential Recommendations with Schr\"odinger Bridge and Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation has attracted increasing attention due to its ability to accurately capture the dynamic changes in user interests. We have noticed that generative models, especially diffusion models, which have achieved significant results in fields like image and audio, hold considerable promise in the field of sequential recommendation. However, existing sequential recommendation methods based on diffusion models are constrained by a prior distribution limited to Gaussian distribution, hindering the possibility of introducing user-specific information for each recommendation and leading to information loss. To address these issues, we introduce the Schr\"odinger Bridge into diffusion-based sequential recommendation models, creating the SdifRec model. This allows us to replace the Gaussian prior of the diffusion model with the user's current state, directly modeling the process from a user's current state to the target recommendation. Additionally, to better utilize collaborative information in recommendations, we propose an extended version of SdifRec called con-SdifRec, which utilizes user clustering information as a guiding condition to further enhance the posterior distribution. Finally, extensive experiments on multiple public benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of SdifRec and con-SdifRec through comparison with several state-of-the-art methods. Further in-depth analysis has validated their efficiency and robustness.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Artificial Intelligence for Wildlife Conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid decline in global biodiversity demands innovative conservation strategies. This paper examines the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in wildlife conservation, focusing on the Conservation AI platform. Leveraging machine learning and computer vision, Conservation AI detects and classifies animals, humans, and poaching-related objects using visual spectrum and thermal infrared cameras. The platform processes this data with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer architectures to monitor species, including those which are critically endangered. Real-time detection provides the immediate responses required for time-critical situations (e.g. poaching), while non-real-time analysis supports long-term wildlife monitoring and habitat health assessment. Case studies from Europe, North America, Africa, and Southeast Asia highlight the platform's success in species identification, biodiversity monitoring, and poaching prevention. The paper also discusses challenges related to data quality, model accuracy, and logistical constraints, while outlining future directions involving technological advancements, expansion into new geographical regions, and deeper collaboration with local communities and policymakers. Conservation AI represents a significant step forward in addressing the urgent challenges of wildlife conservation, offering a scalable and adaptable solution that can be implemented globally.</description>

      <title>3CSim: CARLA Corner Case Simulation for Control Assessment in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the CARLA corner case simulation (3CSim) for evaluating autonomous driving (AD) systems within the CARLA simulator. This framework is designed to address the limitations of traditional AD model training by focusing on non-standard, rare, and cognitively challenging scenarios. These corner cases are crucial for ensuring vehicle safety and reliability, as they test advanced control capabilities under unusual conditions. Our approach introduces a taxonomy of corner cases categorized into state anomalies, behavior anomalies, and evidence-based anomalies. We implement 32 unique corner cases with adjustable parameters, including 9 predefined weather conditions, timing, and traffic density. The framework enables repeatable and modifiable scenario evaluations, facilitating the creation of a comprehensive dataset for further analysis.</description>

      <title>"Is This It?": Towards Ecologically Valid Benchmarks for Situated Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report initial work towards constructing ecologically valid benchmarks to assess the capabilities of large multimodal models for engaging in situated collaboration. In contrast to existing benchmarks, in which question-answer pairs are generated post hoc over preexisting or synthetic datasets via templates, human annotators, or large language models (LLMs), we propose and investigate an interactive system-driven approach, where the questions are generated by users in context, during their interactions with an end-to-end situated AI system. We illustrate how the questions that arise are different in form and content from questions typically found in existing embodied question answering (EQA) benchmarks and discuss new real-world challenge problems brought to the fore.</description>

      <title>Effective Monitoring of Online Decision-Making Algorithms in Digital Intervention Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online AI decision-making algorithms are increasingly used by digital interventions to dynamically personalize treatment to individuals. These algorithms determine, in real-time, the delivery of treatment based on accruing data. The objective of this paper is to provide guidelines for enabling effective monitoring of online decision-making algorithms with the goal of (1) safeguarding individuals and (2) ensuring data quality. We elucidate guidelines and discuss our experience in monitoring online decision-making algorithms in two digital intervention clinical trials (Oralytics and MiWaves). Our guidelines include (1) developing fallback methods, pre-specified procedures executed when an issue occurs, and (2) identifying potential issues categorizing them by severity (red, yellow, and green). Across both trials, the monitoring systems detected real-time issues such as out-of-memory issues, database timeout, and failed communication with an external source. Fallback methods prevented participants from not receiving any treatment during the trial and also prevented the use of incorrect data in statistical analyses. These trials provide case studies for how health scientists can build monitoring systems for their digital intervention. Without these algorithm monitoring systems, critical issues would have gone undetected and unresolved. Instead, these monitoring systems safeguarded participants and ensured the quality of the resulting data for updating the intervention and facilitating scientific discovery. These monitoring guidelines and findings give digital intervention teams the confidence to include online decision-making algorithms in digital interventions.</description>

      <title>Towards Empathetic Conversational Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) are able to elicit user preferences through multi-turn dialogues. They typically incorporate external knowledge and pre-trained language models to capture the dialogue context. Most CRS approaches, trained on benchmark datasets, assume that the standard items and responses in these benchmarks are optimal. However, they overlook that users may express negative emotions with the standard items and may not feel emotionally engaged by the standard responses. This issue leads to a tendency to replicate the logic of recommenders in the dataset instead of aligning with user needs. To remedy this misalignment, we introduce empathy within a CRS. With empathy we refer to a system's ability to capture and express emotions. We propose an empathetic conversational recommender (ECR) framework.
  ECR contains two main modules: emotion-aware item recommendation and emotion-aligned response generation. Specifically, we employ user emotions to refine user preference modeling for accurate recommendations. To generate human-like emotional responses, ECR applies retrieval-augmented prompts to fine-tune a pre-trained language model aligning with emotions and mitigating hallucination. To address the challenge of insufficient supervision labels, we enlarge our empathetic data using emotion labels annotated by large language models and emotional reviews collected from external resources. We propose novel evaluation metrics to capture user satisfaction in real-world CRS scenarios. Our experiments on the ReDial dataset validate the efficacy of our framework in enhancing recommendation accuracy and improving user satisfaction.</description>

      <title>From Latent to Engine Manifolds: Analyzing ImageBind's Multimodal Embedding Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates ImageBind's ability to generate meaningful fused multimodal embeddings for online auto parts listings. We propose a simplistic embedding fusion workflow that aims to capture the overlapping information of image/text pairs, ultimately combining the semantics of a post into a joint embedding. After storing such fused embeddings in a vector database, we experiment with dimensionality reduction and provide empirical evidence to convey the semantic quality of the joint embeddings by clustering and examining the posts nearest to each cluster centroid. Additionally, our initial findings with ImageBind's emergent zero-shot cross-modal retrieval suggest that pure audio embeddings can correlate with semantically similar marketplace listings, indicating potential avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Learning Co-Speech Gesture Representations in Dialogue through Contrastive Learning: An Intrinsic Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In face-to-face dialogues, the form-meaning relationship of co-speech gestures varies depending on contextual factors such as what the gestures refer to and the individual characteristics of speakers. These factors make co-speech gesture representation learning challenging. How can we learn meaningful gestures representations considering gestures' variability and relationship with speech? This paper tackles this challenge by employing self-supervised contrastive learning techniques to learn gesture representations from skeletal and speech information. We propose an approach that includes both unimodal and multimodal pre-training to ground gesture representations in co-occurring speech. For training, we utilize a face-to-face dialogue dataset rich with representational iconic gestures. We conduct thorough intrinsic evaluations of the learned representations through comparison with human-annotated pairwise gesture similarity. Moreover, we perform a diagnostic probing analysis to assess the possibility of recovering interpretable gesture features from the learned representations. Our results show a significant positive correlation with human-annotated gesture similarity and reveal that the similarity between the learned representations is consistent with well-motivated patterns related to the dynamics of dialogue interaction. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that several features concerning the form of gestures can be recovered from the latent representations. Overall, this study shows that multimodal contrastive learning is a promising approach for learning gesture representations, which opens the door to using such representations in larger-scale gesture analysis studies.</description>

      <title>The potential functions of an international institution for AI safety. Insights from adjacent policy areas and recent trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Governments, industry, and other actors involved in governing AI technologies around the world agree that, while AI offers tremendous promise to benefit the world, appropriate guardrails are required to mitigate risks. Global institutions, including the OECD, the G7, the G20, UNESCO, and the Council of Europe, have already started developing frameworks for ethical and responsible AI governance. While these are important initial steps, they alone fall short of addressing the need for institutionalised international processes to identify and assess potentially harmful AI capabilities. Contributing to the relevant conversation on how to address this gap, this chapter reflects on what functions an international AI safety institute could perform. Based on the analysis of both existing international governance models addressing safety considerations in adjacent policy areas and the newly established national AI safety institutes in the UK and US, the chapter identifies a list of concrete functions that could be performed at the international level. While creating a new international body is not the only way forward, understanding the structure of these bodies from a modular perspective can help us to identify the tools at our disposal. These, we suggest, can be categorised under three functional domains: a) technical research and cooperation, b) safeguards and evaluations, c) policymaking and governance support.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) signals the beginning of a revolutionary period where technological advancement and social change interact to completely reshape economies, work paradigms, and industries worldwide. This essay addresses the opportunities and problems brought about by the AI-driven economy as it examines the effects of AI disruption on the IT sector and information technology education. By comparing the current AI revolution to previous industrial revolutions, we investigate the significant effects of AI technologies on workforce dynamics, employment, and organizational procedures. Human-centered design principles and ethical considerations become crucial requirements for the responsible development and implementation of AI systems in the face of the field's rapid advancements. IT education programs must change to meet the changing demands of the AI era and give students the skills and competencies they need to succeed in a digital world that is changing quickly. In light of AI-driven automation, we also examine the possible advantages and difficulties of moving to a shorter workweek, emphasizing chances to improve worker productivity, well-being, and work-life balance. We can build a more incslusive and sustainable future for the IT industry and beyond, enhancing human capabilities, advancing collective well-being, and fostering a society where AI serves as a force for good by embracing the opportunities presented by AI while proactively addressing its challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of digitalization services via web browsers has simplified our daily routine of doing business. But at the same time, it has made the web browser very attractive for several cyber-attacks. Web phishing is a well-known cyberattack that is used by attackers camouflaging as trustworthy web servers to obtain sensitive user information such as credit card numbers, bank information, personal ID, social security number, and username and passwords. In recent years many techniques have been developed to identify the authentic web pages that users visit and warn them when the webpage is phishing. In this paper, we have developed an extension for Chrome the most favorite web browser, that will serve as a middleware between the user and phishing websites. The Chrome extension named "NoPhish" shall identify a phishing webpage based on several Machine Learning techniques. We have used the training dataset from "PhishTank" and extracted the 22 most popular features as rated by the Alexa database. The training algorithms used are Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and k-Nearest Neighbor. The performance results show that Random Forest delivers the best precision.</description>

      <title>AI Literacy for All: Adjustable Interdisciplinary Socio-technical Curriculum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a curriculum, "AI Literacy for All," to promote an interdisciplinary understanding of AI, its socio-technical implications, and its practical applications for all levels of education. With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), there is a need for AI literacy that goes beyond the traditional AI education curriculum. AI literacy has been conceptualized in various ways, including public literacy, competency building for designers, conceptual understanding of AI concepts, and domain-specific upskilling. Most of these conceptualizations were established before the public release of Generative AI (Gen-AI) tools like ChatGPT. AI education has focused on the principles and applications of AI through a technical lens that emphasizes the mastery of AI principles, the mathematical foundations underlying these technologies, and the programming and mathematical skills necessary to implement AI solutions. In AI Literacy for All, we emphasize a balanced curriculum that includes technical and non-technical learning outcomes to enable a conceptual understanding and critical evaluation of AI technologies in an interdisciplinary socio-technical context. The paper presents four pillars of AI literacy: understanding the scope and technical dimensions of AI, learning how to interact with Gen-AI in an informed and responsible way, the socio-technical issues of ethical and responsible AI, and the social and future implications of AI. While it is important to include all learning outcomes for AI education in a Computer Science major, the learning outcomes can be adjusted for other learning contexts, including, non-CS majors, high school summer camps, the adult workforce, and the public. This paper advocates for a shift in AI literacy education to offer a more interdisciplinary socio-technical approach as a pathway to broaden participation in AI.</description>

      <title>An Examination of Offline-Trained Encoders in Vision-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our research investigates the challenges Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) faces in complex, Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) such as autonomous driving (AD), and proposes a solution for vision-based navigation in these environments. Partial observability reduces RL performance significantly, and this can be mitigated by augmenting sensor information and data fusion to reflect a more Markovian environment. However, this necessitates an increasingly complex perception module, whose training via RL is complicated due to inherent limitations. As the neural network architecture becomes more complex, the reward function's effectiveness as an error signal diminishes since the only source of supervision is the reward, which is often noisy, sparse, and delayed. Task-irrelevant elements in images, such as the sky or certain objects, pose additional complexities. Our research adopts an offline-trained encoder to leverage large video datasets through self-supervised learning to learn generalizable representations. Then, we train a head network on top of these representations through DRL to learn to control an ego vehicle in the CARLA AD simulator. This study presents a broad investigation of the impact of different learning schemes for offline-training of encoders on the performance of DRL agents in challenging AD tasks. Furthermore, we show that the features learned by watching BDD100K driving videos can be directly transferred to achieve lane following and collision avoidance in CARLA simulator, in a zero-shot learning fashion. Finally, we explore the impact of various architectural decisions for the RL networks to utilize the transferred representations efficiently. Therefore, in this work, we introduce and validate an optimal way for obtaining suitable representations of the environment, and transferring them to RL networks.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Induction Heads: Provable Training Dynamics and Feature Learning in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a cornerstone of large language model (LLM) functionality, yet its theoretical foundations remain elusive due to the complexity of transformer architectures. In particular, most existing work only theoretically explains how the attention mechanism facilitates ICL under certain data models. It remains unclear how the other building blocks of the transformer contribute to ICL. To address this question, we study how a two-attention-layer transformer is trained to perform ICL on $n$-gram Markov chain data, where each token in the Markov chain statistically depends on the previous $n$ tokens. We analyze a sophisticated transformer model featuring relative positional embedding, multi-head softmax attention, and a feed-forward layer with normalization. We prove that the gradient flow with respect to a cross-entropy ICL loss converges to a limiting model that performs a generalized version of the induction head mechanism with a learned feature, resulting from the congruous contribution of all the building blocks. In the limiting model, the first attention layer acts as a $\mathit{copier}$, copying past tokens within a given window to each position, and the feed-forward network with normalization acts as a $\mathit{selector}$ that generates a feature vector by only looking at informationally relevant parents from the window. Finally, the second attention layer is a $\mathit{classifier}$ that compares these features with the feature at the output position, and uses the resulting similarity scores to generate the desired output. Our theory is further validated by experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing number of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks poses a major threat to the Internet, highlighting the importance of DDoS mitigation. Most existing approaches require complex training methods to learn data features, which increases the complexity and generality of the application. In this paper, we propose DrLLM, which aims to mine anomalous traffic information in zero-shot scenarios through Large Language Models (LLMs). To bridge the gap between DrLLM and existing approaches, we embed the global and local information of the traffic data into the reasoning paradigm and design three modules, namely Knowledge Embedding, Token Embedding, and Progressive Role Reasoning, for data representation and reasoning. In addition we explore the generalization of prompt engineering in the cybersecurity domain to improve the classification capability of DrLLM. Our ablation experiments demonstrate the applicability of DrLLM in zero-shot scenarios and further demonstrate the potential of LLMs in the network domains. DrLLM implementation code has been open-sourced at https://github.com/liuup/DrLLM.</description>

      <title>Eureka: Evaluating and Understanding Large Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rigorous and reproducible evaluation is critical for assessing the state of the art and for guiding scientific advances in Artificial Intelligence. Evaluation is challenging in practice due to several reasons, including benchmark saturation, lack of transparency in methods used for measurement, development challenges in extracting measurements for generative tasks, and, more generally, the extensive number of capabilities required for a well-rounded comparison across models. We make three contributions to alleviate the above challenges. First, we present Eureka, an open-source framework for standardizing evaluations of large foundation models beyond single-score reporting and rankings. Second, we introduce Eureka-Bench as an extensible collection of benchmarks testing capabilities that (i) are still challenging for state-of-the-art models and (ii) represent fundamental but overlooked language and multimodal capabilities. The inherent space for improvement in non-saturated benchmarks enables us to discover meaningful differences between models at a capability level. Third, using Eureka, we conduct an analysis of 12 state-of-the-art models, providing in-depth insights into failure understanding and model comparison, which can be leveraged to plan targeted improvements. In contrast to recent trends in reports and leaderboards showing absolute rankings and claims for one model or another to be the best, our analysis shows that there is no such best model. Different models have different strengths, but there are models that appear more often than others as best performers for some capabilities. Despite the recent improvements, current models still struggle with several fundamental capabilities including detailed image understanding, benefiting from multimodal input when available rather than fully relying on language, factuality and grounding for information retrieval, and over refusals.</description>

      <title>On the limits of agency in agent-based models</title>

Abstract: Agent-based modeling (ABM) seeks to understand the behavior of complex systems by simulating a collection of agents that act and interact within an environment. Their practical utility requires capturing realistic environment dynamics and adaptive agent behavior while efficiently simulating million-size populations. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to enhance ABMs by using LLMs as agents with further potential to capture adaptive behavior. However, the computational infeasibility of using LLMs for large populations has hindered their widespread adoption. In this paper, we introduce AgentTorch -- a framework that scales ABMs to millions of agents while capturing high-resolution agent behavior using LLMs. We benchmark the utility of LLMs as ABM agents, exploring the trade-off between simulation scale and individual agency. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a case study, we demonstrate how AgentTorch can simulate 8.4 million agents representing New York City, capturing the impact of isolation and employment behavior on health and economic outcomes. We compare the performance of different agent architectures based on heuristic and LLM agents in predicting disease waves and unemployment rates. Furthermore, we showcase AgentTorch's capabilities for retrospective, counterfactual, and prospective analyses, highlighting how adaptive agent behavior can help overcome the limitations of historical data in policy design. AgentTorch is an open-source project actively being used for policy-making and scientific discovery around the world. The framework is available here: github.com/AgentTorch/AgentTorch.</description>

      <title>Protecting Copyright of Medical Pre-trained Language Models: Training-Free Backdoor Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-training language models followed by fine-tuning on specific tasks is standard in NLP, but traditional models often underperform when applied to the medical domain, leading to the development of specialized medical pre-trained language models (Med-PLMs). These models are valuable assets but are vulnerable to misuse and theft, requiring copyright protection. However, no existing watermarking methods are tailored for Med-PLMs, and adapting general PLMs watermarking techniques to the medical domain faces challenges such as task incompatibility, loss of fidelity, and inefficiency. To address these issues, we propose the first training-free backdoor watermarking method for Med-PLMs. Our method uses rare special symbols as trigger words, which do not impact downstream task performance, embedding watermarks by replacing their original embeddings with those of specific medical terms in the Med-PLMs' word embeddings layer. After fine-tuning the watermarked Med-PLMs on various medical downstream tasks, the final models (FMs) respond to the trigger words in the same way they would to the corresponding medical terms. This property can be utilized to extract the watermark. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high fidelity while effectively extracting watermarks across various medical downstream tasks. Additionally, our method demonstrates robustness against various attacks and significantly enhances the efficiency of watermark embedding, reducing the embedding time from 10 hours to 10 seconds.</description>

      <title>ASFT: Aligned Supervised Fine-Tuning through Absolute Likelihood</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a method for enhancing model performance by directly optimizing for the preferences or rankings of outcomes, instead of traditional loss functions. This approach has proven effective in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. Despite its widespread use across various tasks, DPO has been criticized for its sensitivity to the effectiveness of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and its limitations in enabling models to learn human-preferred responses, leading to less satisfactory performance. To address these limitations, we propose Aligned Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT), an effective approach that better aligns LLMs with pair-wise datasets by optimizing absolute likelihood for each response, rather than using the Bradley-Terry model, and eliminates the need for a reference model. Through theoretical gradient analysis, we demonstrate that ASFT mitigates the issue where the DPO loss function decreases the probability of generating human-dispreferred data at a faster rate than it increases the probability of producing preferred data. Additionally, we compare ASFT to DPO and its latest variants, such as the single-step approach ORPO, using the latest instruction-tuned model Llama3, which has been fine-tuned on UltraFeedback and HH-RLHF. We evaluated performance on instruction-following benchmarks like MT-Bench and traditional text generation metrics such as BLEU-4 and ROUGE-L. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ASFT is an effective alignment approach, consistently outperforming existing methods.</description>

      <title>Detection Made Easy: Potentials of Large Language Models for Solidity Vulnerabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-scale deployment of Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum mainnet has increasingly attracted financially-motivated attackers in recent years. A few now-infamous attacks in Ethereum's history includes DAO attack in 2016 (50 million dollars lost), Parity Wallet hack in 2017 (146 million dollars locked), Beautychain's token BEC in 2018 (900 million dollars market value fell to 0), and NFT gaming blockchain breach in 2022 ($600 million in Ether stolen). This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of the use of large language models (LLMs) and their capabilities in detecting OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities in Solidity. We introduce a novel, class-balanced, structured, and labeled dataset named VulSmart, which we use to benchmark and compare the performance of open-source LLMs such as CodeLlama, Llama2, CodeT5 and Falcon, alongside closed-source models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o Mini. Our proposed SmartVD framework is rigorously tested against these models through extensive automated and manual evaluations, utilizing BLEU and ROUGE metrics to assess the effectiveness of vulnerability detection in smart contracts. We also explore three distinct prompting strategies-zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought-to evaluate the multi-class classification and generative capabilities of the SmartVD framework. Our findings reveal that SmartVD outperforms its open-source counterparts and even exceeds the performance of closed-source base models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 Mini. After fine-tuning, the closed-source models, GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o Mini, achieved remarkable performance with 99% accuracy in detecting vulnerabilities, 94% in identifying their types, and 98% in determining severity. Notably, SmartVD performs best with the `chain-of-thought' prompting technique, whereas the fine-tuned closed-source models excel with the `zero-shot' prompting approach.</description>

      <title>A Tie-breaking based Local Search Algorithm for Stable Matching Problems</title>

Abstract: The stable marriage problem with incomplete lists and ties (SMTI) and the hospitals/residents problem with ties (HRT) are important in matching theory with broad practical applications. In this paper, we introduce a tie-breaking based local search algorithm (TBLS) designed to achieve a weakly stable matching of maximum size for both the SMTI and HRT problems. TBLS begins by arbitrarily resolving all ties and iteratively refines the tie-breaking strategy by adjusting the relative order within ties based on preference ranks and the current stable matching. Additionally, we introduce TBLS-E, an equity-focused variant of TBLS, specifically designed for the SMTI problem. This variant maintains the objective of maximizing matching size, while enhancing equity through two simple modifications. In comparison with ten other approximation and local search algorithms, TBLS achieves the highest matching size, while TBLS-E exhibits the lowest sex equality cost. Significantly, TBLS-E preserves a matching size comparable to that of TBLS. Both our algorithms demonstrate faster computational speed than other local search algorithms in solving large-sized instances.</description>

Abstract: In the age of powerful diffusion models such as DALL-E and Stable Diffusion, many in the digital art community have suffered style mimicry attacks due to fine-tuning these models on their works. The ability to mimic an artist's style via text-to-image diffusion models raises serious ethical issues, especially without explicit consent. Glaze, a tool that applies various ranges of perturbations to digital art, has shown significant success in preventing style mimicry attacks, at the cost of artifacts ranging from imperceptible noise to severe quality degradation. The release of Glaze has sparked further discussions regarding the effectiveness of similar protection methods. In this paper, we propose GLEAN- applying I2I generative networks to strip perturbations from Glazed images, evaluating the performance of style mimicry attacks before and after GLEAN on the results of Glaze. GLEAN aims to support and enhance Glaze by highlighting its limitations and encouraging further development.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly large language models (LLMs), made a significant impact on how researchers study microbiome and metagenomics data. Microbial protein and genomic sequences, like natural languages, form a language of life, enabling the adoption of LLMs to extract useful insights from complex microbial ecologies. In this paper, we review applications of deep learning and language models in analyzing microbiome and metagenomics data. We focus on problem formulations, necessary datasets, and the integration of language modeling techniques. We provide an extensive overview of protein/genomic language modeling and their contributions to microbiome studies. We also discuss applications such as novel viromics language modeling, biosynthetic gene cluster prediction, and knowledge integration for metagenomics studies.</description>

      <title>Veridical Data Science for Medical Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of foundation models (FMs) such as large language models (LLMs) has led to a cultural shift in data science, both in medicine and beyond. This shift involves moving away from specialized predictive models trained for specific, well-defined domain questions to generalist FMs pre-trained on vast amounts of unstructured data, which can then be adapted to various clinical tasks and questions. As a result, the standard data science workflow in medicine has been fundamentally altered; the foundation model lifecycle (FMLC) now includes distinct upstream and downstream processes, in which computational resources, model and data access, and decision-making power are distributed among multiple stakeholders. At their core, FMs are fundamentally statistical models, and this new workflow challenges the principles of Veridical Data Science (VDS), hindering the rigorous statistical analysis expected in transparent and scientifically reproducible data science practices. We critically examine the medical FMLC in light of the core principles of VDS: predictability, computability, and stability (PCS), and explain how it deviates from the standard data science workflow. Finally, we propose recommendations for a reimagined medical FMLC that expands and refines the PCS principles for VDS including considering the computational and accessibility constraints inherent to FMs.</description>

      <title>WaveMixSR-V2: Enhancing Super-resolution with Higher Efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in single image super-resolution have been predominantly driven by token mixers and transformer architectures. WaveMixSR utilized the WaveMix architecture, employing a two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform for spatial token mixing, achieving superior performance in super-resolution tasks with remarkable resource efficiency. In this work, we present an enhanced version of the WaveMixSR architecture by (1) replacing the traditional transpose convolution layer with a pixel shuffle operation and (2) implementing a multistage design for higher resolution tasks ($4\times$). Our experiments demonstrate that our enhanced model -- WaveMixSR-V2 -- outperforms other architectures in multiple super-resolution tasks, achieving state-of-the-art for the BSD100 dataset, while also consuming fewer resources, exhibits higher parameter efficiency, lower latency and higher throughput. Our code is available at https://github.com/pranavphoenix/WaveMixSR.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Quasi-Hyperbolic Discounting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has traditionally been studied with exponential discounting or the average reward setup, mainly due to their mathematical tractability. However, such frameworks fall short of accurately capturing human behavior, which has a bias towards immediate gratification. Quasi-Hyperbolic (QH) discounting is a simple alternative for modeling this bias. Unlike in traditional discounting, though, the optimal QH-policy, starting from some time $t_1,$ can be different to the one starting from $t_2.$ Hence, the future self of an agent, if it is naive or impatient, can deviate from the policy that is optimal at the start, leading to sub-optimal overall returns. To prevent this behavior, an alternative is to work with a policy anchored in a Markov Perfect Equilibrium (MPE). In this work, we propose the first model-free algorithm for finding an MPE. Using a two-timescale analysis, we show that, if our algorithm converges, then the limit must be an MPE. We also validate this claim numerically for the standard inventory system with stochastic demands. Our work significantly advances the practical application of reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Manifold-Constrained Nucleus-Level Denoising Diffusion Model for Structure-Based Drug Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence models have shown great potential in structure-based drug design, generating ligands with high binding affinities. However, existing models have often overlooked a crucial physical constraint: atoms must maintain a minimum pairwise distance to avoid separation violation, a phenomenon governed by the balance of attractive and repulsive forces. To mitigate such separation violations, we propose NucleusDiff. It models the interactions between atomic nuclei and their surrounding electron clouds by enforcing the distance constraint between the nuclei and manifolds. We quantitatively evaluate NucleusDiff using the CrossDocked2020 dataset and a COVID-19 therapeutic target, demonstrating that NucleusDiff reduces violation rate by up to 100.00% and enhances binding affinity by up to 22.16%, surpassing state-of-the-art models for structure-based drug design. We also provide qualitative analysis through manifold sampling, visually confirming the effectiveness of NucleusDiff in reducing separation violations and improving binding affinities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting the future trajectories of surrounding agents is crucial for autonomous vehicles to ensure safe, efficient, and comfortable route planning. While model ensembling has improved prediction accuracy in various fields, its application in trajectory prediction is limited due to the multi-modal nature of predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling method applicable to trajectory prediction based on the predictions of multiple models. We first show that conventional sampling based on predicted probabilities can degrade performance due to missing alignment between models. To address this problem, we introduce a new method that generates optimal trajectories from a set of neural networks, framing it as a risk minimization problem with a variable loss function. By using state-of-the-art models as base learners, our approach constructs diverse and effective ensembles for optimal trajectory sampling. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes prediction dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art techniques, achieving top ranks on the leaderboard. We also provide a comprehensive empirical study on ensembling strategies, offering insights into their effectiveness. Our findings highlight the potential of advanced ensembling techniques in trajectory prediction, significantly improving predictive performance and paving the way for more reliable predicted trajectories.</description>

      <title>Opponent Shaping for Antibody Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anti-viral therapies are typically designed or evolved towards the current strains of a virus. In learning terms, this corresponds to a myopic best response, i.e., not considering the possible adaptive moves of the opponent. However, therapy-induced selective pressures act on viral antigens to drive the emergence of mutated strains, against which initial therapies have reduced efficacy. To motivate our work, we consider antibody designs that target not only the current viral strains but also the wide range of possible future variants that the virus might evolve into under the evolutionary pressure exerted by said antibodies. Building on a computational model of binding between antibodies and viral antigens (the Absolut! framework), we design and implement a genetic simulation of the viral evolutionary escape. Crucially, this allows our antibody optimisation algorithm to consider and influence the entire escape curve of the virus, i.e. to guide (or ''shape'') the viral evolution. This is inspired by opponent shaping which, in general-sum learning, accounts for the adaptation of the co-player rather than playing a myopic best response. Hence we call the optimised antibodies shapers. Within our simulations, we demonstrate that our shapers target both current and simulated future viral variants, outperforming the antibodies chosen in a myopic way. Furthermore, we show that shapers exert specific evolutionary pressure on the virus compared to myopic antibodies. Altogether, shapers modify the evolutionary trajectories of viral strains and minimise the viral escape compared to their myopic counterparts. While this is a simple model, we hope that our proposed paradigm will enable the discovery of better long-lived vaccines and antibody therapies in the future, enabled by rapid advancements in the capabilities of simulation tools.</description>

Abstract: The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is a complex combinatorial optimization problem. There has been growing interest in using online Reinforcement Learning (RL) for JSSP. While online RL can quickly find acceptable solutions, especially for larger problems, it produces lower-quality results than traditional methods like Constraint Programming (CP). A significant downside of online RL is that it cannot learn from existing data, such as solutions generated from CP, requiring them to train from scratch, leading to sample inefficiency and making them unable to learn from more optimal examples. We introduce Offline Reinforcement Learning for Learning to Dispatch (Offline-LD), a novel approach for JSSP that addresses these limitations. Offline-LD adapts two CQL-based Q-learning methods (mQRDQN and discrete mSAC) for maskable action spaces, introduces a new entropy bonus modification for discrete SAC, and exploits reward normalization through preprocessing. Our experiments show that Offline-LD outperforms online RL on both generated and benchmark instances. By introducing noise into the dataset, we achieve similar or better results than those obtained from the expert dataset, indicating that a more diverse training set is preferable because it contains counterfactual information.</description>

      <title>CSKV: Training-Efficient Channel Shrinking for KV Cache in Long-Context Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to process long-context tasks. However, the large memory overhead of the key-value (KV) cache poses significant challenges in long-context scenarios. Existing training-free KV cache compression methods typically focus on quantization and token pruning, which have compression limits, and excessive sparsity can lead to severe performance degradation. Other methods design new architectures with less KV overhead but require significant training overhead. To address the above two drawbacks, we further explore the redundancy in the channel dimension and apply an architecture-level design with minor training costs. Therefore, we introduce CSKV, a training-efficient Channel Shrinking technique for KV cache compression: (1) We first analyze the singular value distribution of the KV cache, revealing significant redundancy and compression potential along the channel dimension. Based on this observation, we propose using low-rank decomposition for key and value layers and storing the low-dimension features. (2) To preserve model performance, we introduce a bi-branch KV cache, including a window-based full-precision KV cache and a low-precision compressed KV cache. (3) To reduce the training costs, we minimize the layer-wise reconstruction loss for the compressed KV cache instead of retraining the entire LLMs. Extensive experiments show that CSKV can reduce the memory overhead of the KV cache by 80% while maintaining the model's long-context capability. Moreover, we show that our method can be seamlessly combined with quantization to further reduce the memory overhead, achieving a compression ratio of up to 95%.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer</title>

Abstract: Transformers stand as the cornerstone of mordern deep learning. Traditionally, these models rely on multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers to mix the information between channels. In this paper, we introduce the Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), a novel architecture that replaces MLP layers with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers to enhance the expressiveness and performance of the model. Integrating KANs into transformers, however, is no easy feat, especially when scaled up. Specifically, we identify three key challenges: (C1) Base function. The standard B-spline function used in KANs is not optimized for parallel computing on modern hardware, resulting in slower inference speeds. (C2) Parameter and Computation Inefficiency. KAN requires a unique function for each input-output pair, making the computation extremely large. (C3) Weight initialization. The initialization of weights in KANs is particularly challenging due to their learnable activation functions, which are critical for achieving convergence in deep neural networks. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose three key solutions: (S1) Rational basis. We replace B-spline functions with rational functions to improve compatibility with modern GPUs. By implementing this in CUDA, we achieve faster computations. (S2) Group KAN. We share the activation weights through a group of neurons, to reduce the computational load without sacrificing performance. (S3) Variance-preserving initialization. We carefully initialize the activation weights to make sure that the activation variance is maintained across layers. With these designs, KAT scales effectively and readily outperforms traditional MLP-based transformers.</description>

      <title>Exploring Fine-tuned Generative Models for Keyphrase Selection: A Case Study for Russian</title>

Abstract: Keyphrase selection plays a pivotal role within the domain of scholarly texts, facilitating efficient information retrieval, summarization, and indexing. In this work, we explored how to apply fine-tuned generative transformer-based models to the specific task of keyphrase selection within Russian scientific texts. We experimented with four distinct generative models, such as ruT5, ruGPT, mT5, and mBART, and evaluated their performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings. The experiments were conducted on the texts of Russian scientific abstracts from four domains: mathematics \&amp; computer science, history, medicine, and linguistics. The use of generative models, namely mBART, led to gains in in-domain performance (up to 4.9\% in BERTScore, 9.0\% in ROUGE-1, and 12.2\% in F1-score) over three keyphrase extraction baselines for the Russian language. Although the results for cross-domain usage were significantly lower, they still demonstrated the capability to surpass baseline performances in several cases, underscoring the promising potential for further exploration and refinement in this research field.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Uncertainty for Safe Social Navigation using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots are increasingly employed in pedestrian-rich environments where safe navigation and appropriate human interaction are crucial. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enables socially integrated robot behavior, challenges persist in novel or perturbed scenarios to indicate when and why the policy is uncertain. Unknown uncertainty in decision-making can lead to collisions or human discomfort and is one reason why safe and risk-aware navigation is still an open problem. This work introduces a novel approach that integrates aleatoric, epistemic, and predictive uncertainty estimation into a DRL-based navigation framework for uncertainty estimates in decision-making. We, therefore, incorporate Observation-Dependent Variance (ODV) and dropout into the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. For different types of perturbations, we compare the ability of Deep Ensembles and Monte-Carlo Dropout (MC-Dropout) to estimate the uncertainties of the policy. In uncertain decision-making situations, we propose to change the robot's social behavior to conservative collision avoidance. The results show that the ODV-PPO algorithm converges faster with better generalization and disentangles the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. In addition, the MC-Dropout approach is more sensitive to perturbations and capable to correlate the uncertainty type to the perturbation type better. With the proposed safe action selection scheme, the robot can navigate in perturbed environments with fewer collisions.</description>

Abstract: We address a variant of multi-agent path finding in continuous environment (CE-MAPF), where agents move along sets of smooth curves. Collisions between agents are resolved via avoidance in the space domain. A new Continuous Environment Conflict-Based Search (CE-CBS) algorithm is proposed in this work. CE-CBS combines conflict-based search (CBS) for the high-level search framework with RRT* for low-level path planning. The CE-CBS algorithm is tested under various settings on diverse CE-MAPF instances. Experimental results show that CE-CBS is competitive w.r.t. to other algorithms that consider continuous aspect in MAPF such as MAPF with continuous time.</description>

      <title>MotIF: Motion Instruction Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While success in many robotics tasks can be determined by only observing the final state and how it differs from the initial state - e.g., if an apple is picked up - many tasks require observing the full motion of the robot to correctly determine success. For example, brushing hair requires repeated strokes that correspond to the contours and type of hair. Prior works often use off-the-shelf vision-language models (VLMs) as success detectors; however, when success depends on the full trajectory, VLMs struggle to make correct judgments for two reasons. First, modern VLMs are trained only on single frames, and cannot capture changes over a full trajectory. Second, even if we provide state-of-the-art VLMs with an aggregate input of multiple frames, they still fail to detect success due to a lack of robot data. Our key idea is to fine-tune VLMs using abstract representations that are able to capture trajectory-level information such as the path the robot takes by overlaying keypoint trajectories on the final image. We propose motion instruction fine-tuning (MotIF), a method that fine-tunes VLMs using the aforementioned abstract representations to semantically ground the robot's behavior in the environment. To benchmark and fine-tune VLMs for robotic motion understanding, we introduce the MotIF-1K dataset containing 653 human and 369 robot demonstrations across 13 task categories. MotIF assesses the success of robot motion given the image observation of the trajectory, task instruction, and motion description. Our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs by at least twice in precision and 56.1% in recall, generalizing across unseen motions, tasks, and environments. Finally, we demonstrate practical applications of MotIF in refining and terminating robot planning, and ranking trajectories on how they align with task and motion descriptions.

      <title>Encoding Reusable Multi-Robot Planning Strategies as Abstract Hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Robot Task Planning (MR-TP) is the search for a discrete-action plan a team of robots should take to complete a task. The complexity of such problems scales exponentially with the number of robots and task complexity, making them challenging for online solution. To accelerate MR-TP over a system's lifetime, this work looks at combining two recent advances: (i) Decomposable State Space Hypergraph (DaSH), a novel hypergraph-based framework to efficiently model and solve MR-TP problems; and \mbox{(ii) learning-by-abstraction,} a technique that enables automatic extraction of generalizable planning strategies from individual planning experiences for later reuse. Specifically, we wish to extend this strategy-learning technique, originally designed for single-robot planning, to benefit multi-robot planning using hypergraph-based MR-TP.</description>

      <title>Playground v3: Improving Text-to-Image Alignment with Deep-Fusion Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Playground v3 (PGv3), our latest text-to-image model that achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance across multiple testing benchmarks, excels in graphic design abilities and introduces new capabilities. Unlike traditional text-to-image generative models that rely on pre-trained language models like T5 or CLIP text encoders, our approach fully integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with a novel structure that leverages text conditions exclusively from a decoder-only LLM. Additionally, to enhance image captioning quality-we developed an in-house captioner, capable of generating captions with varying levels of detail, enriching the diversity of text structures. We also introduce a new benchmark CapsBench to evaluate detailed image captioning performance. Experimental results demonstrate that PGv3 excels in text prompt adherence, complex reasoning, and accurate text rendering. User preference studies indicate the super-human graphic design ability of our model for common design applications, such as stickers, posters, and logo designs. Furthermore, PGv3 introduces new capabilities, including precise RGB color control and robust multilingual understanding.</description>

      <title>Model-in-the-Loop (MILO): Accelerating Multimodal AI Data Annotation with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for AI training data has transformed data annotation into a global industry, but traditional approaches relying on human annotators are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to inconsistent quality. We propose the Model-in-the-Loop (MILO) framework, which integrates AI/ML models into the annotation process. Our research introduces a collaborative paradigm that leverages the strengths of both professional human annotators and large language models (LLMs). By employing LLMs as pre-annotation and real-time assistants, and judges on annotator responses, MILO enables effective interaction patterns between human annotators and LLMs. Three empirical studies on multimodal data annotation demonstrate MILO's efficacy in reducing handling time, improving data quality, and enhancing annotator experiences. We also introduce quality rubrics for flexible evaluation and fine-grained feedback on open-ended annotations. The MILO framework has implications for accelerating AI/ML development, reducing reliance on human annotation alone, and promoting better alignment between human and machine values.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Speech Models for Word-Level Stuttered Speech Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical diagnosis of stuttering requires an assessment by a licensed speech-language pathologist. However, this process is time-consuming and requires clinicians with training and experience in stuttering and fluency disorders. Unfortunately, only a small percentage of speech-language pathologists report being comfortable working with individuals who stutter, which is inadequate to accommodate for the 80 million individuals who stutter worldwide. Developing machine learning models for detecting stuttered speech would enable universal and automated screening for stuttering, enabling speech pathologists to identify and follow up with patients who are most likely to be diagnosed with a stuttering speech disorder. Previous research in this area has predominantly focused on utterance-level detection, which is not sufficient for clinical settings where word-level annotation of stuttering is the norm. In this study, we curated a stuttered speech dataset with word-level annotations and introduced a word-level stuttering speech detection model leveraging self-supervised speech models. Our evaluation demonstrates that our model surpasses previous approaches in word-level stuttering speech detection. Additionally, we conducted an extensive ablation analysis of our method, providing insight into the most important aspects of adapting self-supervised speech models for stuttered speech detection.</description>

      <title>Self-Attention Limits Working Memory Capacity of Transformer-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work on Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has revealed striking limits in their working memory capacity, similar to what has been found in human behavioral studies. Specifically, these models' performance drops significantly on N-back tasks as N increases. However, there is still a lack of mechanistic interpretability as to why this phenomenon would arise. Inspired by the executive attention theory from behavioral sciences, we hypothesize that the self-attention mechanism within Transformer-based models might be responsible for their working memory capacity limits. To test this hypothesis, we train vanilla decoder-only transformers to perform N-back tasks and find that attention scores gradually aggregate to the N-back positions over training, suggesting that the model masters the task by learning a strategy to pay attention to the relationship between the current position and the N-back position. Critically, we find that the total entropy of the attention score matrix increases as N increases, suggesting that the dispersion of attention scores might be the cause of the capacity limit observed in N-back tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating and updating pixel art character sprites with many frames spanning different animations and poses takes time and can quickly become repetitive. However, that can be partially automated to allow artists to focus on more creative tasks. In this work, we concentrate on creating pixel art character sprites in a target pose from images of them facing other three directions. We present a novel approach to character generation by framing the problem as a missing data imputation task. Our proposed generative adversarial networks model receives the images of a character in all available domains and produces the image of the missing pose. We evaluated our approach in the scenarios with one, two, and three missing images, achieving similar or better results to the state-of-the-art when more images are available. We also evaluate the impact of the proposed changes to the base architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of classic information-theoretic measures of predictive uncertainty in online language processing, based on the simulation of expected continuations of incremental linguistic contexts. Our framework provides a formal definition of anticipatory and responsive measures, and it equips experimenters with the tools to define new, more expressive measures beyond standard next-symbol entropy and surprisal. While extracting these standard quantities from language models is convenient, we demonstrate that using Monte Carlo simulation to estimate alternative responsive and anticipatory measures pays off empirically: New special cases of our generalized formula exhibit enhanced predictive power compared to surprisal for human cloze completion probability as well as ELAN, LAN, and N400 amplitudes, and greater complementarity with surprisal in predicting reading times.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in automatic code generation using large language models (LLMs) have brought us closer to fully automated secure software development. However, existing approaches often rely on a single agent for code generation, which struggles to produce secure, vulnerability-free code. Traditional program synthesis with LLMs has primarily focused on functional correctness, often neglecting critical dynamic security implications that happen during runtime. To address these challenges, we propose AutoSafeCoder, a multi-agent framework that leverages LLM-driven agents for code generation, vulnerability analysis, and security enhancement through continuous collaboration. The framework consists of three agents: a Coding Agent responsible for code generation, a Static Analyzer Agent identifying vulnerabilities, and a Fuzzing Agent performing dynamic testing using a mutation-based fuzzing approach to detect runtime errors. Our contribution focuses on ensuring the safety of multi-agent code generation by integrating dynamic and static testing in an iterative process during code generation by LLM that improves security. Experiments using the SecurityEval dataset demonstrate a 13% reduction in code vulnerabilities compared to baseline LLMs, with no compromise in functionality.</description>

      <title>VulnLLMEval: A Framework for Evaluating Large Language Models in Software Vulnerability Detection and Patching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in tasks like code translation, prompting interest in their potential for automating software vulnerability detection (SVD) and patching (SVP). To further research in this area, establishing a benchmark is essential for evaluating the strengths and limitations of LLMs in these tasks. Despite their capabilities, questions remain regarding whether LLMs can accurately analyze complex vulnerabilities and generate appropriate patches. This paper introduces VulnLLMEval, a framework designed to assess the performance of LLMs in identifying and patching vulnerabilities in C code. Our study includes 307 real-world vulnerabilities extracted from the Linux kernel, creating a well-curated dataset that includes both vulnerable and patched code. This dataset, based on real-world code, provides a diverse and representative testbed for evaluating LLM performance in SVD and SVP tasks, offering a robust foundation for rigorous assessment. Our results reveal that LLMs often struggle with distinguishing between vulnerable and patched code. Furthermore, in SVP tasks, these models tend to oversimplify the code, producing solutions that may not be directly usable without further refinement.</description>

      <title>Are Deep Learning Models Robust to Partial Object Occlusion in Visual Recognition Tasks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image classification models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), perform well on a variety of classification tasks but struggle under conditions of partial occlusion, i.e., conditions in which objects are partially covered from the view of a camera. Methods to improve performance under occlusion, including data augmentation, part-based clustering, and more inherently robust architectures, including Vision Transformer (ViT) models, have, to some extent, been evaluated on their ability to classify objects under partial occlusion. However, evaluations of these methods have largely relied on images containing artificial occlusion, which are typically computer-generated and therefore inexpensive to label. Additionally, methods are rarely compared against each other, and many methods are compared against early, now outdated, deep learning models. We contribute the Image Recognition Under Occlusion (IRUO) dataset, based on the recently developed Occluded Video Instance Segmentation (OVIS) dataset (arXiv:2102.01558). IRUO utilizes real-world and artificially occluded images to test and benchmark leading methods' robustness to partial occlusion in visual recognition tasks. In addition, we contribute the design and results of a human study using images from IRUO that evaluates human classification performance at multiple levels and types of occlusion. We find that modern CNN-based models show improved recognition accuracy on occluded images compared to earlier CNN-based models, and ViT-based models are more accurate than CNN-based models on occluded images, performing only modestly worse than human accuracy. We also find that certain types of occlusion, including diffuse occlusion, where relevant objects are seen through "holes" in occluders such as fences and leaves, can greatly reduce the accuracy of deep recognition models as compared to humans, especially those with CNN backbones.</description>

      <title>Model Tells Itself Where to Attend: Faithfulness Meets Automatic Attention Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various real-world tasks. However, they often struggle to fully comprehend and effectively utilize their input contexts, resulting in responses that are unfaithful or hallucinated. This difficulty increases for contexts that are long or contain distracting information, which can divert LLMs from fully capturing essential evidence. To address this issue, many works use prompting to help LLMs utilize contextual information more faithfully. For instance, iterative prompting highlights key information in two steps that first ask the LLM to identify important pieces of context and then derive answers accordingly. However, prompting methods are constrained to highlighting key information implicitly in token space, which is often insufficient to fully steer the model's attention. To improve model faithfulness more reliably, we propose AutoPASTA, a method that automatically identifies key contextual information and explicitly highlights it by steering an LLM's attention scores. Like prompting, AutoPASTA is applied at inference time and does not require changing any model parameters. Our experiments on open-book QA demonstrate that AutoPASTA effectively enables models to grasp essential contextual information, leading to substantially improved model faithfulness and performance, e.g., an average improvement of 7.95% for LLAMA3-70B-Instruct. Code will be publicly available at https://github.com/QingruZhang/AutoPASTA .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that a single-layer neural network using Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) activation can solve the XOR problem, a simple fact that has been overlooked so far. We compare this solution to the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and the Growing Cosine Unit (GCU) activation function and explain why PReLU enables this capability. Our results show that the single-layer PReLU network can achieve 100\% success rate in a wider range of learning rates while using only three learnable parameters.</description>

      <title>Challenging Fairness: A Comprehensive Exploration of Bias in LLM-Based Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based recommendation systems provide more comprehensive recommendations than traditional systems by deeply analyzing content and user behavior. However, these systems often exhibit biases, favoring mainstream content while marginalizing non-traditional options due to skewed training data. This study investigates the intricate relationship between bias and LLM-based recommendation systems, with a focus on music, song, and book recommendations across diverse demographic and cultural groups. Through a comprehensive analysis conducted over different LLM-models, this paper evaluates the impact of bias on recommendation outcomes. Our findings reveal that bias is so deeply ingrained within these systems that even a simpler intervention like prompt engineering can significantly reduce bias, underscoring the pervasive nature of the issue. Moreover, factors like intersecting identities and contextual information, such as socioeconomic status, further amplify these biases, demonstrating the complexity and depth of the challenges faced in creating fair recommendations across different groups.</description>

      <title>PDMX: A Large-Scale Public Domain MusicXML Dataset for Symbolic Music Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent explosion of generative AI-Music systems has raised numerous concerns over data copyright, licensing music from musicians, and the conflict between open-source AI and large prestige companies. Such issues highlight the need for publicly available, copyright-free musical data, in which there is a large shortage, particularly for symbolic music data. To alleviate this issue, we present PDMX: a large-scale open-source dataset of over 250K public domain MusicXML scores collected from the score-sharing forum MuseScore, making it the largest available copyright-free symbolic music dataset to our knowledge. PDMX additionally includes a wealth of both tag and user interaction metadata, allowing us to efficiently analyze the dataset and filter for high quality user-generated scores. Given the additional metadata afforded by our data collection process, we conduct multitrack music generation experiments evaluating how different representative subsets of PDMX lead to different behaviors in downstream models, and how user-rating statistics can be used as an effective measure of data quality. Examples can be found at https://pnlong.github.io/PDMX.demo/.</description>

      <title>3DFacePolicy: Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation with Diffusion Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-driven 3D facial animation has made immersive progress both in research and application developments. The newest approaches focus on Transformer-based methods and diffusion-based methods, however, there is still gap in the vividness and emotional expression between the generated animation and real human face. To tackle this limitation, we propose 3DFacePolicy, a diffusion policy model for 3D facial animation prediction. This method generates variable and realistic human facial movements by predicting the 3D vertex trajectory on the 3D facial template with diffusion policy instead of facial generation for every frame. It takes audio and vertex states as observations to predict the vertex trajectory and imitate real human facial expressions, which keeps the continuous and natural flow of human emotions. The experiments show that our approach is effective in variable and dynamic facial motion synthesizing.</description>

      <title>SIFToM: Robust Spoken Instruction Following through Theory of Mind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spoken language instructions are ubiquitous in agent collaboration. However, in human-robot collaboration, recognition accuracy for human speech is often influenced by various speech and environmental factors, such as background noise, the speaker's accents, and mispronunciation. When faced with noisy or unfamiliar auditory inputs, humans use context and prior knowledge to disambiguate the stimulus and take pragmatic actions, a process referred to as top-down processing in cognitive science. We present a cognitively inspired model, Speech Instruction Following through Theory of Mind (SIFToM), to enable robots to pragmatically follow human instructions under diverse speech conditions by inferring the human's goal and joint plan as prior for speech perception and understanding. We test SIFToM in simulated home experiments (VirtualHome 2). Results show that the SIFToM model outperforms state-of-the-art speech and language models, approaching human-level accuracy on challenging speech instruction following tasks. We then demonstrate its ability at the task planning level on a mobile manipulator for breakfast preparation tasks.</description>

      <title>Shaking the Fake: Detecting Deepfake Videos in Real Time via Active Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time deepfake, a type of generative AI, is capable of "creating" non-existing contents (e.g., swapping one's face with another) in a video. It has been, very unfortunately, misused to produce deepfake videos (during web conferences, video calls, and identity authentication) for malicious purposes, including financial scams and political misinformation. Deepfake detection, as the countermeasure against deepfake, has attracted considerable attention from the academic community, yet existing works typically rely on learning passive features that may perform poorly beyond seen datasets. In this paper, we propose SFake, a new real-time deepfake detection method that innovatively exploits deepfake models' inability to adapt to physical interference. Specifically, SFake actively sends probes to trigger mechanical vibrations on the smartphone, resulting in the controllable feature on the footage. Consequently, SFake determines whether the face is swapped by deepfake based on the consistency of the facial area with the probe pattern. We implement SFake, evaluate its effectiveness on a self-built dataset, and compare it with six other detection methods. The results show that SFake outperforms other detection methods with higher detection accuracy, faster process speed, and lower memory consumption.</description>

      <title>WaterQualityNeT: Prediction of Seasonal Water Quality of Nepal Using Hybrid Deep Learning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring a safe and uncontaminated water supply is contingent upon the monitoring of water quality, especially in developing countries such as Nepal, where water sources are susceptible to pollution. This paper presents a hybrid deep learning model for predicting Nepal's seasonal water quality using a small dataset with many water quality parameters. The model integrates convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) to exploit temporal and spatial patterns in the data. The results demonstrate significant improvements in forecast accuracy over traditional methods, providing a reliable tool for proactive control of water quality. The model that used WQI parameters to classify people into good, poor, and average groups performed 92% of the time in testing. Similarly, the R2 score was 0.97 and the root mean square error was 2.87 when predicting WQI values using regression analysis. Additionally, a multifunctional application that uses both a regression and a classification approach is built to predict WQI values.</description>

      <title>GenCRF: Generative Clustering and Reformulation Framework for Enhanced Intent-Driven Information Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Query reformulation is a well-known problem in Information Retrieval (IR) aimed at enhancing single search successful completion rate by automatically modifying user's input query. Recent methods leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve query reformulation, but often generate limited and redundant expansions, potentially constraining their effectiveness in capturing diverse intents. In this paper, we propose GenCRF: a Generative Clustering and Reformulation Framework to capture diverse intentions adaptively based on multiple differentiated, well-generated queries in the retrieval phase for the first time. GenCRF leverages LLMs to generate variable queries from the initial query using customized prompts, then clusters them into groups to distinctly represent diverse intents. Furthermore, the framework explores to combine diverse intents query with innovative weighted aggregation strategies to optimize retrieval performance and crucially integrates a novel Query Evaluation Rewarding Model (QERM) to refine the process through feedback loops. Empirical experiments on the BEIR benchmark demonstrate that GenCRF achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous query reformulation SOTAs by up to 12% on nDCG@10. These techniques can be adapted to various LLMs, significantly boosting retriever performance and advancing the field of Information Retrieval.</description>

      <title>KALE: An Artwork Image Captioning System Augmented with Heterogeneous Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring the narratives conveyed by fine-art paintings is a challenge in image captioning, where the goal is to generate descriptions that not only precisely represent the visual content but also offer a in-depth interpretation of the artwork's meaning. The task is particularly complex for artwork images due to their diverse interpretations and varied aesthetic principles across different artistic schools and styles. In response to this, we present KALE Knowledge-Augmented vision-Language model for artwork Elaborations), a novel approach that enhances existing vision-language models by integrating artwork metadata as additional knowledge. KALE incorporates the metadata in two ways: firstly as direct textual input, and secondly through a multimodal heterogeneous knowledge graph. To optimize the learning of graph representations, we introduce a new cross-modal alignment loss that maximizes the similarity between the image and its corresponding metadata. Experimental results demonstrate that KALE achieves strong performance (when evaluated with CIDEr, in particular) over existing state-of-the-art work across several artwork datasets. Source code of the project is available at https://github.com/Yanbei-Jiang/Artwork-Interpretation.</description>

      <title>Early Detection of Coronary Heart Disease Using Hybrid Quantum Machine Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a severe cardiac disease, and hence, its early diagnosis is essential as it improves treatment results and saves money on medical care. The prevailing development of quantum computing and machine learning (ML) technologies may bring practical improvement to the performance of CHD diagnosis. Quantum machine learning (QML) is receiving tremendous interest in various disciplines due to its higher performance and capabilities. A quantum leap in the healthcare industry will increase processing power and optimise multiple models. Techniques for QML have the potential to forecast cardiac disease and help in early detection. To predict the risk of coronary heart disease, a hybrid approach utilizing an ensemble machine learning model based on QML classifiers is presented in this paper. Our approach, with its unique ability to address multidimensional healthcare data, reassures the method's robustness by fusing quantum and classical ML algorithms in a multi-step inferential framework. The marked rise in heart disease and death rates impacts worldwide human health and the global economy. Reducing cardiac morbidity and mortality requires early detection of heart disease. In this research, a hybrid approach utilizes techniques with quantum computing capabilities to tackle complex problems that are not amenable to conventional machine learning algorithms and to minimize computational expenses. The proposed method has been developed in the Raspberry Pi 5 Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) platform and tested on a broad dataset that integrates clinical and imaging data from patients suffering from CHD and healthy controls. Compared to classical machine learning models, the accuracy, sensitivity, F1 score, and specificity of the proposed hybrid QML model used with CHD are manifold higher.</description>

      <title>Contrasformer: A Brain Network Contrastive Transformer for Neurodegenerative Condition Identification</title>

Abstract: Understanding neurological disorder is a fundamental problem in neuroscience, which often requires the analysis of brain networks derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Despite the prevalence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers in various domains, applying them to brain networks faces challenges. Specifically, the datasets are severely impacted by the noises caused by distribution shifts across sub-populations and the neglect of node identities, both obstruct the identification of disease-specific patterns. To tackle these challenges, we propose Contrasformer, a novel contrastive brain network Transformer. It generates a prior-knowledge-enhanced contrast graph to address the distribution shifts across sub-populations by a two-stream attention mechanism. A cross attention with identity embedding highlights the identity of nodes, and three auxiliary losses ensure group consistency. Evaluated on 4 functional brain network datasets over 4 different diseases, Contrasformer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for brain networks by achieving up to 10.8\% improvement in accuracy, which demonstrates its efficacy in neurological disorder identification. Case studies illustrate its interpretability, especially in the context of neuroscience.

      <title>Investigating Context-Faithfulness in Large Language Models: The Roles of Memory Strength and Evidence Style</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external information into the response generation process. However, how context-faithful LLMs are and what factors influence LLMs' context-faithfulness remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the impact of memory strength and evidence presentation on LLMs' receptiveness to external evidence. We introduce a method to quantify the memory strength of LLMs by measuring the divergence in LLMs' responses to different paraphrases of the same question, which is not considered by previous works. We also generate evidence in various styles to evaluate the effects of evidence in different styles. Two datasets are used for evaluation: Natural Questions (NQ) with popular questions and popQA featuring long-tail questions. Our results show that for questions with high memory strength, LLMs are more likely to rely on internal memory, particularly for larger LLMs such as GPT-4. On the other hand, presenting paraphrased evidence significantly increases LLMs' receptiveness compared to simple repetition or adding details.</description>

      <title>Versatile Incremental Learning: Towards Class and Domain-Agnostic Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) aims to accumulate knowledge from sequential input tasks while overcoming catastrophic forgetting. Existing IL methods typically assume that an incoming task has only increments of classes or domains, referred to as Class IL (CIL) or Domain IL (DIL), respectively. In this work, we consider a more challenging and realistic but under-explored IL scenario, named Versatile Incremental Learning (VIL), in which a model has no prior of which of the classes or domains will increase in the next task. In the proposed VIL scenario, the model faces intra-class domain confusion and inter-domain class confusion, which makes the model fail to accumulate new knowledge without interference with learned knowledge. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective IL framework, named Incremental Classifier with Adaptation Shift cONtrol (ICON). Based on shifts of learnable modules, we design a novel regularization method called Cluster-based Adaptation Shift conTrol (CAST) to control the model to avoid confusion with the previously learned knowledge and thereby accumulate the new knowledge more effectively. Moreover, we introduce an Incremental Classifier (IC) which expands its output nodes to address the overwriting issue from different domains corresponding to a single class while maintaining the previous knowledge. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmarks, showcasing the effectiveness of our method across all the scenarios, particularly in cases where the next task can be randomly altered. Our implementation code is available at https://github.com/KHU-AGI/VIL.</description>

      <title>Active learning for energy-based antibody optimization and enhanced screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction and optimization of protein-protein binding affinity is crucial for therapeutic antibody development. Although machine learning-based prediction methods $\Delta\Delta G$ are suitable for large-scale mutant screening, they struggle to predict the effects of multiple mutations for targets without existing binders. Energy function-based methods, though more accurate, are time consuming and not ideal for large-scale screening. To address this, we propose an active learning workflow that efficiently trains a deep learning model to learn energy functions for specific targets, combining the advantages of both approaches. Our method integrates the RDE-Network deep learning model with Rosetta's energy function-based Flex ddG to efficiently explore mutants that bind to Flex ddG. In a case study targeting HER2-binding Trastuzumab mutants, our approach significantly improved the screening performance over random selection and demonstrated the ability to identify mutants with better binding properties without experimental $\Delta\Delta G$ data. This workflow advances computational antibody design by combining machine learning, physics-based computations, and active learning to achieve more efficient antibody development.</description>

      <title>Control-flow Reconstruction Attacks on Business Process Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Process models may be automatically generated from event logs that contain as-is data of a business process. While such models generalize over the control-flow of specific, recorded process executions, they are often also annotated with behavioural statistics, such as execution frequencies.Based thereon, once a model is published, certain insights about the original process executions may be reconstructed, so that an external party may extract confidential information about the business process. This work is the first to empirically investigate such reconstruction attempts based on process models. To this end, we propose different play-out strategies that reconstruct the control-flow from process trees, potentially exploiting frequency annotations. To assess the potential success of such reconstruction attacks on process models, and hence the risks imposed by publishing them, we compare the reconstructed process executions with those of the original log for several real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>GOSt-MT: A Knowledge Graph for Occupation-related Gender Biases in Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gender bias in machine translation (MT) systems poses significant challenges that often result in the reinforcement of harmful stereotypes. Especially in the labour domain where frequently occupations are inaccurately associated with specific genders, such biases perpetuate traditional gender stereotypes with a significant impact on society. Addressing these issues is crucial for ensuring equitable and accurate MT systems. This paper introduces a novel approach to studying occupation-related gender bias through the creation of the GOSt-MT (Gender and Occupation Statistics for Machine Translation) Knowledge Graph. GOSt-MT integrates comprehensive gender statistics from real-world labour data and textual corpora used in MT training. This Knowledge Graph allows for a detailed analysis of gender bias across English, French, and Greek, facilitating the identification of persistent stereotypes and areas requiring intervention. By providing a structured framework for understanding how occupations are gendered in both labour markets and MT systems, GOSt-MT contributes to efforts aimed at making MT systems more equitable and reducing gender biases in automated translations.</description>

      <title>Less is More: A Simple yet Effective Token Reduction Method for Efficient Multi-modal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has led to remarkable performances across various domains. However, this progress is accompanied by a substantial surge in the resource consumption of these models. We address this pressing issue by introducing a new approach, Token Reduction using CLIP Metric (TRIM), aimed at improving the efficiency of MLLMs without sacrificing their performance. Inspired by human attention patterns in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, TRIM presents a fresh perspective on the selection and reduction of image tokens. The TRIM method has been extensively tested across 12 datasets, and the results demonstrate a significant reduction in computational overhead while maintaining a consistent level of performance. This research marks a critical stride in efficient MLLM development, promoting greater accessibility and sustainability of high-performing models.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Low-Resource Language and Instruction Following Capabilities of Audio Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio language models can understand audio inputs and perform a range of audio-related tasks based on instructions, such as speech recognition and audio captioning, where the instructions are usually textual prompts. Audio language models are mostly initialized from pre-trained audio encoders and large language models (LLMs). Although these pre-trained components were developed to support multiple languages, audio-language models are trained predominantly on English data, which may limit their usability to only English instructions or English speech inputs. First, this paper examines the performance of existing audio language models in an underserved language using Thai as an example. This paper demonstrates that, despite being built on multilingual backbones, audio language models do not exhibit cross-lingual emergent abilities to low-resource languages. Second, this paper studies data mixture for developing audio language models that are optimized for a target language as well as English. In addition. this paper integrates audio comprehension and speech instruction-following capabilities into a single unified model. Our experiments provide insights into data mixture for enhancing instruction-following capabilities in both a low-resource language and English. Our model, Typhoon-Audio, outperforms existing open-source audio language models by a considerable margin, and it is comparable to state-of-the-art Gemini-1.5-Pro in both English and Thai languages.</description>

      <title>Single-stage TTS with Masked Audio Token Modeling and Semantic Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio token modeling has become a powerful framework for speech synthesis, with two-stage approaches employing semantic tokens remaining prevalent. In this paper, we aim to simplify this process by introducing a semantic knowledge distillation method that enables high-quality speech generation in a single stage. Our proposed model improves speech quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity compared to a single-stage baseline. Although two-stage systems still lead in intelligibility, our model significantly narrows the gap while delivering comparable speech quality. These findings showcase the potential of single-stage models to achieve efficient, high-quality TTS with a more compact and streamlined architecture.</description>

      <title>Enhanced segmentation of femoral bone metastasis in CT scans of patients using synthetic data generation with 3D diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Bone metastasis have a major impact on the quality of life of patients and they are diverse in terms of size and location, making their segmentation complex. Manual segmentation is time-consuming, and expert segmentations are subject to operator variability, which makes obtaining accurate and reproducible segmentations of bone metastasis on CT-scans a challenging yet important task to achieve. Materials and Methods: Deep learning methods tackle segmentation tasks efficiently but require large datasets along with expert manual segmentations to generalize on new images. We propose an automated data synthesis pipeline using 3D Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) to enchance the segmentation of femoral metastasis from CT-scan volumes of patients. We used 29 existing lesions along with 26 healthy femurs to create new realistic synthetic metastatic images, and trained a DDPM to improve the diversity and realism of the simulated volumes. We also investigated the operator variability on manual segmentation. Results: We created 5675 new volumes, then trained 3D U-Net segmentation models on real and synthetic data to compare segmentation performance, and we evaluated the performance of the models depending on the amount of synthetic data used in training. Conclusion: Our results showed that segmentation models trained with synthetic data outperformed those trained on real volumes only, and that those models perform especially well when considering operator variability.</description>

      <title>GEIC: Universal and Multilingual Named Entity Recognition with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have supplanted traditional methods in numerous natural language processing tasks. Nonetheless, in Named Entity Recognition (NER), existing LLM-based methods underperform compared to baselines and require significantly more computational resources, limiting their application. In this paper, we introduce the task of generation-based extraction and in-context classification (GEIC), designed to leverage LLMs' prior knowledge and self-attention mechanisms for NER tasks. We then propose CascadeNER, a universal and multilingual GEIC framework for few-shot and zero-shot NER. CascadeNER employs model cascading to utilize two small-parameter LLMs to extract and classify independently, reducing resource consumption while enhancing accuracy. We also introduce AnythingNER, the first NER dataset specifically designed for LLMs, including 8 languages, 155 entity types and a novel dynamic categorization system. Experiments show that CascadeNER achieves state-of-the-art performance on low-resource and fine-grained scenarios, including CrossNER and FewNERD. Our work is openly accessible.</description>

      <title>D2Vformer: A Flexible Time Series Prediction Model Based on Time Position Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time position embeddings capture the positional information of time steps, often serving as auxiliary inputs to enhance the predictive capabilities of time series models. However, existing models exhibit limitations in capturing intricate time positional information and effectively utilizing these embeddings. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel model called D2Vformer. Unlike typical prediction methods that rely on RNNs or Transformers, this approach can directly handle scenarios where the predicted sequence is not adjacent to the input sequence or where its length dynamically changes. In comparison to conventional methods, D2Vformer undoubtedly saves a significant amount of training resources. In D2Vformer, the Date2Vec module uses the timestamp information and feature sequences to generate time position embeddings. Afterward, D2Vformer introduces a new fusion block that utilizes an attention mechanism to explore the similarity in time positions between the embeddings of the input sequence and the predicted sequence, thereby generating predictions based on this similarity. Through extensive experiments on six datasets, we demonstrate that Date2Vec outperforms other time position embedding methods, and D2Vformer surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both fixed-length and variable-length prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>A logical alarm for misaligned binary classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If two agents disagree in their decisions, we may suspect they are not both correct. This intuition is formalized for evaluating agents that have carried out a binary classification task. Their agreements and disagreements on a joint test allow us to establish the only group evaluations logically consistent with their responses. This is done by establishing a set of axioms (algebraic relations) that must be universally obeyed by all evaluations of binary responders. A complete set of such axioms are possible for each ensemble of size N. The axioms for $N = 1, 2$ are used to construct a fully logical alarm - one that can prove that at least one ensemble member is malfunctioning using only unlabeled data. The similarities of this approach to formal software verification and its utility for recent agendas of safe guaranteed AI are discussed.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Evaluation of Quantized Instruction-Tuned Large Language Models: An Experimental Analysis up to 405B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prior research works have evaluated quantized LLMs using limited metrics such as perplexity or a few basic knowledge tasks and old datasets. Additionally, recent large-scale models such as Llama 3.1 with up to 405B have not been thoroughly examined. This paper evaluates the performance of instruction-tuned LLMs across various quantization methods (GPTQ, AWQ, SmoothQuant, and FP8) on models ranging from 7B to 405B. Using 13 benchmarks, we assess performance across six task types: commonsense Q\&amp;A, knowledge and language understanding, instruction following, hallucination detection, mathematics, and dialogue. Our key findings reveal that (1) quantizing a larger LLM to a similar size as a smaller FP16 LLM generally performs better across most benchmarks, except for hallucination detection and instruction following; (2) performance varies significantly with different quantization methods, model size, and bit-width, with weight-only methods often yielding better results in larger models; (3) task difficulty does not significantly impact accuracy degradation due to quantization; and (4) the MT-Bench evaluation method has limited discriminatory power among recent high-performing LLMs.</description>

      <title>Improve Machine Learning carbon footprint using Parquet dataset format and Mixed Precision training for regression algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study was the 2nd part of my dissertation for my master degree and compared the power consumption using the Comma-Separated-Values (CSV) and parquet dataset format with the default floating point (32bit) and Nvidia mixed precision (16bit and 32bit) while training a regression ML model. The same custom PC as per the 1st part, which was dedicated to the classification testing and analysis, was built to perform the experiments, and different ML hyper-parameters, such as batch size, neurons, and epochs, were chosen to build Deep Neural Networks (DNN). A benchmarking test with default hyper-parameter values for the DNN was used as a reference, while the experiments used a combination of different settings. The results were recorded in Excel, and descriptive statistics were chosen to calculate the mean between the groups and compare them using graphs and tables. The outcome was positive when using mixed precision combined with specific hyper-parameters. Compared to the benchmarking, optimising the regression models reduced the power consumption between 7 and 11 Watts. The regression results show that while mixed precision can help improve power consumption, we must carefully consider the hyper-parameters. A high number of batch sizes and neurons will negatively affect power consumption. However, this research required inferential statistics, specifically ANOVA and T-test, to compare the relationship between the means. The results reported no statistical significance between the means in the regression tests and accepted H0. Therefore, choosing different ML techniques and the Parquet dataset format will not improve the computational power consumption and the overall ML carbon footprint. However, a more extensive implementation with a cluster of GPUs can increase the sample size significantly, as it is an essential factor and can change the outcome of the statistical analysis.</description>

Abstract: Mathematics has long been conveyed through natural language, primarily for human understanding. With the rise of mechanized mathematics and proof assistants, there is a growing need to understand informal mathematical text, yet most existing benchmarks focus solely on English, overlooking other languages. This paper introduces RoMath, a Romanian mathematical reasoning benchmark suite comprising three datasets: RoMath-Baccalaureate, RoMath-Competitions and RoMath-Synthetic, which cover a range of mathematical domains and difficulty levels, aiming to improve non-English language models and promote multilingual AI development. By focusing on Romanian, a low-resource language with unique linguistic features, RoMath addresses the limitations of Anglo-centric models and emphasizes the need for dedicated resources beyond simple automatic translation. We benchmark several open-weight language models, highlighting the importance of creating resources for underrepresented languages. We make the code and dataset available.</description>

      <title>MonoKAN: Certified Monotonic Kolmogorov-Arnold Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have significantly advanced various fields by effectively recognizing patterns and solving complex problems. Despite these advancements, their interpretability remains a critical challenge, especially in applications where transparency and accountability are essential. To address this, explainable AI (XAI) has made progress in demystifying ANNs, yet interpretability alone is often insufficient. In certain applications, model predictions must align with expert-imposed requirements, sometimes exemplified by partial monotonicity constraints. While monotonic approaches are found in the literature for traditional Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs), they still face difficulties in achieving both interpretability and certified partial monotonicity. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture, based on learnable activation functions parametrized as splines, has been proposed as a more interpretable alternative to MLPs. Building on this, we introduce a novel ANN architecture called MonoKAN, which is based on the KAN architecture and achieves certified partial monotonicity while enhancing interpretability. To achieve this, we employ cubic Hermite splines, which guarantee monotonicity through a set of straightforward conditions. Additionally, by using positive weights in the linear combinations of these splines, we ensure that the network preserves the monotonic relationships between input and output. Our experiments demonstrate that MonoKAN not only enhances interpretability but also improves predictive performance across the majority of benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art monotonic MLP approaches.</description>

      <title>Diversity-grounded Channel Prototypical Learning for Out-of-Distribution Intent Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of task-oriented dialogue systems, a robust intent detection mechanism must effectively handle malformed utterances encountered in real-world scenarios. This study presents a novel fine-tuning framework for large language models (LLMs) aimed at enhancing in-distribution (ID) intent classification and out-of-distribution (OOD) intent detection, which utilizes semantic matching with prototypes derived from ID class names. By harnessing the highly distinguishable representations of LLMs, we construct semantic prototypes for each ID class using a diversity-grounded prompt tuning approach. We rigorously test our framework in a challenging OOD context, where ID and OOD classes are semantically close yet distinct, referred to as \emph{near} OOD detection. For a thorough assessment, we benchmark our method against the prevalent fine-tuning approaches. The experimental findings reveal that our method demonstrates superior performance in both few-shot ID intent classification and near-OOD intent detection tasks.</description>

      <title>Learning Generalized Hamiltonians using fully Symplectic Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many important physical systems can be described as the evolution of a Hamiltonian system, which has the important property of being conservative, that is, energy is conserved throughout the evolution. Physics Informed Neural Networks and in particular Hamiltonian Neural Networks have emerged as a mechanism to incorporate structural inductive bias into the NN model. By ensuring physical invariances are conserved, the models exhibit significantly better sample complexity and out-of-distribution accuracy than standard NNs. Learning the Hamiltonian as a function of its canonical variables, typically position and velocity, from sample observations of the system thus becomes a critical task in system identification and long-term prediction of system behavior. However, to truly preserve the long-run physical conservation properties of Hamiltonian systems, one must use symplectic integrators for a forward pass of the system's simulation. While symplectic schemes have been used in the literature, they are thus far limited to situations when they reduce to explicit algorithms, which include the case of separable Hamiltonians or augmented non-separable Hamiltonians. We extend it to generalized non-separable Hamiltonians, and noting the self-adjoint property of symplectic integrators, we bypass computationally intensive backpropagation through an ODE solver. We show that the method is robust to noise and provides a good approximation of the system Hamiltonian when the state variables are sampled from a noisy observation. In the numerical results, we show the performance of the method concerning Hamiltonian reconstruction and conservation, indicating its particular advantage for non-separable systems.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Speech Restoration with Latent Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional speech enhancement methods often oversimplify the task of restoration by focusing on a single type of distortion. Generative models that handle multiple distortions frequently struggle with phone reconstruction and high-frequency harmonics, leading to breathing and gasping artifacts that reduce the intelligibility of reconstructed speech. These models are also computationally demanding, and many solutions are restricted to producing outputs in the wide-band frequency range, which limits their suitability for professional applications. To address these challenges, we propose Hi-ResLDM, a novel generative model based on latent diffusion designed to remove multiple distortions and restore speech recordings to studio quality, sampled at 48kHz. We benchmark Hi-ResLDM against state-of-the-art methods that leverage GAN and Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) components, demonstrating superior performance in regenerating high-frequency-band details. Hi-ResLDM not only excels in non-instrusive metrics but is also consistently preferred in human evaluation and performs competitively on intrusive evaluations, making it ideal for high-resolution speech restoration.</description>

      <title>Improving the Efficiency of Visually Augmented Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of autoregressive Language Models (LM) it has been shown that due to reporting bias, LMs lack visual knowledge, i.e. they do not know much about the visual world and its properties. To augment LMs with visual knowledge, existing solutions often rely on explicit images, requiring time-consuming retrieval or image generation systems. This paper shows that explicit images are not necessary to visually augment an LM. Instead, we use visually-grounded text representations obtained from the well-known CLIP multimodal system. For a fair comparison, we modify VALM, a visually-augmented LM which uses image retrieval and representation, to work directly with visually-grounded text representations. We name this new model BLIND-VALM. We show that BLIND-VALM performs on par with VALM for Visual Language Understanding (VLU), Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Language Modeling tasks, despite being significantly more efficient and simpler. We also show that scaling up our model within the compute budget of VALM, either increasing the model or pre-training corpus size, we outperform VALM for all the evaluation tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical imaging analysis faces challenges such as data scarcity, high annotation costs, and privacy concerns. This paper introduces the Medical AI for Synthetic Imaging (MAISI), an innovative approach using the diffusion model to generate synthetic 3D computed tomography (CT) images to address those challenges. MAISI leverages the foundation volume compression network and the latent diffusion model to produce high-resolution CT images (up to a landmark volume dimension of 512 x 512 x 768 ) with flexible volume dimensions and voxel spacing. By incorporating ControlNet, MAISI can process organ segmentation, including 127 anatomical structures, as additional conditions and enables the generation of accurately annotated synthetic images that can be used for various downstream tasks. Our experiment results show that MAISI's capabilities in generating realistic, anatomically accurate images for diverse regions and conditions reveal its promising potential to mitigate challenges using synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Identifying Influential nodes in Brain Networks via Self-Supervised Graph-Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying influential nodes (I-nodes) in brain networks is of great significance in the field of brain imaging. Most existing studies consider brain connectivity hubs as I-nodes. However, this approach relies heavily on prior knowledge from graph theory, which may overlook the intrinsic characteristics of the brain network, especially when its architecture is not fully understood. In contrast, self-supervised deep learning can learn meaningful representations directly from the data. This approach enables the exploration of I-nodes for brain networks, which is also lacking in current studies. This paper proposes a Self-Supervised Graph Reconstruction framework based on Graph-Transformer (SSGR-GT) to identify I-nodes, which has three main characteristics. First, as a self-supervised model, SSGR-GT extracts the importance of brain nodes to the reconstruction. Second, SSGR-GT uses Graph-Transformer, which is well-suited for extracting features from brain graphs, combining both local and global characteristics. Third, multimodal analysis of I-nodes uses graph-based fusion technology, combining functional and structural brain information. The I-nodes we obtained are distributed in critical areas such as the superior frontal lobe, lateral parietal lobe, and lateral occipital lobe, with a total of 56 identified across different experiments. These I-nodes are involved in more brain networks than other regions, have longer fiber connections, and occupy more central positions in structural connectivity. They also exhibit strong connectivity and high node efficiency in both functional and structural networks. Furthermore, there is a significant overlap between the I-nodes and both the structural and functional rich-club. These findings enhance our understanding of the I-nodes within the brain network, and provide new insights for future research in further understanding the brain working mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning tools to support deforestation monitoring in the Ivory Coast using SAR and Optical satellite imagery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deforestation is gaining an increasingly importance due to its strong influence on the sorrounding environment, especially in developing countries where population has a disadvantaged economic condition and agriculture is the main source of income. In Ivory Coast, for instance, where the cocoa production is the most remunerative activity, it is not rare to assist to the replacement of portion of ancient forests with new cocoa plantations. In order to monitor this type of deleterious activities, satellites can be employed to recognize the disappearance of the forest to prevent it from expand its area of interest. In this study, Forest-Non-Forest map (FNF) has been used as ground truth for models based on Sentinel images input. State-of-the-art models U-Net, Attention U-Net, Segnet and FCN32 are compared over different years combining Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and cloud probability to create forest/non-forest segmentation. Although Ivory Coast lacks of forest coverage datasets and is partially covered by Sentinel images, it is demonstrated the feasibility to create models classifying forest and non-forests pixels over the area using open datasets to predict where deforestation could have occurred. Although a significant portion of the deforestation research is carried out on visible bands, SAR acquisitions are employed to overcome the limits of RGB images over areas often covered by clouds. Finally, the most promising model is employed to estimate the hectares of forest has been cut between 2019 and 2020.</description>

      <title>SuperCoder2.0: Technical Report on Exploring the feasibility of LLMs as Autonomous Programmer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SuperCoder2.0, an advanced autonomous system designed to enhance software development through artificial intelligence. The system combines an AI-native development approach with intelligent agents to enable fully autonomous coding. Key focus areas include a retry mechanism with error output traceback, comprehensive code rewriting and replacement using Abstract Syntax Tree (ast) parsing to minimize linting issues, code embedding technique for retrieval-augmented generation, and a focus on localizing methods for problem-solving rather than identifying specific line numbers. The methodology employs a three-step hierarchical search space reduction approach for code base navigation and bug localization:utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and a Repository File Level Map to identify candidate files, (2) narrowing down to the most relevant files using a File Level Schematic Map, and (3) extracting 'relevant locations' within these files. Code editing is performed through a two-part module comprising CodeGeneration and CodeEditing, which generates multiple solutions at different temperature values and replaces entire methods or classes to maintain code integrity. A feedback loop executes repository-level test cases to validate and refine solutions. Experiments conducted on the SWE-bench Lite dataset demonstrate SuperCoder2.0's effectiveness, achieving correct file localization in 84.33% of cases within the top 5 candidates and successfully resolving 34% of test instances. This performance places SuperCoder2.0 fourth globally on the SWE-bench leaderboard. The system's ability to handle diverse repositories and problem types highlights its potential as a versatile tool for autonomous software development. Future work will focus on refining the code editing process and exploring advanced embedding models for improved natural language to code mapping.</description>

Abstract: One application area of long-term memory (LTM) capabilities with increasing traction is personal AI companions and assistants. With the ability to retain and contextualize past interactions and adapt to user preferences, personal AI companions and assistants promise a profound shift in how we interact with AI and are on track to become indispensable in personal and professional settings. However, this advancement introduces new challenges and vulnerabilities that require careful consideration regarding the deployment and widespread use of these systems. The goal of this paper is to explore the broader implications of building and deploying personal AI applications with LTM capabilities using a holistic evaluation approach. This will be done in three ways: 1) reviewing the technological underpinnings of LTM in Large Language Models, 2) surveying current personal AI companions and assistants, and 3) analyzing critical considerations and implications of deploying and using these applications.</description>

      <title>SDP: Spiking Diffusion Policy for Robotic Manipulation with Learnable Channel-Wise Membrane Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Spiking Diffusion Policy (SDP) learning method for robotic manipulation by integrating Spiking Neurons and Learnable Channel-wise Membrane Thresholds (LCMT) into the diffusion policy model, thereby enhancing computational efficiency and achieving high performance in evaluated tasks. Specifically, the proposed SDP model employs the U-Net architecture as the backbone for diffusion learning within the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). It strategically places residual connections between the spike convolution operations and the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) nodes, thereby preventing disruptions to the spiking states. Additionally, we introduce a temporal encoding block and a temporal decoding block to transform static and dynamic data with timestep $T_S$ into each other, enabling the transmission of data within the SNN in spike format. Furthermore, we propose LCMT to enable the adaptive acquisition of membrane potential thresholds, thereby matching the conditions of varying membrane potentials and firing rates across channels and avoiding the cumbersome process of manually setting and tuning hyperparameters. Evaluating the SDP model on seven distinct tasks with SNN timestep $T_S=4$, we achieve results comparable to those of the ANN counterparts, along with faster convergence speeds than the baseline SNN method. This improvement is accompanied by a reduction of 94.3\% in dynamic energy consumption estimated on 45nm hardware.</description>

      <title>Learning Source Disentanglement in Neural Audio Codec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural audio codecs have significantly advanced audio compression by efficiently converting continuous audio signals into discrete tokens. These codecs preserve high-quality sound and enable sophisticated sound generation through generative models trained on these tokens. However, existing neural codec models are typically trained on large, undifferentiated audio datasets, neglecting the essential discrepancies between sound domains like speech, music, and environmental sound effects. This oversight complicates data modeling and poses additional challenges to the controllability of sound generation. To tackle these issues, we introduce the Source-Disentangled Neural Audio Codec (SD-Codec), a novel approach that combines audio coding and source separation. By jointly learning audio resynthesis and separation, SD-Codec explicitly assigns audio signals from different domains to distinct codebooks, sets of discrete representations. Experimental results indicate that SD-Codec not only maintains competitive resynthesis quality but also, supported by the separation results, demonstrates successful disentanglement of different sources in the latent space, thereby enhancing interpretability in audio codec and providing potential finer control over the audio generation process.</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript I present an analysis on the performance of OpenAI O1-preview model in solving random K-SAT instances for K$\in {2,3,4}$ as a function of $\alpha=M/N$ where $M$ is the number of clauses and $N$ is the number of variables of the satisfiable problem. I show that the model can call an external SAT solver to solve the instances, rather than solving them directly. Despite using external solvers, the model reports incorrect assignments as output. Moreover, I propose and present an analysis to quantify whether the OpenAI O1-preview model demonstrates a spark of intelligence or merely makes random guesses when outputting an assignment for a Boolean satisfiability problem.</description>

Abstract: Network slicing in 5G and the future 6G networks will enable the creation of multiple virtualized networks on a shared physical infrastructure. This innovative approach enables the provision of tailored networks to accommodate specific business types or industry users, thus delivering more customized and efficient services. However, the shared memory and cache in network slicing introduce security vulnerabilities that have yet to be fully addressed. In this paper, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based side-channel cache attack framework specifically designed for network slicing environments. Unlike traditional cache attack methods, our framework leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically identify and exploit cache locations storing sensitive information, such as authentication keys and user registration data. We assume that one slice network is compromised and demonstrate how the attacker can induce another shared slice to send registration requests, thereby estimating the cache locations of critical data. By formulating the cache timing channel attack as a reinforcement learning-driven guessing game between the attack slice and the victim slice, our model efficiently explores possible actions to pinpoint memory blocks containing sensitive information. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach, achieving a success rate of approximately 95\% to 98\% in accurately identifying the storage locations of sensitive data. This high level of accuracy underscores the potential risks in shared network slicing environments and highlights the need for robust security measures to safeguard against such advanced side-channel attacks.</description>

      <title>The Sounds of Home: A Speech-Removed Residential Audio Dataset for Sound Event Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a residential audio dataset to support sound event detection research for smart home applications aimed at promoting wellbeing for older adults. The dataset is constructed by deploying audio recording systems in the homes of 8 participants aged 55-80 years for a 7-day period. Acoustic characteristics are documented through detailed floor plans and construction material information to enable replication of the recording environments for AI model deployment. A novel automated speech removal pipeline is developed, using pre-trained audio neural networks to detect and remove segments containing spoken voice, while preserving segments containing other sound events. The resulting dataset consists of privacy-compliant audio recordings that accurately capture the soundscapes and activities of daily living within residential spaces. The paper details the dataset creation methodology, the speech removal pipeline utilizing cascaded model architectures, and an analysis of the vocal label distribution to validate the speech removal process. This dataset enables the development and benchmarking of sound event detection models tailored specifically for in-home applications.</description>

      <title>Integrating Reinforcement Learning and Model Predictive Control with Applications to Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes an approach that integrates reinforcement learning and model predictive control (MPC) to efficiently solve finite-horizon optimal control problems in mixed-logical dynamical systems. Optimization-based control of such systems with discrete and continuous decision variables entails the online solution of mixed-integer quadratic or linear programs, which suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Our approach aims at mitigating this issue by effectively decoupling the decision on the discrete variables and the decision on the continuous variables. Moreover, to mitigate the combinatorial growth in the number of possible actions due to the prediction horizon, we conceive the definition of decoupled Q-functions to make the learning problem more tractable. The use of reinforcement learning reduces the online optimization problem of the MPC controller from a mixed-integer linear (quadratic) program to a linear (quadratic) program, greatly reducing the computational time. Simulation experiments for a microgrid, based on real-world data, demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the online computation time of the MPC approach and that it generates policies with small optimality gaps and high feasibility rates.</description>

      <title>LOLA -- An Open-Source Massively Multilingual Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents LOLA, a massively multilingual large language model trained on more than 160 languages using a sparse Mixture-of-Experts Transformer architecture. Our architectural and implementation choices address the challenge of harnessing linguistic diversity while maintaining efficiency and avoiding the common pitfalls of multilinguality. Our analysis of the evaluation results shows competitive performance in natural language generation and understanding tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate how the learned expert-routing mechanism exploits implicit phylogenetic linguistic patterns to potentially alleviate the curse of multilinguality. We provide an in-depth look at the training process, an analysis of the datasets, and a balanced exploration of the model's strengths and limitations. As an open-source model, LOLA promotes reproducibility and serves as a robust foundation for future research. Our findings enable the development of compute-efficient multilingual models with strong, scalable performance across languages.</description>

      <title>Task Arithmetic for Language Expansion in Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have gained interest in speech-text multimodal foundation models, achieving strong performance on instruction-based speech translation (ST). However, expanding language pairs from an existing instruction-tuned ST system is costly due to the necessity of re-training on a combination of new and previous datasets. We propose to expand new language pairs by merging the model trained on new language pairs and the existing model, using task arithmetic. We find that the direct application of task arithmetic for ST causes the merged model to fail to follow instructions; thus, generating translation in incorrect languages. To eliminate language confusion, we propose an augmented task arithmetic method that merges an additional language control model. It is trained to generate the correct target language token following the instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed language control model can achieve language expansion by eliminating language confusion. In our MuST-C and CoVoST-2 experiments, it shows up to 4.66 and 4.92 BLEU scores improvement, respectively. In addition, we demonstrate the use of our task arithmetic framework can expand to a language pair where neither paired ST training data nor a pre-trained ST model is available. We first synthesize the ST system from machine translation (MT) systems via task analogy, then merge the synthesized ST system to the existing ST model.</description>

      <title>Zero-resource Hallucination Detection for Text Generation via Graph-based Contextual Knowledge Triples Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs obtain remarkable performance but suffer from hallucinations. Most research on detecting hallucination focuses on the questions with short and concrete correct answers that are easy to check the faithfulness. Hallucination detections for text generation with open-ended answers are more challenging. Some researchers use external knowledge to detect hallucinations in generated texts, but external resources for specific scenarios are hard to access. Recent studies on detecting hallucinations in long text without external resources conduct consistency comparison among multiple sampled outputs. To handle long texts, researchers split long texts into multiple facts and individually compare the consistency of each pairs of facts. However, these methods (1) hardly achieve alignment among multiple facts; (2) overlook dependencies between multiple contextual facts. In this paper, we propose a graph-based context-aware (GCA) hallucination detection for text generations, which aligns knowledge facts and considers the dependencies between contextual knowledge triples in consistency comparison. Particularly, to align multiple facts, we conduct a triple-oriented response segmentation to extract multiple knowledge triples. To model dependencies among contextual knowledge triple (facts), we construct contextual triple into a graph and enhance triples' interactions via message passing and aggregating via RGCN. To avoid the omission of knowledge triples in long text, we conduct a LLM-based reverse verification via reconstructing the knowledge triples. Experiments show that our model enhances hallucination detection and excels all baselines.</description>

      <title>EIA: Environmental Injection Attack on Generalist Web Agents for Privacy Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalist web agents have evolved rapidly and demonstrated remarkable potential. However, there are unprecedented safety risks associated with these them, which are nearly unexplored so far. In this work, we aim to narrow this gap by conducting the first study on the privacy risks of generalist web agents in adversarial environments. First, we present a threat model that discusses the adversarial targets, constraints, and attack scenarios. Particularly, we consider two types of adversarial targets: stealing users' specific personally identifiable information (PII) or stealing the entire user request. To achieve these objectives, we propose a novel attack method, termed Environmental Injection Attack (EIA). This attack injects malicious content designed to adapt well to different environments where the agents operate, causing them to perform unintended actions. This work instantiates EIA specifically for the privacy scenario. It inserts malicious web elements alongside persuasive instructions that mislead web agents into leaking private information, and can further leverage CSS and JavaScript features to remain stealthy. We collect 177 actions steps that involve diverse PII categories on realistic websites from the Mind2Web dataset, and conduct extensive experiments using one of the most capable generalist web agent frameworks to date, SeeAct. The results demonstrate that EIA achieves up to 70% ASR in stealing users' specific PII. Stealing full user requests is more challenging, but a relaxed version of EIA can still achieve 16% ASR. Despite these concerning results, it is important to note that the attack can still be detectable through careful human inspection, highlighting a trade-off between high autonomy and security. This leads to our detailed discussion on the efficacy of EIA under different levels of human supervision as well as implications on defenses for generalist web agents.</description>

      <title>TTT-Unet: Enhancing U-Net with Test-Time Training Layers for biomedical image segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is crucial for accurately diagnosing and analyzing various diseases. However, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, the most commonly used architectures for this task, struggle to effectively capture long-range dependencies due to the inherent locality of CNNs and the computational complexity of Transformers. To address this limitation, we introduce TTT-Unet, a novel framework that integrates Test-Time Training (TTT) layers into the traditional U-Net architecture for biomedical image segmentation. TTT-Unet dynamically adjusts model parameters during the testing time, enhancing the model's ability to capture both local and long-range features. We evaluate TTT-Unet on multiple medical imaging datasets, including 3D abdominal organ segmentation in CT and MR images, instrument segmentation in endoscopy images, and cell segmentation in microscopy images. The results demonstrate that TTT-Unet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CNN-based and Transformer-based segmentation models across all tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/rongzhou7/TTT-Unet.</description>

      <title>MSDNet: Multi-Scale Decoder for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation via Transformer-Guided Prototyping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-shot Semantic Segmentation addresses the challenge of segmenting objects in query images with only a handful of annotated examples. However, many previous state-of-the-art methods either have to discard intricate local semantic features or suffer from high computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a new Few-shot Semantic Segmentation framework based on the transformer architecture. Our approach introduces the spatial transformer decoder and the contextual mask generation module to improve the relational understanding between support and query images. Moreover, we introduce a multi-scale decoder to refine the segmentation mask by incorporating features from different resolutions in a hierarchical manner. Additionally, our approach integrates global features from intermediate encoder stages to improve contextual understanding, while maintaining a lightweight structure to reduce complexity. This balance between performance and efficiency enables our method to achieve state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets such as $PASCAL-5^i$ and $COCO-20^i$ in both 1-shot and 5-shot settings. Notably, our model with only 1.5 million parameters demonstrates competitive performance while overcoming limitations of existing methodologies. https://github.com/amirrezafateh/MSDNet</description>

      <title>SOAP: Improving and Stabilizing Shampoo using Adam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is growing evidence of the effectiveness of Shampoo, a higher-order preconditioning method, over Adam in deep learning optimization tasks. However, Shampoo's drawbacks include additional hyperparameters and computational overhead when compared to Adam, which only updates running averages of first- and second-moment quantities. This work establishes a formal connection between Shampoo (implemented with the 1/2 power) and Adafactor -- a memory-efficient approximation of Adam -- showing that Shampoo is equivalent to running Adafactor in the eigenbasis of Shampoo's preconditioner. This insight leads to the design of a simpler and computationally efficient algorithm: $\textbf{S}$hampo$\textbf{O}$ with $\textbf{A}$dam in the $\textbf{P}$reconditioner's eigenbasis (SOAP).
  With regards to improving Shampoo's computational efficiency, the most straightforward approach would be to simply compute Shampoo's eigendecomposition less frequently. Unfortunately, as our empirical results show, this leads to performance degradation that worsens with this frequency. SOAP mitigates this degradation by continually updating the running average of the second moment, just as Adam does, but in the current (slowly changing) coordinate basis. Furthermore, since SOAP is equivalent to running Adam in a rotated space, it introduces only one additional hyperparameter (the preconditioning frequency) compared to Adam. We empirically evaluate SOAP on language model pre-training with 360m and 660m sized models. In the large batch regime, SOAP reduces the number of iterations by over 40% and wall clock time by over 35% compared to AdamW, with approximately 20% improvements in both metrics compared to Shampoo. An implementation of SOAP is available at https://github.com/nikhilvyas/SOAP.</description>

      <title>OmniGen: Unified Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce OmniGen, a new diffusion model for unified image generation. Unlike popular diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion), OmniGen no longer requires additional modules such as ControlNet or IP-Adapter to process diverse control conditions. OmniGenis characterized by the following features: 1) Unification: OmniGen not only demonstrates text-to-image generation capabilities but also inherently supports other downstream tasks, such as image editing, subject-driven generation, and visual-conditional generation. Additionally, OmniGen can handle classical computer vision tasks by transforming them into image generation tasks, such as edge detection and human pose recognition. 2) Simplicity: The architecture of OmniGen is highly simplified, eliminating the need for additional text encoders. Moreover, it is more user-friendly compared to existing diffusion models, enabling complex tasks to be accomplished through instructions without the need for extra preprocessing steps (e.g., human pose estimation), thereby significantly simplifying the workflow of image generation. 3) Knowledge Transfer: Through learning in a unified format, OmniGen effectively transfers knowledge across different tasks, manages unseen tasks and domains, and exhibits novel capabilities. We also explore the model's reasoning capabilities and potential applications of chain-of-thought mechanism. This work represents the first attempt at a general-purpose image generation model, and there remain several unresolved issues. We will open-source the related resources at https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/OmniGen to foster advancements in this field.</description>

      <title>Clinical Validation of a Real-Time Machine Learning-based System for the Detection of Acute Myeloid Leukemia by Flow Cytometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) models in flow cytometry have the potential to reduce error rates, increase reproducibility, and boost the efficiency of clinical labs. While numerous ML models for flow cytometry data have been proposed, few studies have described the clinical deployment of such models. Realizing the potential gains of ML models in clinical labs requires not only an accurate model, but infrastructure for automated inference, error detection, analytics and monitoring, and structured data extraction. Here, we describe an ML model for detection of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), along with the infrastructure supporting clinical implementation. Our infrastructure leverages the resilience and scalability of the cloud for model inference, a Kubernetes-based workflow system that provides model reproducibility and resource management, and a system for extracting structured diagnoses from full-text reports. We also describe our model monitoring and visualization platform, an essential element for ensuring continued model accuracy. Finally, we present a post-deployment analysis of impacts on turn-around time and compare production accuracy to the original validation statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving with vision-only is not only more cost-effective compared to LiDAR-vision fusion but also more reliable than traditional methods. To achieve a economical and robust purely visual autonomous driving system, we propose RenderWorld, a vision-only end-to-end autonomous driving framework, which generates 3D occupancy labels using a self-supervised gaussian-based Img2Occ Module, then encodes the labels by AM-VAE, and uses world model for forecasting and planning. RenderWorld employs Gaussian Splatting to represent 3D scenes and render 2D images greatly improves segmentation accuracy and reduces GPU memory consumption compared with NeRF-based methods. By applying AM-VAE to encode air and non-air separately, RenderWorld achieves more fine-grained scene element representation, leading to state-of-the-art performance in both 4D occupancy forecasting and motion planning from autoregressive world model.</description>

      <title>AI Suggestions Homogenize Writing Toward Western Styles and Diminish Cultural Nuances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly integrated into everyday products and services, such as coding tools and writing assistants. As these embedded AI applications are deployed globally, there is a growing concern that the AI models underlying these applications prioritize Western values. This paper investigates what happens when a Western-centric AI model provides writing suggestions to users from a different cultural background. We conducted a cross-cultural controlled experiment with 118 participants from India and the United States who completed culturally grounded writing tasks with and without AI suggestions. Our analysis reveals that AI provided greater efficiency gains for Americans compared to Indians. Moreover, AI suggestions led Indian participants to adopt Western writing styles, altering not just what is written but also how it is written. These findings show that Western-centric AI models homogenize writing toward Western norms, diminishing nuances that differentiate cultural expression.</description>

Abstract: AI agents have the potential to aid users on a variety of consequential tasks, including conducting scientific research. To spur the development of useful agents, we need benchmarks that are challenging, but more crucially, directly correspond to real-world tasks of interest. This paper introduces such a benchmark, designed to measure the accuracy of AI agents in tackling a crucial yet surprisingly challenging aspect of scientific research: computational reproducibility. This task, fundamental to the scientific process, involves reproducing the results of a study using the provided code and data. We introduce CORE-Bench (Computational Reproducibility Agent Benchmark), a benchmark consisting of 270 tasks based on 90 scientific papers across three disciplines (computer science, social science, and medicine). Tasks in CORE-Bench consist of three difficulty levels and include both language-only and vision-language tasks. We provide an evaluation system to measure the accuracy of agents in a fast and parallelizable way, saving days of evaluation time for each run compared to a sequential implementation. We evaluated two baseline agents: the general-purpose AutoGPT and a task-specific agent called CORE-Agent. We tested both variants using two underlying language models: GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini. The best agent achieved an accuracy of 21% on the hardest task, showing the vast scope for improvement in automating routine scientific tasks. Having agents that can reproduce existing work is a necessary step towards building agents that can conduct novel research and could verify and improve the performance of other research agents. We hope that CORE-Bench can improve the state of reproducibility and spur the development of future research agents.</description>

      <title>Multi-OCT-SelfNet: Integrating Self-Supervised Learning with Multi-Source Data Fusion for Enhanced Multi-Class Retinal Disease Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the medical domain, acquiring large datasets poses significant challenges due to privacy concerns. Nonetheless, the development of a robust deep-learning model for retinal disease diagnosis necessitates a substantial dataset for training. The capacity to generalize effectively on smaller datasets remains a persistent challenge. The scarcity of data presents a significant barrier to the practical implementation of scalable medical AI solutions. To address this issue, we've combined a wide range of data sources to improve performance and generalization to new data by giving it a deeper understanding of the data representation from multi-modal datasets and developed a self-supervised framework based on large language models (LLMs), SwinV2 to gain a deeper understanding of multi-modal dataset representations, enhancing the model's ability to extrapolate to new data for the detection of eye diseases using optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. We adopt a two-phase training methodology, self-supervised pre-training, and fine-tuning on a downstream supervised classifier. An ablation study conducted across three datasets employing various encoder backbones, without data fusion, with low data availability setting, and without self-supervised pre-training scenarios, highlights the robustness of our method. Our findings demonstrate consistent performance across these diverse conditions, showcasing superior generalization capabilities compared to the baseline model, ResNet-50.</description>

      <title>Diversify and Conquer: Diversity-Centric Data Selection with Iterative Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finetuning large language models on instruction data is crucial for enhancing pre-trained knowledge and improving instruction-following capabilities. As instruction datasets proliferate, selecting optimal data for effective training becomes increasingly important. This work addresses the question: How can we determine the optimal subset of data for effective training? While existing research often emphasizes local criteria like instance quality for subset selection, we argue that a global approach focused on data diversity is more critical. Our method employs k-means clustering to ensure the selected subset effectively represents the full dataset. We propose an iterative refinement method inspired by active learning techniques to resample instances from clusters, reassessing each cluster's importance and sampling weight in every training iteration. This approach reduces the effect of outliers and automatically filters out clusters containing low-quality data. Through extensive evaluation across natural language reasoning, general world knowledge, code and math reasoning tasks, and by fine-tuning models from various families, we observe consistent improvements, achieving a 7% increase over random selection and a 3.8% improvement over state-of-the-art sampling methods. Our work highlights the significance of diversity-first sampling when finetuning LLMs to enhance performance across a broad array of evaluation tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/for-ai/iterative-data-selection.</description>

      <title>LLM-Agent-UMF: LLM-based Agent Unified Modeling Framework for Seamless Integration of Multi Active/Passive Core-Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of tools in LLM-based agents overcame the difficulties of standalone LLMs and traditional agents' limited capabilities. However, the conjunction of these technologies and the proposed enhancements in several state-of-the-art works followed a non-unified software architecture resulting in a lack of modularity. Indeed, they focused mainly on functionalities and overlooked the definition of the component's boundaries within the agent. This caused terminological and architectural ambiguities between researchers which we addressed in this paper by proposing a unified framework that establishes a clear foundation for LLM-based agents' development from both functional and software architectural perspectives.
  Our framework, LLM-Agent-UMF (LLM-based Agent Unified Modeling Framework), clearly distinguishes between the different components of an agent, setting LLMs, and tools apart from a newly introduced element: the core-agent, playing the role of the central coordinator of the agent which comprises five modules: planning, memory, profile, action, and security, the latter often neglected in previous works. Differences in the internal structure of core-agents led us to classify them into a taxonomy of passive and active types. Based on this, we proposed different multi-core agent architectures combining unique characteristics of various individual agents.
  For evaluation purposes, we applied this framework to a selection of state-of-the-art agents, thereby demonstrating its alignment with their functionalities and clarifying the overlooked architectural aspects. Moreover, we thoroughly assessed four of our proposed architectures by integrating distinctive agents into hybrid active/passive core-agents' systems. This analysis provided clear insights into potential improvements and highlighted the challenges involved in the combination of specific agents.</description>

      <title>NVLM: Open Frontier-Class Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce NVLM 1.0, a family of frontier-class multimodal large language models (LLMs) that achieve state-of-the-art results on vision-language tasks, rivaling the leading proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-access models (e.g., Llama 3-V 405B and InternVL 2). Remarkably, NVLM 1.0 shows improved text-only performance over its LLM backbone after multimodal training. In terms of model design, we perform a comprehensive comparison between decoder-only multimodal LLMs (e.g., LLaVA) and cross-attention-based models (e.g., Flamingo). Based on the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, we propose a novel architecture that enhances both training efficiency and multimodal reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we introduce a 1-D tile-tagging design for tile-based dynamic high-resolution images, which significantly boosts performance on multimodal reasoning and OCR-related tasks. Regarding training data, we meticulously curate and provide detailed information on our multimodal pretraining and supervised fine-tuning datasets. Our findings indicate that dataset quality and task diversity are more important than scale, even during the pretraining phase, across all architectures. Notably, we develop production-grade multimodality for the NVLM-1.0 models, enabling them to excel in vision-language tasks while maintaining and even improving text-only performance compared to their LLM backbones. To achieve this, we craft and integrate a high-quality text-only dataset into multimodal training, alongside a substantial amount of multimodal math and reasoning data, leading to enhanced math and coding capabilities across modalities. To advance research in the field, we are releasing the model weights and will open-source the code for the community: https://nvlm-project.github.io/.</description>

      <title>AraDiCE: Benchmarks for Dialectal and Cultural Capabilities in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arabic, with its rich diversity of dialects, remains significantly underrepresented in Large Language Models, particularly in dialectal variations. We address this gap by introducing seven synthetic datasets in dialects alongside Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), created using Machine Translation (MT) combined with human post-editing. We present AraDiCE, a benchmark for Arabic Dialect and Cultural Evaluation. We evaluate LLMs on dialect comprehension and generation, focusing specifically on low-resource Arabic dialects. Additionally, we introduce the first-ever fine-grained benchmark designed to evaluate cultural awareness across the Gulf, Egypt, and Levant regions, providing a novel dimension to LLM evaluation. Our findings demonstrate that while Arabic-specific models like Jais and AceGPT outperform multilingual models on dialectal tasks, significant challenges persist in dialect identification, generation, and translation. This work contributes ~45K post-edited samples, a cultural benchmark, and highlights the importance of tailored training to improve LLM performance in capturing the nuances of diverse Arabic dialects and cultural contexts. We will release the dialectal translation models and benchmarks curated in this study.</description>

      <title>Learning by Self-Explaining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08395v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much of explainable AI research treats explanations as a means for model inspection. Yet, this neglects findings from human psychology that describe the benefit of self-explanations in an agent's learning process. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel workflow in the context of image classification, termed Learning by Self-Explaining (LSX). LSX utilizes aspects of self-refining AI and human-guided explanatory machine learning. The underlying idea is that a learner model, in addition to optimizing for the original predictive task, is further optimized based on explanatory feedback from an internal critic model. Intuitively, a learner's explanations are considered "useful" if the internal critic can perform the same task given these explanations. We provide an overview of important components of LSX and, based on this, perform extensive experimental evaluations via three different example instantiations. Our results indicate improvements via Learning by Self-Explaining on several levels: in terms of model generalization, reducing the influence of confounding factors, and providing more task-relevant and faithful model explanations. Overall, our work provides evidence for the potential of self-explaining within the learning phase of an AI model.</description>

      <title>A Review of Prominent Paradigms for LLM-Based Agents: Tool Use (Including RAG), Planning, and Feedback Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tool use, planning, and feedback learning are currently three prominent paradigms for developing Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents across various tasks. Although numerous frameworks have been devised for each paradigm, their intricate workflows and inconsistent taxonomy create challenges in understanding and reviewing the frameworks across different paradigms. This survey introduces a unified taxonomy to systematically review and discuss these frameworks. Specifically, 1) the taxonomy defines environments/tasks, common LLM-profiled roles (policy models, evaluators, and dynamic models), and universally applicable workflows found in prior work, and 2) it enables a comparison of key perspectives on LMPR implementations and workflow usage across different agent paradigms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this tutorial, we present a compact and holistic discussion of Deep Learning with a focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and supervised regression. While there are numerous books and articles on the individual topics we cover, comprehensive and detailed tutorials that address Deep Learning from a foundational yet rigorous and accessible perspective are rare. Most resources on CNNs are either too advanced, focusing on cutting-edge architectures, or too narrow, addressing only specific applications like image classification.This tutorial not only summarizes the most relevant concepts but also provides an in-depth exploration of each, offering a complete yet agile set of ideas. Moreover, we highlight the powerful synergy between learning theory, statistic, and machine learning, which together underpin the Deep Learning and CNN frameworks. We aim for this tutorial to serve as an optimal resource for students, professors, and anyone interested in understanding the foundations of Deep Learning. Upon acceptance we will provide an accompanying repository under \href{https://github.com/neoglez/deep-learning-tutorial}{https://github.com/neoglez/deep-learning-tutorial}

      <title>DrugAgent: Explainable Drug Repurposing Agent with Large Language Model-based Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drug repurposing offers a promising avenue for accelerating drug development by identifying new therapeutic potentials of existing drugs. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent framework to enhance the drug repurposing process using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and knowledge integration. Our framework comprises several specialized agents: an AI Agent trains robust drug-target interaction (DTI) models; a Knowledge Graph Agent utilizes the drug-gene interaction database (DGIdb), DrugBank, Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), and Search Tool for Interactions of Chemicals (STITCH) to systematically extract DTIs; and a Search Agent interacts with biomedical literature to annotate and verify computational predictions. By integrating outputs from these agents, our system effectively harnesses diverse data sources, including external databases, to propose viable repurposing candidates. Preliminary results demonstrate the potential of our approach in not only predicting drug-disease interactions but also in reducing the time and cost associated with traditional drug discovery methods. This paper highlights the scalability of multi-agent systems in biomedical research and their role in driving innovation in drug repurposing. Our approach not only outperforms existing methods in predicting drug repurposing potential but also provides interpretable results, paving the way for more efficient and cost-effective drug discovery processes.</description>

Abstract: We use a large-scale experiment (N=8000) to determine whether GPT-4 can replicate cross-cultural differences in the Big Five, measured using the Ten-Item Personality Inventory. We used the US and South Korea as the cultural pair, given that prior research suggests substantial personality differences between people from these two countries. We manipulated the target of the simulation (US vs. Korean), the language of the inventory (English vs. Korean), and the language model (GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5). Our results show that GPT-4 replicated the cross-cultural differences for each factor. However, mean ratings had an upward bias and exhibited lower variation than in the human samples, as well as lower structural validity. We provide preliminary evidence that LLMs can aid cross-cultural researchers and practitioners.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern AI enables a high-level, declarative form of interaction: Users describe the intended outcome they wish an AI to produce, but do not actually create the outcome themselves. In contrast, in traditional user interfaces, users invoke specific operations to create the desired outcome. This paper revisits the basic input-output interaction cycle in light of this declarative style of interaction, and connects concepts in AI alignment to define three objectives for interactive alignment of AI: specification alignment (aligning on what to do), process alignment (aligning on how to do it), and evaluation alignment (assisting users in verifying and understanding what was produced). Using existing systems as examples, we show how these user-centered views of AI alignment can be used descriptively, prescriptively, and as an evaluative aid.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Epistemic Variance of Values for Risk-Aware Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of quantifying uncertainty over expected cumulative rewards in model-based reinforcement learning. In particular, we focus on characterizing the variance over values induced by a distribution over Markov decision processes (MDPs). Previous work upper bounds the posterior variance over values by solving a so-called uncertainty Bellman equation (UBE), but the over-approximation may result in inefficient exploration. We propose a new UBE whose solution converges to the true posterior variance over values and leads to lower regret in tabular exploration problems. We identify challenges to apply the UBE theory beyond tabular problems and propose a suitable approximation. Based on this approximation, we introduce a general-purpose policy optimization algorithm, Q-Uncertainty Soft Actor-Critic (QU-SAC), that can be applied for either risk-seeking or risk-averse policy optimization with minimal changes. Experiments in both online and offline RL demonstrate improved performance compared to other uncertainty estimation methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With easier access to powerful compute resources, there is a growing trend in AI for software development to develop large language models (LLMs) to address a variety of programming tasks. Even LLMs applied to tasks from the high-performance computing (HPC) domain are huge in size and demand expensive compute resources for training. This is partly because LLMs for HPC tasks are obtained by finetuning existing LLMs that support several natural and/or programming languages. We found this design choice confusing - why do we need LLMs trained on natural languages and programming languages unrelated to HPC for HPC-specific tasks? In this line of work, we aim to question choices made by existing LLMs by developing smaller language models (LMs) for specific domains - we call them domain-specific LMs. Specifically, we start with HPC as a domain and build an HPC-specific LM, named MonoCoder, which is orders of magnitude smaller than existing LMs but delivers better performance on non-HPC and HPC codes. Specifically, we pre-trained MonoCoder on an HPC-specific dataset (named HPCorpus) of C and C++ programs mined from GitHub. We evaluated the performance of MonoCoder against state-of-the-art multi-lingual LLMs. Results demonstrate that MonoCoder, although much smaller than existing LMs, outperforms other LLMs on normalized-perplexity tests (in relation to model size) while also delivering competing CodeBLEU scores for high-performance and parallel code generations. In other words, results suggest that MonoCoder understands HPC code better than state-of-the-art LLMs.</description>

      <title>Information That Matters: Exploring Information Needs of People Affected by Algorithmic Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13324v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every AI system that makes decisions about people has a group of stakeholders that are personally affected by these decisions. However, explanations of AI systems rarely address the information needs of this stakeholder group, who often are AI novices. This creates a gap between conveyed information and information that matters to those who are impacted by the system's decisions, such as domain experts and decision subjects. To address this, we present the "XAI Novice Question Bank," an extension of the XAI Question Bank containing a catalog of information needs from AI novices in two use cases: employment prediction and health monitoring. The catalog covers the categories of data, system context, system usage, and system specifications. We gathered information needs through task-based interviews where participants asked questions about two AI systems to decide on their adoption and received verbal explanations in response. Our analysis showed that participants' confidence increased after receiving explanations but that their understanding faced challenges. These included difficulties in locating information and in assessing their own understanding, as well as attempts to outsource understanding. Additionally, participants' prior perceptions of the systems' risks and benefits influenced their information needs. Participants who perceived high risks sought explanations about the intentions behind a system's deployment, while those who perceived low risks rather asked about the system's operation. Our work aims to support the inclusion of AI novices in explainability efforts by highlighting their information needs, aims, and challenges. We summarize our findings as five key implications that can inform the design of future explanations for lay stakeholder audiences.</description>

      <title>Towards Goal-oriented Prompt Engineering for Large Language Models: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown prominent performance in various downstream tasks and prompt engineering plays a pivotal role in optimizing LLMs' performance. This paper, not only as an overview of current prompt engineering methods, but also aims to highlight the limitation of designing prompts based on an anthropomorphic assumption that expects LLMs to think like humans. From our review of 50 representative studies, we demonstrate that a goal-oriented prompt formulation, which guides LLMs to follow established human logical thinking, significantly improves the performance of LLMs. Furthermore, We introduce a novel taxonomy that categorizes goal-oriented prompting methods into five interconnected stages and we demonstrate the broad applicability of our framework. With four future directions proposed, we hope to further emphasize the power and potential of goal-oriented prompt engineering in all fields.</description>

      <title>Beyond principlism: Practical strategies for ethical AI use in research practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in scientific research, particularly large language models (LLMs), has outpaced the development of ethical guidelines, leading to a Triple-Too problem: too many high-level ethical initiatives, too abstract principles lacking contextual and practical relevance, and too much focus on restrictions and risks over benefits and utilities. Existing approaches, such as principlism (reliance on abstract ethical principles), formalism (rigid application of rules), and technical solutionism (overemphasis on technological fixes), offer little practical guidance for addressing ethical challenges of AI in scientific research practices. To bridge the gap between abstract principles and day-to-day research practices, we propose a user-centered, realism-inspired approach. We outline five specific goals for ethical AI use: 1) understanding model training and output, including bias mitigation strategies; 2) respecting privacy, confidentiality, and copyright; 3) avoiding plagiarism and policy violations; 4) applying AI beneficially compared to alternatives; and 5) using AI transparently and reproducibly. For each goal, we provide actionable strategies and analyze realistic cases of misuse and corrective measures. We argue that ethical AI application requires evaluating its utility against existing alternatives rather than isolated performance metrics. Additionally, we propose documentation guidelines to enhance transparency and reproducibility in AI-assisted research. Moving forward, we emphasize the need for targeted professional development, training programs, and balanced enforcement mechanisms to promote responsible AI use while fostering innovation. By refining these ethical guidelines and adapting to emerging AI capabilities, we can accelerate scientific progress without compromising research integrity.</description>

      <title>COBIAS: Contextual Reliability in Bias Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14889v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often inherit biases from the web data they are trained on, which contains stereotypes and prejudices. Current methods for evaluating and mitigating these biases rely on bias-benchmark datasets. These benchmarks measure bias by observing an LLM's behavior on biased statements. However, these statements lack contextual considerations of the situations they try to present. To address this, we introduce a contextual reliability framework, which evaluates model robustness to biased statements by considering the various contexts in which they may appear. We develop the Context-Oriented Bias Indicator and Assessment Score (COBIAS) to measure a biased statement's reliability in detecting bias based on the variance in model behavior across different contexts. To evaluate the metric, we augment 2,291 stereotyped statements from two existing benchmark datasets by adding contextual information. We show that COBIAS aligns with human judgment on the contextual reliability of biased statements (Spearman's $\rho = 0.65$, $p = 3.4 * 10^{-60}$) and can be used to create reliable datasets, which would assist bias mitigation works.</description>

      <title>On Evaluation Protocols for Data Augmentation in a Limited Data Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Textual data augmentation (DA) is a prolific field of study where novel techniques to create artificial data are regularly proposed, and that has demonstrated great efficiency on small data settings, at least for text classification tasks. In this paper, we challenge those results, showing that classical data augmentation (which modify sentences) is simply a way of performing better fine-tuning, and that spending more time doing so before applying data augmentation negates its effect. This is a significant contribution as it answers several questions that were left open in recent years, namely~: which DA technique performs best (all of them as long as they generate data close enough to the training set, as to not impair training) and why did DA show positive results (facilitates training of network). We further show that zero- and few-shot DA via conversational agents such as ChatGPT or LLama2 can increase performances, confirming that this form of data augmentation is preferable to classical methods.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual contrastive learning: robust representations via causal image synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive pretraining is well-known to improve downstream task performance and model generalisation, especially in limited label settings. However, it is sensitive to the choice of augmentation pipeline. Positive pairs should preserve semantic information while destroying domain-specific information. Standard augmentation pipelines emulate domain-specific changes with pre-defined photometric transformations, but what if we could simulate realistic domain changes instead? In this work, we show how to utilise recent progress in counterfactual image generation to this effect. We propose CF-SimCLR, a counterfactual contrastive learning approach which leverages approximate counterfactual inference for positive pair creation. Comprehensive evaluation across five datasets, on chest radiography and mammography, demonstrates that CF-SimCLR substantially improves robustness to acquisition shift with higher downstream performance on both in- and out-of-distribution data, particularly for domains which are under-represented during training.</description>

      <title>Manipulating and Mitigating Generative Model Biases without Retraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models have gained increased popularity in the public domain. While boasting impressive user-guided generative abilities, their black-box nature exposes users to intentionally- and intrinsically-biased outputs. Bias manipulation (and mitigation) techniques typically rely on careful tuning of learning parameters and training data to adjust decision boundaries to influence model bias characteristics, which is often computationally demanding. We propose a dynamic and computationally efficient manipulation of T2I model biases by exploiting their rich language embedding spaces without model retraining. We show that leveraging foundational vector algebra allows for a convenient control over language model embeddings to shift T2I model outputs and control the distribution of generated classes. As a by-product, this control serves as a form of precise prompt engineering to generate images which are generally implausible using regular text prompts. We demonstrate a constructive application of our technique by balancing the frequency of social classes in generated images, effectively balancing class distributions across three social bias dimensions. We also highlight a negative implication of bias manipulation by framing our method as a backdoor attack with severity control using semantically-null input triggers, reporting up to 100% attack success rate.

      <title>Does Biomedical Training Lead to Better Medical Performance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04067v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to significantly contribute to patient care, diagnostics, and administrative processes. Emerging biomedical LLMs aim to address healthcare-specific challenges, including privacy demands and computational constraints. Assessing the models' suitability for this sensitive application area is of the utmost importance. However, biomedical training has not been systematically evaluated on medical tasks. This study investigates the effect of biomedical training in the context of six practical medical tasks evaluating $25$ models. In contrast to previous evaluations, our results reveal a performance decline in nine out of twelve biomedical models after fine-tuning, particularly on tasks involving hallucinations, ICD10 coding, and instruction adherence. General-domain models like Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct outperformed their biomedical counterparts, indicating a trade-off between domain-specific fine-tuning and general medical task performance. We open-source all evaluation scripts and datasets at https://github.com/TIO-IKIM/CLUE to support further research in this critical area.</description>

      <title>Exploring Concept Depth: How Large Language Models Acquire Knowledge at Different Layers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07066v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performances across a wide range of tasks. However, the mechanisms by which these models encode tasks of varying complexities remain poorly understood. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that LLMs process concepts of varying complexities in different layers, introducing the idea of ``Concept Depth'' to suggest that more complex concepts are typically acquired in deeper layers. Specifically, we categorize concepts based on their level of abstraction, defining them in the order of increasing complexity within factual, emotional, and inferential tasks. We conduct extensive probing experiments using layer-wise representations across various LLM families (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) on various datasets spanning the three domains of tasks. Our findings reveal that models could efficiently conduct probing for simpler tasks in shallow layers, and more complex tasks typically necessitate deeper layers for accurate understanding. Additionally, we examine how external factors, such as adding noise to the input and quantizing the model weights, might affect layer-wise representations. Our findings suggest that these factors can impede the development of a conceptual understanding of LLMs until deeper layers are explored. We hope that our proposed concept and experimental insights will enhance the understanding of the mechanisms underlying LLMs. Our codes are available at \url{https://github.com/Luckfort/CD}.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Can Continue Evolving From Mistakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08707v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As world knowledge evolves and new task schemas emerge, Continual Learning (CL) is crucial for keeping Large Language Models (LLMs) up-to-date and addressing their shortcomings. LLMs typically require continual instruction tuning (CIT) and continual pre-training (CPT) to adapt to new tasks and acquire essential knowledge. However, collecting sufficient CPT data while addressing knowledge gaps remains challenging, as does optimizing the efficiency of utilizing this data. Inspired by the 'summarizing mistakes' strategy, we propose the Continue Evolving from Mistakes (CEM) method, a data-efficient approach aiming to collect CPT data and continually improve LLMs' performance through iterative evaluation and supplementation with mistake-relevant knowledge. To enhance data utilization and mitigate forgetting, we introduce a novel training paradigm that combines CIT and CPT data. Experiments demonstrate that CEM significantly enhances model performance and continual evolution. The code and dataset are available in the GitHub.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown remarkable success in simulation domains, yet its application in designing robot controllers remains limited, due to its single-task orientation and insufficient adaptability to environmental changes. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel adaptive agent that leverages transfer learning techniques to dynamically adapt policy in response to different tasks and environmental conditions. The approach is validated through the blimp control challenge, where multitasking capabilities and environmental adaptability are essential. The agent is trained using a custom, highly parallelized simulator built on IsaacGym. We perform zero-shot transfer to fly the blimp in the real world to solve various tasks. We share our code at \url{https://github.com/robot-perception-group/adaptive\_agent/}.</description>

      <title>GISR: Geometric Initialization and Silhouette-based Refinement for Single-View Robot Pose and Configuration Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In autonomous robotics, measurement of the robot's internal state and perception of its environment, including interaction with other agents such as collaborative robots, are essential. Estimating the pose of the robot arm from a single view has the potential to replace classical eye-to-hand calibration approaches and is particularly attractive for online estimation and dynamic environments. In addition to its pose, recovering the robot configuration provides a complete spatial understanding of the observed robot that can be used to anticipate the actions of other agents in advanced robotics use cases. Furthermore, this additional redundancy enables the planning and execution of recovery protocols in case of sensor failures or external disturbances. We introduce GISR - a deep configuration and robot-to-camera pose estimation method that prioritizes execution in real-time. GISR consists of two modules: (i) a geometric initialization module that efficiently computes an approximate robot pose and configuration, and (ii) a deep iterative silhouette-based refinement module that arrives at a final solution in just a few iterations. We evaluate GISR on publicly available data and show that it outperforms existing methods of the same class in terms of both speed and accuracy, and can compete with approaches that rely on ground-truth proprioception and recover only the pose.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explicitly construct zero loss neural network classifiers. We write the weight matrices and bias vectors in terms of cumulative parameters, which determine truncation maps acting recursively on input space. The configurations for the training data considered are (i) sufficiently small, well separated clusters corresponding to each class, and (ii) equivalence classes which are sequentially linearly separable. In the best case, for $Q$ classes of data in $\mathbb{R}^M$, global minimizers can be described with $Q(M+2)$ parameters.</description>

      <title>RuleFuser: An Evidential Bayes Approach for Rule Injection in Imitation Learned Planners and Predictors for Robustness under Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern motion planners for autonomous driving frequently use imitation learning (IL) to draw from expert driving logs. Although IL benefits from its ability to glean nuanced and multi-modal human driving behaviors from large datasets, the resulting planners often struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and with traffic rule compliance. On the other hand, classical rule-based planners, by design, can generate safe traffic rule compliant behaviors while being robust to OOD scenarios, but these planners fail to capture nuances in agent-to-agent interactions and human drivers' intent. RuleFuser, an evidential framework, combines IL planners with classical rule-based planners to draw on the complementary benefits of both, thereby striking a balance between imitation and safety.
  Our approach, tested on the real-world nuPlan dataset, combines the IL planner's high performance in in-distribution (ID) scenarios with the rule-based planners' enhanced safety in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, achieving a 38.43% average improvement on safety metrics over the IL planner without much detriment to imitation metrics in OOD scenarios.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Image Diffusion: Generation of Image Sequence and Application in MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used non-invasive imaging modality. However, a persistent challenge lies in balancing image quality with imaging speed. This trade-off is primarily constrained by k-space measurements, which traverse specific trajectories in the spatial Fourier domain (k-space). These measurements are often undersampled to shorten acquisition times, resulting in image artifacts and compromised quality. Generative models learn image distributions and can be used to reconstruct high-quality images from undersampled k-space data. In this work, we present the autoregressive image diffusion (AID) model for image sequences and use it to sample the posterior for accelerated MRI reconstruction. The algorithm incorporates both undersampled k-space and pre-existing information. Models trained with fastMRI dataset are evaluated comprehensively. The results show that the AID model can robustly generate sequentially coherent image sequences. In 3D and dynamic MRI, the AID can outperform the standard diffusion model and reduce hallucinations, due to the learned inter-image dependencies.</description>

      <title>Label-Looping: Highly Efficient Decoding for Transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a highly efficient greedy decoding algorithm for Transducer-based speech recognition models. We redesign the standard nested-loop design for RNN-T decoding, swapping loops over frames and labels: the outer loop iterates over labels, while the inner loop iterates over frames searching for the next non-blank symbol. Additionally, we represent partial hypotheses in a special structure using CUDA tensors, supporting parallelized hypotheses manipulations. Experiments show that the label-looping algorithm is up to 2.0X faster than conventional batched decoding when using batch size 32. It can be further combined with other compiler or GPU call-related techniques to achieve even more speedup. Our algorithm is general-purpose and can work with both conventional Transducers and Token-and-Duration Transducers. We open-source our implementation to benefit the research community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proactive content moderation requires platforms to rapidly and continuously evaluate the credibility of websites. Leveraging the direct and indirect paths users follow to unreliable websites, we develop a website credibility classification and discovery system that integrates both webgraph and large-scale social media contexts. We additionally introduce the concept of dredge words, terms or phrases for which unreliable domains rank highly on search engines, and provide the first exploration of their usage on social media. Our graph neural networks that combine webgraph and social media contexts generate to state-of-the-art results in website credibility classification and significantly improves the top-k identification of unreliable domains. Additionally, we release a novel dataset of dredge words, highlighting their strong connections to both social media and online commerce platforms.</description>

      <title>Design Optimization of NOMA Aided Multi-STAR-RIS for Indoor Environments: A Convex Approximation Imitated Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) enables multiple users to share the same frequency band, and simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) provides 360-degree full-space coverage, optimizing both transmission and reflection for improved network performance and dynamic control of the indoor environment. However, deploying STAR-RIS indoors presents challenges in interference mitigation, power consumption, and real-time configuration. In this work, a novel network architecture utilizing multiple access points (APs), STAR-RISs, and NOMA is proposed for indoor communication. To address these, we formulate an optimization problem involving user assignment, access point (AP) beamforming, and STAR-RIS phase control. A decomposition approach is used to solve the complex problem efficiently, employing a many-to-one matching algorithm for user-AP assignment and K-means clustering for resource management. Additionally, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) is leveraged to optimize the control of the STAR-RIS. Within the proposed MADRL framework, a novel approach is introduced in which each decision variable acts as an independent agent, enabling collaborative learning and decision making. The MADRL framework is enhanced by incorporating convex approximation (CA), which accelerates policy learning through suboptimal solutions from successive convex approximation (SCA), leading to faster adaptation and convergence. Simulations demonstrate significant improvements in network utility compared to baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>SynDARin: Synthesising Datasets for Automated Reasoning in Low-Resource Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Question Answering (QA) datasets have been instrumental in developing and evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities. However, such datasets are scarce for languages other than English due to the cost and difficulties of collection and manual annotation. This means that producing novel models and measuring the performance of multilingual LLMs in low-resource languages is challenging. To mitigate this, we propose $\textbf{S}$yn$\textbf{DAR}$in, a method for generating and validating QA datasets for low-resource languages. We utilize parallel content mining to obtain $\textit{human-curated}$ paragraphs between English and the target language. We use the English data as context to $\textit{generate}$ synthetic multiple-choice (MC) question-answer pairs, which are automatically translated and further validated for quality. Combining these with their designated non-English $\textit{human-curated}$ paragraphs form the final QA dataset. The method allows to maintain the content quality, reduces the likelihood of factual errors, and circumvents the need for costly annotation. To test the method, we created a QA dataset with $1.2$K samples for the Armenian language. The human evaluation shows that $98\%$ of the generated English data maintains quality and diversity in the question types and topics, while the translation validation pipeline can filter out $\sim70\%$ of data with poor quality. We use the dataset to benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs, showing their inability to achieve human accuracy with some model performances closer to random chance. This shows that the generated dataset is non-trivial and can be used to evaluate reasoning capabilities in low-resource language.</description>

      <title>Fault Detection for agents on power grid topology optimization: A Comprehensive analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16426v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimizing the topology of transmission networks using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has increasingly come into focus. Various DRL agents have been proposed, which are mostly benchmarked on the Grid2Op environment from the Learning to Run a Power Network (L2RPN) challenges. The environments have many advantages with their realistic grid scenarios and underlying power flow backends. However, the interpretation of agent survival or failure is not always clear, as there are a variety of potential causes. In this work, we focus on the failures of the power grid simulation to identify patterns and detect them in advance. We collect the failed scenarios of three different agents on the WCCI 2022 L2RPN environment, totaling about 40k data points. By clustering, we are able to detect five distinct clusters, identifying common failure types. Further, we propose a multi-class prediction approach to detect failures beforehand and evaluate five different prediction models. Here, the Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM) shows the best failure prediction performance, with an accuracy of 82%. It also accurately classifies whether a the grid survives or fails in 87% of cases. Finally, we provide a detailed feature importance analysis that identifies critical features and regions in the grid.</description>

      <title>EmPO: Emotion Grounding for Empathetic Response Generation through Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empathetic response generation is a desirable aspect of conversational agents, crucial for facilitating engaging and emotionally intelligent multi-turn conversations between humans and machines. Leveraging large language models for this task has shown promising results, yet challenges persist in ensuring both the empathetic quality of the responses and retention of the generalization performance of the models. We propose a novel approach where we construct theory-driven preference datasets based on emotion grounding and use them to align LLMs with preference optimization algorithms to address these challenges. To evaluate empathetic response generation, we employ the EmpatheticDialogues dataset, assessing empathy with the diff-Epitome and BERTscore metrics and with multi-dimensional human evaluation. Additionally, we measure diversity and emotional valence using feature-based methods. We also evaluate the impact of training on the generalization performance using the MMLU benchmark and tasks from the Open LLM Leaderboard. The results show that LLMs can be aligned for empathetic response generation by preference optimization while retaining their general performance and that emotion grounding can guide preference dataset creation. We make all datasets, source code, and models publicly available. https://github.com/justtherightsize/empo</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most instance perception and image understanding solutions focus mainly on natural images. However, applications for synthetic images, and more specifically, images of Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) remain limited. This hinders the development of autonomous computer-vision-powered Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents. In this work, we present Instruction Visual Grounding or IVG, a multi-modal solution for object identification in a GUI. More precisely, given a natural language instruction and GUI screen, IVG locates the coordinates of the element on the screen where the instruction would be executed. To this end, we develop two methods. The first method is a three-part architecture that relies on a combination of a Large Language Model (LLM) and an object detection model. The second approach uses a multi-modal foundation model.</description>

      <title>CANDID DAC: Leveraging Coupled Action Dimensions with Importance Differences in DAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional action spaces remain a challenge for dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC). Interdependencies and varying importance between action dimensions are further known key characteristics of DAC problems. We argue that these Coupled Action Dimensions with Importance Differences (CANDID) represent aspects of the DAC problem that are not yet fully explored. To address this gap, we introduce a new white-box benchmark within the DACBench suite that simulates the properties of CANDID. Further, we propose sequential policies as an effective strategy for managing these properties. Such policies factorize the action space and mitigate exponential growth by learning a policy per action dimension. At the same time, these policies accommodate the interdependence of action dimensions by fostering implicit coordination. We show this in an experimental study of value-based policies on our new benchmark. This study demonstrates that sequential policies significantly outperform independent learning of factorized policies in CANDID action spaces. In addition, they overcome the scalability limitations associated with learning a single policy across all action dimensions. The code used for our experiments is available under https://github.com/PhilippBordne/candidDAC.</description>

      <title>Laugh Now Cry Later: Controlling Time-Varying Emotional States of Flow-Matching-Based Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People change their tones of voice, often accompanied by nonverbal vocalizations (NVs) such as laughter and cries, to convey rich emotions. However, most text-to-speech (TTS) systems lack the capability to generate speech with rich emotions, including NVs. This paper introduces EmoCtrl-TTS, an emotion-controllable zero-shot TTS that can generate highly emotional speech with NVs for any speaker. EmoCtrl-TTS leverages arousal and valence values, as well as laughter embeddings, to condition the flow-matching-based zero-shot TTS. To achieve high-quality emotional speech generation, EmoCtrl-TTS is trained using more than 27,000 hours of expressive data curated based on pseudo-labeling. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that EmoCtrl-TTS excels in mimicking the emotions of audio prompts in speech-to-speech translation scenarios. We also show that EmoCtrl-TTS can capture emotion changes, express strong emotions, and generate various NVs in zero-shot TTS. See https://aka.ms/emoctrl-tts for demo samples.</description>

      <title>StuGPTViz: A Visual Analytics Approach to Understand Student-ChatGPT Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially ChatGPT, into education is poised to revolutionize students' learning experiences by introducing innovative conversational learning methodologies. To empower students to fully leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT in educational scenarios, understanding students' interaction patterns with ChatGPT is crucial for instructors. However, this endeavor is challenging due to the absence of datasets focused on student-ChatGPT conversations and the complexities in identifying and analyzing the evolutional interaction patterns within conversations. To address these challenges, we collected conversational data from 48 students interacting with ChatGPT in a master's level data visualization course over one semester. We then developed a coding scheme, grounded in the literature on cognitive levels and thematic analysis, to categorize students' interaction patterns with ChatGPT. Furthermore, we present a visual analytics system, StuGPTViz, that tracks and compares temporal patterns in student prompts and the quality of ChatGPT's responses at multiple scales, revealing significant pedagogical insights for instructors. We validated the system's effectiveness through expert interviews with six data visualization instructors and three case studies. The results confirmed StuGPTViz's capacity to enhance educators' insights into the pedagogical value of ChatGPT. We also discussed the potential research opportunities of applying visual analytics in education and developing AI-driven personalized learning solutions.</description>

      <title>Learning Multi-Modal Whole-Body Control for Real-World Humanoid Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The foundational capabilities of humanoid robots should include robustly standing, walking, and mimicry of whole and partial-body motions. This work introduces the Masked Humanoid Controller (MHC), which supports all of these capabilities by tracking target trajectories over selected subsets of humanoid state variables while ensuring balance and robustness against disturbances. The MHC is trained in simulation using a carefully designed curriculum that imitates partially masked motions from a library of behaviors spanning standing, walking, optimized reference trajectories, re-targeted video clips, and human motion capture data. It also allows for combining joystick-based control with partial-body motion mimicry. We showcase simulation experiments validating the MHC's ability to execute a wide variety of behaviors from partially-specified target motions. Moreover, we demonstrate sim-to-real transfer on the real-world Digit V3 humanoid robot. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of a learned controller that can realize whole-body control of a real-world humanoid for such diverse multi-modal targets.</description>

      <title>Towards flexible perception with visual memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training a neural network is a monolithic endeavor, akin to carving knowledge into stone: once the process is completed, editing the knowledge in a network is nearly impossible, since all information is distributed across the network's weights. We here explore a simple, compelling alternative by marrying the representational power of deep neural networks with the flexibility of a database. Decomposing the task of image classification into image similarity (from a pre-trained embedding) and search (via fast nearest neighbor retrieval from a knowledge database), we build a simple and flexible visual memory that has the following key capabilities: (1.) The ability to flexibly add data across scales: from individual samples all the way to entire classes and billion-scale data; (2.) The ability to remove data through unlearning and memory pruning; (3.) An interpretable decision-mechanism on which we can intervene to control its behavior. Taken together, these capabilities comprehensively demonstrate the benefits of an explicit visual memory. We hope that it might contribute to a conversation on how knowledge should be represented in deep vision models -- beyond carving it in "stone" weights.</description>

      <title>Advancing Cyber Incident Timeline Analysis Through Rule Based AI and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Timeline Analysis (TA) plays a crucial role in Timeline Forensics (TF) within the field of Digital Forensics (DF). It focuses on examining and analyzing time-based digital artefacts, such as timestamps derived from event logs, file metadata, and other relevant data, to correlate events linked to cyber incidents and reconstruct their chronological sequence. Traditional tools often struggle to efficiently handle the large volume and variety of data generated during DF investigations and Incident Response (IR) processes. This paper introduces a novel framework, GenDFIR, which combines Rule-Based Artificial Intelligence (R-BAI) algorithms with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance and automate the TA process. The proposed approach consists of two key stages: (1) R-BAI is used to identify and select anomalous digital artefacts based on predefined rules. (2) The selected artefacts are then transformed into embeddings for processing by an LLM with the assistance of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent. The LLM uses its capabilities to perform automated TA on the artefacts and predict potential incident outcomes. To validate the framework, we evaluated its performance, efficiency, and reliability. Several metrics were applied to simulated cyber incident scenarios, which were presented as forensic case documents. Our findings demonstrate the significant potential of integrating R-BAI and LLMs for TA. This innovative approach underscores the power of Generative AI (GenAI), particularly LLMs, and opens up new possibilities for advanced threat detection and incident reconstruction, marking a significant advancement in the field.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks with LSTM and GRU in Modeling Active Fires in the Amazon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive methodology for modeling and forecasting the historical time series of active fire spots detected by the AQUA\_M-T satellite in the Amazon, Brazil. The approach employs a mixed Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures to predict the monthly accumulations of daily detected active fire spots. Data analysis revealed a consistent seasonality over time, with annual maximum and minimum values tending to repeat at the same periods each year. The primary objective is to verify whether the forecasts capture this inherent seasonality through machine learning techniques. The methodology involved careful data preparation, model configuration, and training using cross-validation with two seeds, ensuring that the data generalizes well to both the test and validation sets for both seeds. The results indicate that the combined LSTM and GRU model delivers excellent forecasting performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex temporal patterns and modeling the observed time series. This research significantly contributes to the application of deep learning techniques in environmental monitoring, specifically in forecasting active fire spots. The proposed approach highlights the potential for adaptation to other time series forecasting challenges, opening new opportunities for research and development in machine learning and prediction of natural phenomena.

      <title>Elsevier Arena: Human Evaluation of Chemistry/Biology/Health Foundational Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quality and capabilities of large language models cannot be currently fully assessed with automated, benchmark evaluations. Instead, human evaluations that expand on traditional qualitative techniques from natural language generation literature are required. One recent best-practice consists in using A/B-testing frameworks, which capture preferences of human evaluators for specific models. In this paper we describe a human evaluation experiment focused on the biomedical domain (health, biology, chemistry/pharmacology) carried out at Elsevier. In it a large but not massive (8.8B parameter) decoder-only foundational transformer trained on a relatively small (135B tokens) but highly curated collection of Elsevier datasets is compared to OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo and Meta's foundational 7B parameter Llama 2 model against multiple criteria. Results indicate -- even if IRR scores were generally low -- a preference towards GPT-3.5-turbo, and hence towards models that possess conversational abilities, are very large and were trained on very large datasets. But at the same time, indicate that for less massive models training on smaller but well-curated training sets can potentially give rise to viable alternatives in the biomedical domain.</description>

      <title>Larger Language Models Don't Care How You Think: Why Chain-of-Thought Prompting Fails in Subjective Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) in Large Language Models (LLM) has emerged as the dominant technique for performing natural language tasks, as it does not require updating the model parameters with gradient-based methods. ICL promises to "adapt" the LLM to perform the present task at a competitive or state-of-the-art level at a fraction of the computational cost. ICL can be augmented by incorporating the reasoning process to arrive at the final label explicitly in the prompt, a technique called Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, recent work has found that ICL relies mostly on the retrieval of task priors and less so on "learning" to perform tasks, especially for complex subjective domains like emotion and morality, where priors ossify posterior predictions. In this work, we examine whether "enabling" reasoning also creates the same behavior in LLMs, wherein the format of CoT retrieves reasoning priors that remain relatively unchanged despite the evidence in the prompt. We find that, surprisingly, CoT indeed suffers from the same posterior collapse as ICL for larger language models. Code is avalaible at https://github.com/gchochla/cot-priors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scaling law hypothesis for multimodal models processing text, audio, images, and video within a shared token and embedding space. Our framework predicts model performance based on modality-specific compression and tokenization efficiency, extending established scaling laws from text-based decoder models to mixed-modality systems. We explore whether leveraging more training data in multiple modalities can reduce the size of the multimodal model, enabling efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices.</description>

      <title>Operational Wind Speed Forecasts for Chile's Electric Power Sector Using a Hybrid ML Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Chile's electric power sector advances toward a future powered by renewable energy, accurate forecasting of renewable generation is essential for managing grid operations. The integration of renewable energy sources is particularly challenging due to the operational difficulties of managing their power generation, which is highly variable compared to fossil fuel sources, delaying the availability of clean energy. To mitigate this, we quantify the impact of increasing intermittent generation from wind and solar on thermal power plants in Chile and introduce a hybrid wind speed forecasting methodology which combines two custom ML models for Chile. The first model is based on TiDE, an MLP-based ML model for short-term forecasts, and the second is based on a graph neural network, GraphCast, for medium-term forecasts up to 10 days. Our hybrid approach outperforms the most accurate operational deterministic systems by 4-21% for short-term forecasts and 5-23% for medium-term forecasts and can directly lower the impact of wind generation on thermal ramping, curtailment, and system-level emissions in Chile.</description>

      <title>Wave-U-Mamba: An End-To-End Framework For High-Quality And Efficient Speech Super Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech Super-Resolution (SSR) is a task of enhancing low-resolution speech signals by restoring missing high-frequency components. Conventional approaches typically reconstruct log-mel features, followed by a vocoder that generates high-resolution speech in the waveform domain. However, as log-mel features lack phase information, this can result in performance degradation during the reconstruction phase. Motivated by recent advances with Selective State Spaces Models (SSMs), we propose a method, referred to as Wave-U-Mamba that directly performs SSR in time domain. In our comparative study, including models such as WSRGlow, NU-Wave 2, and AudioSR, Wave-U-Mamba demonstrates superior performance, achieving the lowest Log-Spectral Distance (LSD) across various low-resolution sampling rates, ranging from 8 kHz to 24 kHz. Additionally, subjective human evaluations, scored using Mean Opinion Score (MOS) reveal that our method produces SSR with natural and human-like quality. Furthermore, Wave-U-Mamba achieves these results while generating high-resolution speech over nine times faster than baseline models on a single A100 GPU, with parameter sizes less than 2% of those in the baseline models.</description>

      <title>LLM-Powered Ensemble Learning for Paper Source Tracing: A GPU-Free Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We participated in the KDD CUP 2024 paper source tracing competition and achieved the 3rd place. This competition tasked participants with identifying the reference sources (i.e., ref-sources, as referred to by the organizers of the competition) of given academic papers. Unlike most teams that addressed this challenge by fine-tuning pre-trained neural language models such as BERT or ChatGLM, our primary approach utilized closed-source large language models (LLMs). With recent advancements in LLM technology, closed-source LLMs have demonstrated the capability to tackle complex reasoning tasks in zero-shot or few-shot scenarios. Consequently, in the absence of GPUs, we employed closed-source LLMs to directly generate predicted reference sources from the provided papers. We further refined these predictions through ensemble learning. Notably, our method was the only one among the award-winning approaches that did not require the use of GPUs for model training.

      <title>AACessTalk: Fostering Communication between Minimally Verbal Autistic Children and Parents with Contextual Guidance and Card Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As minimally verbal autistic (MVA) children communicate with parents through few words and nonverbal cues, parents often struggle to encourage their children to express subtle emotions and needs and to grasp their nuanced signals. We present AACessTalk, a tablet-based, AI-mediated communication system that facilitates meaningful exchanges between an MVA child and a parent. AACessTalk provides real-time guides to the parent to engage the child in conversation and, in turn, recommends contextual vocabulary cards to the child. Through a two-week deployment study with 11 MVA child-parent dyads, we examine how AACessTalk fosters everyday conversation practice and mutual engagement. Our findings show high engagement from all dyads, leading to increased frequency of conversation and turn-taking. AACessTalk also encouraged parents to explore their own interaction strategies and empowered the children to have more agency in communication. We discuss the implications of designing technologies for balanced communication dynamics in parent-MVA child interaction.</description>

      <title>ExploreSelf: Fostering User-driven Exploration and Reflection on Personal Challenges with Adaptive Guidance by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Expressing stressful experiences in words is proven to improve mental and physical health, but individuals often disengage with writing interventions as they struggle to organize their thoughts and emotions. Reflective prompts have been used to provide direction, and large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the potential to provide tailored guidance. Current systems often limit users' flexibility to direct their reflections. We thus present ExploreSelf, an LLM-driven application designed to empower users to control their reflective journey. ExploreSelf allows users to receive adaptive support through dynamically generated questions. Through an exploratory study with 19 participants, we examine how participants explore and reflect on personal challenges using ExploreSelf. Our findings demonstrate that participants valued the balance between guided support and freedom to control their reflective journey, leading to deeper engagement and insight. Building on our findings, we discuss implications for designing LLM-driven tools that promote user empowerment through effective reflective practices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given recent advances in generative AI technology, a key question is how large language models (LLMs) can enhance acoustic modeling tasks using text decoding results from a frozen, pretrained automatic speech recognition (ASR) model. To explore new capabilities in language modeling for speech processing, we introduce the generative speech transcription error correction (GenSEC) challenge. This challenge comprises three post-ASR language modeling tasks: (i) post-ASR transcription correction, (ii) speaker tagging, and (iii) emotion recognition. These tasks aim to emulate future LLM-based agents handling voice-based interfaces while remaining accessible to a broad audience by utilizing open pretrained language models or agent-based APIs. We also discuss insights from baseline evaluations, as well as lessons learned for designing future evaluations.</description>

      <title>REG: Refined Generalized Focal Loss for Road Asset Detection on Thai Highways Using Vision-Based Detection and Segmentation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for detecting and segmenting critical road assets on Thai highways using an advanced Refined Generalized Focal Loss (REG) formulation. Integrated into state-of-the-art vision-based detection and segmentation models, the proposed method effectively addresses class imbalance and the challenges of localizing small, underrepresented road elements, including pavilions, pedestrian bridges, information signs, single-arm poles, bus stops, warning signs, and concrete guardrails. To improve both detection and segmentation accuracy, a multi-task learning strategy is adopted, optimizing REG across multiple tasks. REG is further enhanced by incorporating a spatial-contextual adjustment term, which accounts for the spatial distribution of road assets, and a probabilistic refinement that captures prediction uncertainty in complex environments, such as varying lighting conditions and cluttered backgrounds. Our rigorous mathematical formulation demonstrates that REG minimizes localization and classification errors by applying adaptive weighting to hard-to-detect instances while down-weighting easier examples. Experimental results show a substantial performance improvement, achieving a mAP50 of 80.34 and an F1-score of 77.87, significantly outperforming conventional methods. This research underscores the capability of advanced loss function refinements to enhance the robustness and accuracy of road asset detection and segmentation, thereby contributing to improved road safety and infrastructure management.

      <title>Can GPT-O1 Kill All Bugs? An Evaluation of GPT-Family LLMs on QuixBugs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs have long demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in automatic program repair (APR), with OpenAI's ChatGPT being one of the most widely used models in this domain. Through continuous iterations and upgrades of GPT-family models, their performance in fixing bugs has already reached state-of-the-art levels. However, there are few works comparing the effectiveness and variations of different versions of GPT-family models on APR. In this work, inspired by the recent public release of the GPT-o1 models, we conduct the first study to compare the effectiveness of different versions of the GPT-family models in APR. We evaluate the performance of the latest version of the GPT-family models (i.e., O1-preview and O1-mini), GPT-4o, and the historical version of ChatGPT on APR. We conduct an empirical study of the four GPT-family models against other LLMs and APR techniques on the QuixBugs benchmark from multiple evaluation perspectives, including repair success rate, repair cost, response length, and behavior patterns. The results demonstrate that O1's repair capability exceeds that of prior GPT-family models, successfully fixing all 40 bugs in the benchmark. Our work can serve as a foundation for further in-depth exploration of the applications of GPT-family models in APR.</description>

      <title>GlobalMapNet: An Online Framework for Vectorized Global HD Map Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving systems. Traditionally, an expensive and labor-intensive pipeline is implemented to construct HD maps, which is limited in scalability. In recent years, crowdsourcing and online mapping have emerged as two alternative methods, but they have limitations respectively. In this paper, we provide a novel methodology, namely global map construction, to perform direct generation of vectorized global maps, combining the benefits of crowdsourcing and online mapping. We introduce GlobalMapNet, the first online framework for vectorized global HD map construction, which updates and utilizes a global map on the ego vehicle. To generate the global map from scratch, we propose GlobalMapBuilder to match and merge local maps continuously. We design a new algorithm, Map NMS, to remove duplicate map elements and produce a clean map. We also propose GlobalMapFusion to aggregate historical map information, improving consistency of prediction. We examine GlobalMapNet on two widely recognized datasets, Argoverse2 and nuScenes, showing that our framework is capable of generating globally consistent results.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce jina-embeddings-v3, a novel text embedding model with 570 million parameters, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multilingual data and long-context retrieval tasks, supporting context lengths of up to 8192 tokens. The model includes a set of task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters to generate high-quality embeddings for query-document retrieval, clustering, classification, and text matching. Additionally, Matryoshka Representation Learning is integrated into the training process, allowing flexible truncation of embedding dimensions without compromising performance. Evaluation on the MTEB benchmark shows that jina-embeddings-v3 outperforms the latest proprietary embeddings from OpenAI and Cohere on English tasks, while achieving superior performance compared to multilingual-e5-large-instruct across all multilingual tasks.</description>

Abstract: Speech disfluency commonly occurs in conversational and spontaneous speech. However, standard Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models struggle to accurately recognize these disfluencies because they are typically trained on fluent transcripts. Current research mainly focuses on detecting disfluencies within transcripts, overlooking their exact location and duration in the speech. Additionally, previous work often requires model fine-tuning and addresses limited types of disfluencies.
  In this work, we present an inference-only approach to augment any ASR model with the ability to detect open-set disfluencies. We first demonstrate that ASR models have difficulty transcribing speech disfluencies. Next, this work proposes a modified Connectionist Temporal Classification(CTC)-based forced alignment algorithm from \cite{kurzinger2020ctc} to predict word-level timestamps while effectively capturing disfluent speech. Additionally, we develop a model to classify alignment gaps between timestamps as either containing disfluent speech or silence. This model achieves an accuracy of 81.62% and an F1-score of 80.07%. We test the augmentation pipeline of alignment gap detection and classification on a disfluent dataset. Our results show that we captured 74.13% of the words that were initially missed by the transcription, demonstrating the potential of this pipeline for downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Flash STU: Fast Spectral Transform Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper describes an efficient, open source PyTorch implementation of the Spectral Transform Unit. We investigate sequence prediction tasks over several modalities including language, robotics, and simulated dynamical systems. We find that for the same parameter count, the STU and its variants outperform the Transformer as well as other leading state space models across various modalities.</description>
