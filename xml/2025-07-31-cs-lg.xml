      <title>Task-Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall: Making Neural Networks learn like college students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks often suffer from a critical limitation known as Catastrophic Forgetting, where performance on past tasks degrades after learning new ones. This paper introduces a novel continual learning approach inspired by human learning strategies like Active Recall, Deliberate Practice and Spaced Repetition, named Task Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall (TFC-SR). TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay with a mechanism we termed the Active Recall Probe. It is a periodic, task-aware evaluation of the model's memory that stabilizes the representations of past knowledge. We test TFC-SR on the Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading regularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR performs significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split CIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to standard replay's 7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of the probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume. Additionally, we analyze the trade-off between memory size and performance and show that while TFC-SR performs better in memory-constrained environments, higher replay volume is still more effective when available memory is abundant. We conclude that TFC-SR is a robust and efficient approach, highlighting the importance of integrating active memory retrieval mechanisms into continual learning systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry of Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate how Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML) encodes data as quantum geometry. In QCML, features of the data are represented by learned Hermitian matrices, and data points are mapped to states in Hilbert space. The quantum geometry description endows the dataset with rich geometric and topological structure - including intrinsic dimension, quantum metric, and Berry curvature - derived directly from the data. QCML captures global properties of data, while avoiding the curse of dimensionality inherent in local methods. We illustrate this on a number of synthetic and real-world examples. Quantum geometric representation of QCML could advance our understanding of cognitive phenomena within the framework of quantum cognition.</description>

      <title>A Study on Variants of Conventional, Fuzzy, and Nullspace-Based Independence Criteria for Improving Supervised and Unsupervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised and supervised learning methods conventionally use kernels to capture nonlinearities inherent in data structure. However experts have to ensure their proposed nonlinearity maximizes variability and capture inherent diversity of data. We reviewed all independence criteria to design unsupervised learners. Then we proposed 3 independence criteria and used them to design unsupervised and supervised dimensionality reduction methods. We evaluated contrast, accuracy and interpretability of these methods in both linear and neural nonlinear settings. The results show that the methods have outperformed the baseline (tSNE, PCA, regularized LDA, VAE with (un)supervised learner and layer sharing) and opened a new line of interpretable machine learning (ML) for the researchers.</description>

      <title>Advancing Wildfire Risk Prediction via Morphology-Aware Curriculum Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wildfires significantly impact natural ecosystems and human health, leading to biodiversity loss, increased hydrogeological risks, and elevated emissions of toxic substances. Climate change exacerbates these effects, particularly in regions with rising temperatures and prolonged dry periods, such as the Mediterranean. This requires the development of advanced risk management strategies that utilize state-of-the-art technologies. However, in this context, the data show a bias toward an imbalanced setting, where the incidence of wildfire events is significantly lower than typical situations. This imbalance, coupled with the inherent complexity of high-dimensional spatio-temporal data, poses significant challenges for training deep learning architectures. Moreover, since precise wildfire predictions depend mainly on weather data, finding a way to reduce computational costs to enable more frequent updates using the latest weather forecasts would be beneficial. This paper investigates how adopting a contrastive framework can address these challenges through enhanced latent representations for the patch's dynamic features. We thus introduce a new morphology-based curriculum contrastive learning that mitigates issues associated with diverse regional characteristics and enables the use of smaller patch sizes without compromising performance. An experimental analysis is performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling strategies.</description>

      <title>Deep Unfolding for MIMO Signal Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep unfolding neural network-based MIMO detector that incorporates complex-valued computations using Wirtinger calculus. The method, referred as Dynamic Partially Shrinkage Thresholding (DPST), enables efficient, interpretable, and low-complexity MIMO signal detection. Unlike prior approaches that rely on real-valued approximations, our method operates natively in the complex domain, aligning with the fundamental nature of signal processing tasks. The proposed algorithm requires only a small number of trainable parameters, allowing for simplified training. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior detection performance with fewer iterations and lower computational complexity, making it a practical solution for next-generation massive MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Green Energy Integration in Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the implementation of a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-optimized energy management system for e-commerce data centers, aimed at enhancing energy efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. The proposed system leverages DRL algorithms to dynamically manage the integration of renewable energy sources, energy storage, and grid power, adapting to fluctuating energy availability in real time. The study demonstrates that the DRL-optimized system achieves a 38\% reduction in energy costs, significantly outperforming traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods (28\%) and heuristic approaches (22\%). Additionally, it maintains a low SLA violation rate of 1.5\%, compared to 3.0\% for RL and 4.8\% for heuristic methods. The DRL-optimized approach also results in an 82\% improvement in energy efficiency, surpassing other methods, and a 45\% reduction in carbon emissions, making it the most environmentally friendly solution. The system's cumulative reward of 950 reflects its superior performance in balancing multiple objectives. Through rigorous testing and ablation studies, the paper validates the effectiveness of the DRL model's architecture and parameters, offering a robust solution for energy management in data centers. The findings highlight the potential of DRL in advancing energy optimization strategies and addressing sustainability challenges.</description>

      <title>SPADE-S: A Sparsity-Robust Foundational Forecaster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in time series forecasting, accurate modeling of time series with strong heterogeneity in magnitude and/or sparsity patterns remains challenging for state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. We identify several factors that lead existing models to systematically underperform on low-magnitude and sparse time series, including loss functions with implicit biases toward high-magnitude series, training-time sampling methods, and limitations of time series encoding methods.
  SPADE-S is a robust forecasting architecture that significantly reduces magnitude- and sparsity-based systematic biases and improves overall prediction accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that SPADE-S outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across a diverse set of use cases in demand forecasting. In particular, we show that, depending on the quantile forecast and magnitude of the series, SPADE-S can improve forecast accuracy by up to 15%. This results in P90 overall forecast accuracy gains of 2.21%, 6.58%, and 4.28%, and P50 forecast accuracy gains of 0.92%, 0.77%, and 1.95%, respectively, for each of three distinct datasets, ranging from 3 million to 700 million series, from a large online retailer.</description>

      <title>Handling Out-of-Distribution Data: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of Machine Learning (ML) and data-driven applications, one of the significant challenge is the change in data distribution between the training and deployment stages, commonly known as distribution shift. This paper outlines different mechanisms for handling two main types of distribution shifts: (i) Covariate shift: where the value of features or covariates change between train and test data, and (ii) Concept/Semantic-shift: where model experiences shift in the concept learned during training due to emergence of novel classes in the test phase. We sum up our contributions in three folds. First, we formalize distribution shifts, recite on how the conventional method fails to handle them adequately and urge for a model that can simultaneously perform better in all types of distribution shifts. Second, we discuss why handling distribution shifts is important and provide an extensive review of the methods and techniques that have been developed to detect, measure, and mitigate the effects of these shifts. Third, we discuss the current state of distribution shift handling mechanisms and propose future research directions in this area. Overall, we provide a retrospective synopsis of the literature in the distribution shift, focusing on OOD data that had been overlooked in the existing surveys.</description>

      <title>OCSVM-Guided Representation Learning for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to detect anomalies without labeled data, a necessity in many machine learning applications where anomalous samples are rare or not available. Most state-of-the-art methods fall into two categories: reconstruction-based approaches, which often reconstruct anomalies too well, and decoupled representation learning with density estimators, which can suffer from suboptimal feature spaces. While some recent methods attempt to couple feature learning and anomaly detection, they often rely on surrogate objectives, restrict kernel choices, or introduce approximations that limit their expressiveness and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that tightly couples representation learning with an analytically solvable one-class SVM (OCSVM), through a custom loss formulation that directly aligns latent features with the OCSVM decision boundary. The model is evaluated on two tasks: a new benchmark based on MNIST-C, and a challenging brain MRI subtle lesion detection task. Unlike most methods that focus on large, hyperintense lesions at the image level, our approach succeeds to target small, non-hyperintense lesions, while we evaluate voxel-wise metrics, addressing a more clinically relevant scenario. Both experiments evaluate a form of robustness to domain shifts, including corruption types in MNIST-C and scanner/age variations in MRI. Results demonstrate performance and robustness of our proposed mode,highlighting its potential for general UAD and real-world medical imaging applications.

      <title>AGORA: Incentivizing Group Emergence Capability in LLMs via Group Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress in complex reasoning is constrained by the static nature of the current training datasets. We propose structured interaction as a new scaling axis, moving beyond the prevailing paradigm of increasing model parameters. Our self-evolving framework, AGORA, enables a collaborative ensemble to achieve reasoning performance exceeding state-of-the-art monolithic systems by up to 4.45 percentage points on challenging mathematical benchmarks. This gain stems from group emergent ability-the synthesis of collective capabilities unattainable by isolated models, validating interaction as a scalable driver of intelligence. Our results position the engineering of collaborative ecosystems as a vital frontier for capability emergence.</description>

      <title>LLM-Adapted Interpretation Framework for Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background &amp; Aims: High-performance machine learning models like XGBoost are often "black boxes," limiting their clinical adoption due to a lack of interpretability. This study aims to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and narrative transparency for sarcopenia risk assessment. Methods: We propose the LLM-Adapted Interpretation Framework (LAI-ML), a novel knowledge distillation architecture. LAI-ML transforms feature attributions from a trained XGBoost model into a probabilistic format using specialized techniques (HAGA and CACS). A Large Language Model (LLM), guided by a reinforcement learning loop and case-based retrieval, then generates data-faithful diagnostic narratives. Results: The LAI-ML framework achieved 83% prediction accuracy, significantly outperforming the baseline XGBoost model, 13% higher. Notably, the LLM not only replicated the teacher model's logic but also corrected its predictions in 21.7% of discordant cases, demonstrating enhanced reasoning. Conclusion: LAI-ML effectively translates opaque model predictions into trustworthy and interpretable clinical insights, offering a deployable solution to the "black-box" problem in medical AI.</description>

      <title>MaPPO: Maximum a Posteriori Preference Optimization with Prior Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the era of large language models (LLMs) on behalf of users unfolds, Preference Optimization (PO) methods have become a central approach to aligning LLMs with human preferences and improving performance. We propose Maximum a Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from preferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the optimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating prior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective. This not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by mitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More importantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports preference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO can be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including widely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO. Extensive empirical evaluations of different model sizes and model series on three standard benchmarks, including MT-Bench, AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard, demonstrate consistent improvements in alignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>EvoSLD: Automated Neural Scaling Law Discovery With Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling laws are fundamental mathematical relationships that predict how neural network performance evolves with changes in variables such as model size, dataset size, and computational resources. Traditionally, discovering these laws requires extensive human expertise and manual experimentation. We introduce EvoSLD, an automated framework for Scaling Law Discovery (SLD) that leverages evolutionary algorithms guided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to co-evolve symbolic expressions and their optimization routines. Formulated to handle scaling variables, control variables, and response metrics across diverse experimental settings, EvoSLD searches for parsimonious, universal functional forms that minimize fitting errors on grouped data subsets. Evaluated on five real-world scenarios from recent literature, EvoSLD rediscovers exact human-derived laws in two cases and surpasses them in others, achieving up to orders-of-magnitude reductions in normalized mean squared error on held-out test sets. Compared to baselines like symbolic regression and ablated variants, EvoSLD demonstrates superior accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency, highlighting its potential to accelerate AI research.

      <title>Embeddings to Diagnosis: Latent Fragility under Agentic Perturbations in Clinical LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs for clinical decision support often fail under small but clinically meaningful input shifts such as masking a symptom or negating a finding, despite high performance on static benchmarks. These reasoning failures frequently go undetected by standard NLP metrics, which are insensitive to latent representation shifts that drive diagnosis instability. We propose a geometry-aware evaluation framework, LAPD (Latent Agentic Perturbation Diagnostics), which systematically probes the latent robustness of clinical LLMs under structured adversarial edits. Within this framework, we introduce Latent Diagnosis Flip Rate (LDFR), a model-agnostic diagnostic signal that captures representational instability when embeddings cross decision boundaries in PCA-reduced latent space. Clinical notes are generated using a structured prompting pipeline grounded in diagnostic reasoning, then perturbed along four axes: masking, negation, synonym replacement, and numeric variation to simulate common ambiguities and omissions. We compute LDFR across both foundation and clinical LLMs, finding that latent fragility emerges even under minimal surface-level changes. Finally, we validate our findings on 90 real clinical notes from the DiReCT benchmark (MIMIC-IV), confirming the generalizability of LDFR beyond synthetic settings. Our results reveal a persistent gap between surface robustness and semantic stability, underscoring the importance of geometry-aware auditing in safety-critical clinical AI.</description>

      <title>Operator-Based Machine Intelligence: A Hilbert Space Framework for Spectral Learning and Symbolic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional machine learning models, particularly neural networks, are rooted in finite-dimensional parameter spaces and nonlinear function approximations. This report explores an alternative formulation where learning tasks are expressed as sampling and computation in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, leveraging tools from functional analysis, signal processing, and spectral theory. We review foundational concepts such as Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS), spectral operator learning, and wavelet-domain representations. We present a rigorous mathematical formulation of learning in Hilbert spaces, highlight recent models based on scattering transforms and Koopman operators, and discuss advantages and limitations relative to conventional neural architectures. The report concludes by outlining directions for scalable and interpretable machine learning grounded in Hilbertian signal processing.</description>

      <title>Beyond Neural Networks: Symbolic Reasoning over Wavelet Logic Graph Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully non neural learning framework based on Graph Laplacian Wavelet Transforms (GLWT). Unlike traditional architectures that rely on convolutional, recurrent, or attention based neural networks, our model operates purely in the graph spectral domain using structured multiscale filtering, nonlinear shrinkage, and symbolic logic over wavelet coefficients. Signals defined on graph nodes are decomposed via GLWT, modulated with interpretable nonlinearities, and recombined for downstream tasks such as denoising and token classification. The system supports compositional reasoning through a symbolic domain-specific language (DSL) over graph wavelet activations. Experiments on synthetic graph denoising and linguistic token graphs demonstrate competitive performance against lightweight GNNs with far greater transparency and efficiency. This work proposes a principled, interpretable, and resource-efficient alternative to deep neural architectures for learning on graphs.</description>

      <title>Exploring Adaptive Structure Learning for Heterophilic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) gained traction for graph representation learning, with recent attention on improving performance on heterophilic graphs for various real-world applications. The localized feature aggregation in a typical message-passing paradigm hinders the capturing of long-range dependencies between non-local nodes of the same class. The inherent connectivity structure in heterophilic graphs often conflicts with information sharing between distant nodes of same class. We propose structure learning to rewire edges in shallow GCNs itself to avoid performance degradation in downstream discriminative tasks due to oversmoothing. Parameterizing the adjacency matrix to learn connections between non-local nodes and extend the hop span of shallow GCNs facilitates the capturing of long-range dependencies. However, our method is not generalizable across heterophilic graphs and performs inconsistently on node classification task contingent to the graph structure.</description>

      <title>EdgeAgentX-DT: Integrating Digital Twins and Generative AI for Resilient Edge Intelligence in Tactical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce EdgeAgentX-DT, an advanced extension of the EdgeAgentX framework that integrates digital twin simulations and generative AI-driven scenario training to significantly enhance edge intelligence in military networks. EdgeAgentX-DT utilizes network digital twins, virtual replicas synchronized with real-world edge devices, to provide a secure, realistic environment for training and validation. Leveraging generative AI methods, such as diffusion models and transformers, the system creates diverse and adversarial scenarios for robust simulation-based agent training. Our multi-layer architecture includes: (1) on-device edge intelligence; (2) digital twin synchronization; and (3) generative scenario training. Experimental simulations demonstrate notable improvements over EdgeAgentX, including faster learning convergence, higher network throughput, reduced latency, and improved resilience against jamming and node failures. A case study involving a complex tactical scenario with simultaneous jamming attacks, agent failures, and increased network loads illustrates how EdgeAgentX-DT sustains operational performance, whereas baseline methods fail. These results highlight the potential of digital-twin-enabled generative training to strengthen edge AI deployments in contested environments.</description>

      <title>AdaptHetero: Machine Learning Interpretation-Driven Subgroup Adaptation for EHR-Based Clinical Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interpretation has primarily been leveraged to build clinician trust and uncover actionable insights in EHRs. However, the intrinsic complexity and heterogeneity of EHR data limit its effectiveness in guiding subgroup-specific modeling. We propose AdaptHetero, a novel MLI-driven framework that transforms interpretability insights into actionable guidance for tailoring model training and evaluation across subpopulations within individual hospital systems. Evaluated on three large-scale EHR datasets - GOSSIS-1-eICU, WiDS, and MIMIC-IV - AdaptHetero consistently identifies heterogeneous model behaviors in predicting ICU mortality, in-hospital death, and hidden hypoxemia. By integrating SHAP-based interpretation and unsupervised clustering, the framework enhances the identification of clinically meaningful subgroup-specific characteristics, leading to improved predictive performance.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Gradient Inversion Risks in Practical Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gradient inversion attack has been demonstrated as a significant privacy threat to federated learning (FL), particularly in continuous domains such as vision models. In contrast, it is often considered less effective or highly dependent on impractical training settings when applied to language models, due to the challenges posed by the discrete nature of tokens in text data. As a result, its potential privacy threats remain largely underestimated, despite FL being an emerging training method for language models. In this work, we propose a domain-specific gradient inversion attack named Grab (gradient inversion with hybrid optimization). Grab features two alternating optimization processes to address the challenges caused by practical training settings, including a simultaneous optimization on dropout masks between layers for improved token recovery and a discrete optimization for effective token sequencing. Grab can recover a significant portion (up to 92.9% recovery rate) of the private training data, outperforming the attack strategy of utilizing discrete optimization with an auxiliary model by notable improvements of up to 28.9% recovery rate in benchmark settings and 48.5% recovery rate in practical settings. Grab provides a valuable step forward in understanding this privacy threat in the emerging FL training mode of language models.</description>

      <title>Advancing Compositional LLM Reasoning with Structured Task Relations in Interactive Multimodal Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive multimodal applications (IMAs), such as route planning in the Internet of Vehicles, enrich users' personalized experiences by integrating various forms of data over wireless networks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple IMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents different business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on multiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes various IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two primary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA objectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in resource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we propose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich structured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We partition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to facilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning procedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking phases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better adaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks. For the second challenge, we introduce ContextGear, a scheduling strategy to optimize the training procedure of ContextLoRA, aiming to minimize computational and communication costs through a strategic grouping mechanism. Experiments on three benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed ContextLoRA and ContextGear. Furthermore, we prototype our proposed paradigm on a real-world wireless testbed, demonstrating its practical applicability for various IMAs. We will release our code to the community.</description>

      <title>Learning from Limited and Imperfect Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of data in the world (eg, internet, etc.) significantly differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used for learning from imperfect datasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. To expand the use of deep models, it is essential to overcome the labor-intensive curation process by developing robust algorithms that can learn from diverse, real-world data distributions. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep Neural Networks which can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the real world. This thesis is divided into four segments, each covering a scenario of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the thesis focuses on Learning Generative Models from Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate the mode-collapse and enable diverse aesthetic image generations for tail (minority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes to generalize as effectively as the head classes without requiring explicit generation of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing Relevant Metrics for learning from long-tailed data with limited annotation (semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part, which focuses on the Efficient Domain Adaptation of the model to various domains with very few to zero labeled samples.</description>

      <title>Bubbleformer: Forecasting Boiling with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling boiling (an inherently chaotic, multiphase process central to energy and thermal systems) remains a significant challenge for neural PDE surrogates. Existing models require future input (e.g., bubble positions) during inference because they fail to learn nucleation from past states, limiting their ability to autonomously forecast boiling dynamics. They also fail to model flow boiling velocity fields, where sharp interface-momentum coupling demands long-range and directional inductive biases. We introduce Bubbleformer, a transformer-based spatiotemporal model that forecasts stable and long-range boiling dynamics including nucleation, interface evolution, and heat transfer without dependence on simulation data during inference. Bubbleformer integrates factorized axial attention, frequency-aware scaling, and conditions on thermophysical parameters to generalize across fluids, geometries, and operating conditions. To evaluate physical fidelity in chaotic systems, we propose interpretable physics-based metrics that evaluate heat-flux consistency, interface geometry, and mass conservation. We also release BubbleML 2.0, a high-fidelity dataset that spans diverse working fluids (cryogens, refrigerants, dielectrics), boiling configurations (pool and flow boiling), flow regimes (bubbly, slug, annular), and boundary conditions. Bubbleformer sets new benchmark results in both prediction and forecasting of two-phase boiling flows.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Multimodal Protein Plug-and-Play with Diffusion-Based Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an inverse problem, the goal is to recover an unknown parameter (e.g., an image) that has typically undergone some lossy or noisy transformation during measurement. Recently, deep generative models, particularly diffusion models, have emerged as powerful priors for protein structure generation. However, integrating noisy experimental data from multiple sources to guide these models remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often require precise knowledge of experimental noise levels and manually tuned weights for each data modality. In this work, we introduce Adam-PnP, a Plug-and-Play framework that guides a pre-trained protein diffusion model using gradients from multiple, heterogeneous experimental sources. Our framework features an adaptive noise estimation scheme and a dynamic modality weighting mechanism integrated into the diffusion process, which reduce the need for manual hyperparameter tuning. Experiments on complex reconstruction tasks demonstrate significantly improved accuracy using Adam-PnP.</description>

      <title>Deep Polynomial Chaos Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is a classical and widely used surrogate modeling technique in physical simulation and uncertainty quantification. By taking a linear combination of a set of basis polynomials - orthonormal with respect to the distribution of uncertain input parameters - PCE enables tractable inference of key statistical quantities, such as (conditional) means, variances, covariances, and Sobol sensitivity indices, which are essential for understanding the modeled system and identifying influential parameters and their interactions. As the number of basis functions grows exponentially with the number of parameters, PCE does not scale well to high-dimensional problems. We address this challenge by combining PCE with ideas from probabilistic circuits, resulting in the deep polynomial chaos expansion (DeepPCE) - a deep generalization of PCE that scales effectively to high-dimensional input spaces. DeepPCE achieves predictive performance comparable to that of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), while retaining PCE's ability to compute exact statistical inferences via simple forward passes.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Diverse and Novel Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recommendation systems, diversity and novelty are essential for capturing varied user preferences and encouraging exploration, yet many systems prioritize click relevance. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored to improve diversity, it often depends on random exploration that may not align with user interests. We propose LAAC (LLM-guided Adversarial Actor Critic), a novel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) as reference policies to suggest novel items, while training a lightweight policy to refine these suggestions using system-specific data. The method formulates training as a bilevel optimization between actor and critic networks, enabling the critic to selectively favor promising novel actions and the actor to improve its policy beyond LLM recommendations. To mitigate overestimation of unreliable LLM suggestions, we apply regularization that anchors critic values for unexplored items close to well-estimated dataset actions. Experiments on real-world datasets show that LAAC outperforms existing baselines in diversity, novelty, and accuracy, while remaining robust on imbalanced data, effectively integrating LLM knowledge without expensive fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Blending data and physics for reduced-order modeling of systems with spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While data-driven techniques are powerful tools for reduced-order modeling of systems with chaotic dynamics, great potential remains for leveraging known physics (i.e. a full-order model (FOM)) to improve predictive capability. We develop a hybrid reduced order model (ROM), informed by both data and FOM, for evolving spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics on an invariant manifold whose coordinates are found using an autoencoder. This approach projects the vector field of the FOM onto the invariant manifold; then, this physics-derived vector field is either corrected using dynamic data, or used as a Bayesian prior that is updated with data. In both cases, the neural ordinary differential equation approach is used. We consider simulated data from the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and complex Ginzburg-Landau equations. Relative to the data-only approach, for scenarios of abundant data, scarce data, and even an incorrect FOM (i.e. erroneous parameter values), the hybrid approach yields substantially improved time-series predictions.</description>

      <title>DEM-NeRF: A Neuro-Symbolic Method for Scientific Discovery through Physics-Informed Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling physical systems, offering the ability to learn complex representations from limited data while integrating foundational scientific knowledge. In particular, neuro-symbolic approaches that combine data-driven learning, the neuro, with symbolic equations and rules, the symbolic, address the tension between methods that are purely empirical, which risk straying from established physical principles, and traditional numerical solvers that demand complete geometric knowledge and can be prohibitively expensive for high-fidelity simulations. In this work, we present a novel neuro-symbolic framework for reconstructing and simulating elastic objects directly from sparse multi-view image sequences, without requiring explicit geometric information. Specifically, we integrate a neural radiance field (NeRF) for object reconstruction with physics-informed neural networks (PINN) that incorporate the governing partial differential equations of elasticity. In doing so, our method learns a spatiotemporal representation of deforming objects that leverages both image supervision and symbolic physical constraints. To handle complex boundary and initial conditions, which are traditionally confronted using finite element methods, boundary element methods, or sensor-based measurements, we employ an energy-constrained Physics-Informed Neural Network architecture. This design enhances both simulation accuracy and the explainability of results.</description>

      <title>A Contrastive Diffusion-based Network (CDNet) for Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models are widely used for time series classification (TSC) due to their scalability and efficiency. However, their performance degrades under challenging data conditions such as class similarity, multimodal distributions, and noise. To address these limitations, we propose CDNet, a Contrastive Diffusion-based Network that enhances existing classifiers by generating informative positive and negative samples via a learned diffusion process. Unlike traditional diffusion models that denoise individual samples, CDNet learns transitions between samples--both within and across classes--through convolutional approximations of reverse diffusion steps. We introduce a theoretically grounded CNN-based mechanism to enable both denoising and mode coverage, and incorporate an uncertainty-weighted composite loss for robust training. Extensive experiments on the UCR Archive and simulated datasets demonstrate that CDNet significantly improves state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning classifiers, particularly under noisy, similar, and multimodal conditions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Neural Combinatorial Optimization Solver for the Min-max Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) solvers have been proposed to address Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). However, most of these solvers focus exclusively on single-vehicle VRP variants, overlooking the more realistic min-max Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MMHCVRP), which involves multiple vehicles. Existing MMHCVRP solvers typically select a vehicle and its next node to visit at each decoding step, but often make myopic decoding decisions and overlook key properties of MMHCVRP, including local topological relationships, vehicle permutation invariance, and node symmetry, resulting in suboptimal performance. To better address these limitations, we propose ECHO, an efficient NCO solver. First, ECHO exploits the proposed dual-modality node encoder to capture local topological relationships among nodes. Subsequently, to mitigate myopic decisions, ECHO employs the proposed Parameter-Free Cross-Attention mechanism to prioritize the vehicle selected in the preceding decoding step. Finally, leveraging vehicle permutation invariance and node symmetry, we introduce a tailored data augment strategy for MMHCVRP to stabilize the Reinforcement Learning training process. To assess the performance of ECHO, we conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that ECHO outperforms state-of-the-art NCO solvers across varying numbers of vehicles and nodes, and exhibits well-performing generalization across both scales and distribution patterns. Finally, ablation studies validate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Systolic Array-based Accelerator for State-Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequence modeling is crucial for AI to understand temporal data and detect complex time-dependent patterns. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformers have advanced in capturing long-range dependencies, they struggle with achieving high accuracy with very long sequences due to limited memory retention (fixed context window). State-Space Models (SSMs) leverage exponentially decaying memory enabling lengthy context window and so they process very long data sequences more efficiently than recurrent and Transformer-based models. Unlike traditional neural models like CNNs and RNNs, SSM-based models require solving differential equations through continuous integration, making training and inference both compute- and memory-intensive on conventional CPUs and GPUs. In this paper we introduce a specialized hardware accelerator, EpochCore, for accelerating SSMs. EpochCore is based on systolic arrays (SAs) and is designed to enhance the energy efficiency and throughput of inference of SSM-based models for long-range sequence tasks. Within the SA, we propose a versatile processing element (PE) called LIMA-PE to perform traditional and specialized MAC operations to support traditional DNNs and SSMs. To complement the EpochCore microarchitecture, we propose a novel dataflow, ProDF, which enables highly efficient execution of SSM-based models. By leveraging the LIMA-PE microarchitecture and ProDF, EpochCore achieves on average 250x gains in performance and 45x improvement in energy efficiency, at the expense of 2x increase in area cost over traditional SA-based accelerators, and around ~2,000x improvement in latency/inference on LRA datasets compared to GPU kernel operations.</description>

      <title>Enabling Pareto-Stationarity Exploration in Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning: A Multi-Objective Weighted-Chebyshev Actor-Critic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) applications, being able to systematically explore the Pareto-stationary solutions under multiple non-convex reward objectives with theoretical finite-time sample complexity guarantee is an important and yet under-explored problem. This motivates us to take the first step and fill the important gap in MORL. Specifically, in this paper, we propose a \uline{M}ulti-\uline{O}bjective weighted-\uline{CH}ebyshev \uline{A}ctor-critic (MOCHA) algorithm for MORL, which judiciously integrates the weighted-Chebychev (WC) and actor-critic framework to enable Pareto-stationarity exploration systematically with finite-time sample complexity guarantee. Sample complexity result of MOCHA algorithm reveals an interesting dependency on $p_{\min}$ in finding an $\epsilon$-Pareto-stationary solution, where $p_{\min}$ denotes the minimum entry of a given weight vector $\mathbf{p}$ in WC-scarlarization. By carefully choosing learning rates, the sample complexity for each exploration can be $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Furthermore, simulation studies on a large KuaiRand offline dataset, show that the performance of MOCHA algorithm significantly outperforms other baseline MORL approaches.</description>

      <title>Data Leakage and Redundancy in the LIT-PCBA Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LIT-PCBA is a widely used benchmark for virtual screening, but our audit reveals it is fundamentally compromised. The dataset suffers from egregious data leakage, rampant duplication, and pervasive analog redundancy -- flaws that invalidate its use for fair model evaluation. Notably, we identify 2,491 inactives duplicated across training and validation sets, and thousands more repeated within individual data splits (2,945 in training, 789 in validation). Critically, three ligands in the query set -- meant to represent unseen test cases -- are leaked: two appear in the training set, one in validation. Structural redundancy compounds these issues: for some targets, over 80% of query ligands are near duplicates, with Tanimoto similarity &gt;= 0.9. In ALDH1 alone, we find 323 highly similar active pairs between training and validation sets, invalidating claims of chemical diversity. These and other flaws collectively cause models trained on LIT-PCBA to memorize rather than generalize. To demonstrate the consequences of these data integrity failures, we implement a trivial memorization-based baseline -- using no learning, no physics, and no modeling -- that outperforms state-of-the-art models, including deep neural networks like CHEESE, on LIT-PCBA simply by exploiting these artifacts. Our findings render the benchmark unfit for its intended purpose and call into question previous results based on its use. We share this audit to raise awareness and provide tooling to help the community develop more rigorous and reliable datasets going forward. All scripts necessary to reproduce our audit and the baseline implementation are available at: https://github.com/sievestack/LIT-PCBA-audit</description>

      <title>Torque-based Graph Surgery:Enhancing Graph Neural Networks with Hierarchical Rewiring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data, leveraging message passing to diffuse information and update node representations. However, most efforts have suggested that native interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process, motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to improve representation learning in heterophilous graphs and enhance robustness against noisy graphs. Specifically, we define an interference-aware torque metric that integrates structural distance and energy scores to quantify the perturbation induced by edges, thereby encouraging each node to aggregate information from its nearest low-energy neighbors. We use the metric to hierarchically reconfigure the receptive field of each layer by judiciously pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing propagation noise and boosting pertinent signals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both heterophilous and homophilous graphs, and maintains high accuracy on noisy graph.</description>

      <title>MemShare: Memory Efficient Inference for Large Reasoning Models through KV Cache Reuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved significant advances in mathematical reasoning and formal logic tasks. However, their tendency to generate lengthy chain-of-thought sequences leads to substantial memory overhead during inference. We observe that LRMs frequently produce highly similar intermediate reasoning steps, which correspond to similar KV cache states across layers. Motivated by this observation, we propose MemShare, a novel KV cache management approach that effectively reduces memory overhead. MemShare employs a collaborative filtering algorithm to efficiently identify reusable KV cache blocks and enables zero copy cache reuse to significantly reduce memory overhead, improve throughput while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that MemShare delivers up to 84.79\% improvement in throughput while maintaining better accuracy compared to existing KV cache management methods.</description>

      <title>PVD-ONet: A Multi-scale Neural Operator Method for Singularly Perturbed Boundary Layer Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks and Physics-informed DeepONet excel in solving partial differential equations; however, they often fail to converge for singularly perturbed problems. To address this, we propose two novel frameworks, Prandtl-Van Dyke neural network (PVD-Net) and its operator learning extension Prandtl-Van Dyke Deep Operator Network (PVD-ONet), which rely solely on governing equations without data. To address varying task-specific requirements, both PVD-Net and PVD-ONet are developed in two distinct versions, tailored respectively for stability-focused and high-accuracy modeling. The leading-order PVD-Net adopts a two-network architecture combined with Prandtl's matching condition, targeting stability-prioritized scenarios. The high-order PVD-Net employs a five-network design with Van Dyke's matching principle to capture fine-scale boundary layer structures, making it ideal for high-accuracy scenarios. PVD-ONet generalizes PVD-Net to the operator learning setting by assembling multiple DeepONet modules, directly mapping initial conditions to solution operators and enabling instant predictions for an entire family of boundary layer problems without retraining. Numerical experiments on various models show that our proposed methods consistently outperform existing baselines under various error metrics, thereby offering a powerful new approach for multi-scale problems.</description>

      <title>Retrieve-Augmented Generation for Speeding up Diffusion Policy without Additional Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Policies (DPs) have attracted attention for their ability to achieve significant accuracy improvements in various imitation learning tasks. However, DPs depend on Diffusion Models, which require multiple noise removal steps to generate a single action, resulting in long generation times. To solve this problem, knowledge distillation-based methods such as Consistency Policy (CP) have been proposed. However, these methods require a significant amount of training time, especially for difficult tasks. In this study, we propose RAGDP (Retrieve-Augmented Generation for Diffusion Policies) as a novel framework that eliminates the need for additional training using a knowledge base to expedite the inference of pre-trained DPs. In concrete, RAGDP encodes observation-action pairs through the DP encoder to construct a vector database of expert demonstrations. During inference, the current observation is embedded, and the most similar expert action is extracted. This extracted action is combined with an intermediate noise removal step to reduce the number of steps required compared to the original diffusion step. We show that by using RAGDP with the base model and existing acceleration methods, we improve the accuracy and speed trade-off with no additional training. Even when accelerating the models 20 times, RAGDP maintains an advantage in accuracy, with a 7% increase over distillation models such as CP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any agents we can possibly build are subject to capacity constraints, as memory and compute resources are inherently finite. However, comparatively little attention has been dedicated to understanding how agents with limited capacity should allocate their resources for optimal performance. The goal of this paper is to shed some light on this question by studying a simple yet relevant continual learning problem: the capacity-constrained linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) sequential prediction problem. We derive a solution to this problem under appropriate technical conditions. Moreover, for problems that can be decomposed into a set of sub-problems, we also demonstrate how to optimally allocate capacity across these sub-problems in the steady state. We view the results of this paper as a first step in the systematic theoretical study of learning under capacity constraints.</description>

      <title>Latte: Collaborative Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models has gained increasing attention for addressing distribution shifts during testing. Among these approaches, memory-based algorithms stand out due to their training-free nature and ability to leverage historical test data. However, existing test-time adaptation methods are typically designed for a single domain with abundant data. In decentralized settings such as federated learning, applying these methods individually to each client suffers from limited test data, while directly sharing a single global memory via the server prevents proper personalization to each client's unique distribution. To address this, we propose Latte, a novel framework where each client maintains a local memory to store embeddings from its own historical test data and an external memory to store class prototypes from other relevant clients. During communication, each client retrieves prototypes from similar clients under the server's coordination to expand its memory. For local adaptation, Latte utilizes both embedding similarity and uncertainty to enhance model performance. Our theoretical analysis shows that Latte effectively leverages in-distribution clients while remaining robust to out-of-distribution clients. Extensive experiments on domain adaptation and corruption benchmarks validate that Latte achieves superior performance in decentralized settings, while introducing only negligible communication and computation costs.

      <title>Evaluation and Benchmarking of LLM Agents: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of LLM-based agents has opened new frontiers in AI applications, yet evaluating these agents remains a complex and underdeveloped area. This survey provides an in-depth overview of the emerging field of LLM agent evaluation, introducing a two-dimensional taxonomy that organizes existing work along (1) evaluation objectives -- what to evaluate, such as agent behavior, capabilities, reliability, and safety -- and (2) evaluation process -- how to evaluate, including interaction modes, datasets and benchmarks, metric computation methods, and tooling. In addition to taxonomy, we highlight enterprise-specific challenges, such as role-based access to data, the need for reliability guarantees, dynamic and long-horizon interactions, and compliance, which are often overlooked in current research. We also identify future research directions, including holistic, more realistic, and scalable evaluation. This work aims to bring clarity to the fragmented landscape of agent evaluation and provide a framework for systematic assessment, enabling researchers and practitioners to evaluate LLM agents for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Stochastic Differential Equation Models for Latent Manifold Learning in Neural Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manifold hypothesis suggests that high-dimensional neural time series lie on a low-dimensional manifold shaped by simpler underlying dynamics. To uncover this structure, latent dynamical variable models such as state-space models, recurrent neural networks, neural ordinary differential equations, and Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models are widely used. We propose a novel hierarchical stochastic differential equation (SDE) model that balances computational efficiency and interpretability, addressing key limitations of existing methods. Our model assumes the trajectory of a manifold can be reconstructed from a sparse set of samples from the manifold trajectory. The latent space is modeled using Brownian bridge SDEs, with points - specified in both time and value - sampled from a multivariate marked point process. These Brownian bridges define the drift of a second set of SDEs, which are then mapped to the observed data. This yields a continuous, differentiable latent process capable of modeling arbitrarily complex time series as the number of manifold points increases. We derive training and inference procedures and show that the computational cost of inference scales linearly with the length of the observation data. We then validate our model on both synthetic data and neural recordings to demonstrate that it accurately recovers the underlying manifold structure and scales effectively with data dimensionality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the effectiveness of using a simple neural network output, a categorical probability distribution, for the task of next spike prediction. This case study motivates an investigation into why this simple output structure is not commonly used with neural temporal point process models. We find evidence that many existing datasets for evaluating temporal point process models do not reveal much information about the underlying event generating processes, and many existing models perform well due to regularization effects of model size and constraints on output structure. We extend existing datasets and create new ones in order to explore outside of this information limited regime and find that outputting a simple categorical distribution is competitive across a wide range of datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current approaches to genomic sequence modeling often struggle to align the inductive biases of machine learning models with the evolutionarily-informed structure of biological systems. To this end, we formulate a novel application of hyperbolic CNNs that exploits this structure, enabling more expressive DNA sequence representations. Our strategy circumvents the need for explicit phylogenetic mapping while discerning key properties of sequences pertaining to core functional and regulatory behavior. Across 37 out of 42 genome interpretation benchmark datasets, our hyperbolic models outperform their Euclidean equivalents. Notably, our approach even surpasses state-of-the-art performance on seven GUE benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming many DNA language models while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters and avoiding pretraining. Our results include a novel set of benchmark datasets--the Transposable Elements Benchmark--which explores a major but understudied component of the genome with deep evolutionary significance. We further motivate our work by exploring how our hyperbolic models recognize genomic signal under various data-generating conditions and by constructing an empirical method for interpreting the hyperbolicity of dataset embeddings. Throughout these assessments, we find persistent evidence highlighting the potential of our hyperbolic framework as a robust paradigm for genome representation learning. Our code and benchmark datasets are available at https://github.com/rrkhan/HGE.</description>

      <title>DGP: A Dual-Granularity Prompting Framework for Fraud Detection with Graph-Enhanced LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world fraud detection applications benefit from graph learning techniques that jointly exploit node features, often rich in textual data, and graph structural information. Recently, Graph-Enhanced LLMs emerge as a promising graph learning approach that converts graph information into prompts, exploiting LLMs' ability to reason over both textual and structural information. Among them, text-only prompting, which converts graph information to prompts consisting solely of text tokens, offers a solution that relies only on LLM tuning without requiring additional graph-specific encoders. However, text-only prompting struggles on heterogeneous fraud-detection graphs: multi-hop relations expand exponentially with each additional hop, leading to rapidly growing neighborhoods associated with dense textual information. These neighborhoods may overwhelm the model with long, irrelevant content in the prompt and suppress key signals from the target node, thereby degrading performance. To address this challenge, we propose Dual Granularity Prompting (DGP), which mitigates information overload by preserving fine-grained textual details for the target node while summarizing neighbor information into coarse-grained text prompts. DGP introduces tailored summarization strategies for different data modalities, bi-level semantic abstraction for textual fields and statistical aggregation for numerical features, enabling effective compression of verbose neighbor content into concise, informative prompts. Experiments across public and industrial datasets demonstrate that DGP operates within a manageable token budget while improving fraud detection performance by up to 6.8% (AUPRC) over state-of-the-art methods, showing the potential of Graph-Enhanced LLMs for fraud detection.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Consistency in Machine Learning and Its Connection to Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is often viewed as a powerful data analysis tool that is easy to learn because of its black-box nature. Yet this very nature also makes it difficult to quantify confidence in predictions extracted from ML models, and more fundamentally, to understand how such models are mathematical abstractions of training data. The goal of this paper is to unravel these issues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a line of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e. the fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we analyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of classification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are equivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying the properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their boundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By parameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that they satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be used to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets. Moreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the multiclass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the class assignments. In the multiclass case, we use these results to deduce normalization and self-consistency conditions, the latter being equivalent to the law of total probability for classifiers. We also show that these are necessary conditions for arbitrary ML models to have valid probabilistic interpretations. Throughout we demonstrate how this analysis informs the broader task of UQ for ML via an uncertainty propagation framework.</description>

      <title>PREIG: Physics-informed and Reinforcement-driven Interpretable GRU for Commodity Demand Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately forecasting commodity demand remains a critical challenge due to volatile market dynamics, nonlinear dependencies, and the need for economically consistent predictions. This paper introduces PREIG, a novel deep learning framework tailored for commodity demand forecasting. The model uniquely integrates a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture with physics-informed neural network (PINN) principles by embedding a domain-specific economic constraint: the negative elasticity between price and demand. This constraint is enforced through a customized loss function that penalizes violations of the physical rule, ensuring that model predictions remain interpretable and aligned with economic theory. To further enhance predictive performance and stability, PREIG incorporates a hybrid optimization strategy that couples NAdam and L-BFGS with Population-Based Training (POP). Experiments across multiple commodities datasets demonstrate that PREIG significantly outperforms traditional econometric models (ARIMA,GARCH) and deep learning baselines (BPNN,RNN) in both RMSE and MAPE. When compared with GRU,PREIG maintains good explainability while still performing well in prediction. By bridging domain knowledge, optimization theory and deep learning, PREIG provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable solution for high-dimensional nonlinear time series forecasting in economy.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Extended Corresponding State Approach for Residual Property Prediction of Hydrofluoroolefins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrofluoroolefins are considered the most promising next-generation refrigerants due to their extremely low global warming potential values, which can effectively mitigate the global warming effect. However, the lack of reliable thermodynamic data hinders the discovery and application of newer and superior hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. In this work, integrating the strengths of theoretical method and data-driven method, we proposed a neural network extended corresponding state model to predict the residual thermodynamic properties of hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. The innovation is that the fluids are characterized through their microscopic molecular structures by the inclusion of graph neural network module and the specialized design of model architecture to enhance its generalization ability. The proposed model is trained using the highly accurate data of available known fluids, and evaluated via the leave-one-out cross-validation method. Compared to conventional extended corresponding state models or cubic equation of state, the proposed model shows significantly improved accuracy for density and energy properties in liquid and supercritical regions, with average absolute deviation of 1.49% (liquid) and 2.42% (supercritical) for density, 3.37% and 2.50% for residual entropy, 1.85% and 1.34% for residual enthalpy. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of embedding physics knowledge into the machine learning model. The proposed neural network extended corresponding state model is expected to significantly accelerate the discovery of novel hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Machine Unlearning with Proxy Adversarial Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific samples from a trained model. A key challenge in this process is over-unlearning, where the model's performance on the remaining data significantly drops due to the change in the model's parameters. Existing unlearning algorithms depend on the remaining data to prevent this issue. As such, these methods are inapplicable in a more practical scenario, where only the unlearning samples are available (i.e., zero-shot unlearning). This paper presents a novel framework, ZS-PAG, to fill this gap. Our approach offers three key innovations: (1) we approximate the inaccessible remaining data by generating adversarial samples; (2) leveraging the generated samples, we pinpoint a specific subspace to perform the unlearning process, therefore preventing over-unlearning in the challenging zero-shot scenario; and (3) we consider the influence of the unlearning process on the remaining samples and design an influence-based pseudo-labeling strategy. As a result, our method further improves the model's performance after unlearning. The proposed method holds a theoretical guarantee, and experiments on various benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method over several baselines.</description>

      <title>evoxels: A differentiable physics framework for voxel-based microstructure simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials science inherently spans disciplines: experimentalists use advanced microscopy to uncover micro- and nanoscale structure, while theorists and computational scientists develop models that link processing, structure, and properties. Bridging these domains is essential for inverse material design where you start from desired performance and work backwards to optimal microstructures and manufacturing routes. Integrating high-resolution imaging with predictive simulations and data-driven optimization accelerates discovery and deepens understanding of process-structure-property relationships. The differentiable physics framework evoxels is based on a fully Pythonic, unified voxel-based approach that integrates segmented 3D microscopy data, physical simulations, inverse modeling, and machine learning.</description>

      <title>TempRe: Template generation for single and direct multi-step retrosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21762v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning remains a central challenge in molecular discovery due to the vast and complex chemical reaction space. While traditional template-based methods offer tractability, they suffer from poor scalability and limited generalization, and template-free generative approaches risk generating invalid reactions. In this work, we propose TempRe, a generative framework that reformulates template-based approaches as sequence generation, enabling scalable, flexible, and chemically plausible retrosynthesis. We evaluated TempRe across single-step and multi-step retrosynthesis tasks, demonstrating its superiority over both template classification and SMILES-based generation methods. On the PaRoutes multi-step benchmark, TempRe achieves strong top-k route accuracy. Furthermore, we extend TempRe to direct multi-step synthesis route generation, providing a lightweight and efficient alternative to conventional single-step and search-based approaches. These results highlight the potential of template generative modeling as a powerful paradigm in computer-aided synthesis planning.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Interpretability for RF Sensing: A Complex-Valued White-Box Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The empirical success of deep learning has spurred its application to the radio-frequency (RF) domain, leading to significant advances in Deep Wireless Sensing (DWS). However, most existing DWS models function as black boxes with limited interpretability, which hampers their generalizability and raises concerns in security-sensitive physical applications. In this work, inspired by the remarkable advances of white-box transformers, we present RF-CRATE, the first mathematically interpretable deep network architecture for RF sensing, grounded in the principles of complex sparse rate reduction. To accommodate the unique RF signals, we conduct non-trivial theoretical derivations that extend the original real-valued white-box transformer to the complex domain. By leveraging the CR-Calculus framework, we successfully construct a fully complex-valued white-box transformer with theoretically derived self-attention and residual multi-layer perceptron modules. Furthermore, to improve the model's ability to extract discriminative features from limited wireless data, we introduce Subspace Regularization, a novel regularization strategy that enhances feature diversity, resulting in an average performance improvement of 19.98% across multiple sensing tasks. We extensively evaluate RF-CRATE against seven baselines with multiple public and self-collected datasets involving different RF signals. The results show that RF-CRATE achieves performance on par with thoroughly engineered black-box models, while offering full mathematical interpretability. More importantly, by extending CRATE to the complex domain, RF-CRATE yields substantial improvements, achieving an average classification gain of 5.08% and reducing regression error by 10.34% across diverse sensing tasks compared to CRATE. RF-CRATE is fully open-sourced at: https://github.com/rfcrate/RF_CRATE.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Neural Network Surrogates for Bayesian Optimization of Carbon Capture and Storage Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) stands as a pivotal technology for fostering a sustainable future. The process, which involves injecting supercritical CO$_2$ into underground formations, a method already widely used for Enhanced Oil Recovery, serves a dual purpose: it not only curbs CO$_2$ emissions and addresses climate change but also extends the operational lifespan and sustainability of oil fields and platforms, easing the shift toward greener practices. This paper delivers a thorough comparative evaluation of strategies for optimizing decision variables in CCS project development, employing a derivative-free technique known as Bayesian Optimization. In addition to Gaussian Processes, which usually serve as the gold standard in BO, various novel stochastic models were examined and compared within a BO framework. This research investigates the effectiveness of utilizing more exotic stochastic models than GPs for BO in environments where GPs have been shown to underperform, such as in cases with a large number of decision variables or multiple objective functions that are not similarly scaled. By incorporating Net Present Value (NPV) as a key objective function, the proposed framework demonstrates its potential to improve economic viability while ensuring the sustainable deployment of CCS technologies. Ultimately, this study represents the first application in the reservoir engineering industry of the growing body of BO research, specifically in the search for more appropriate stochastic models, highlighting its potential as a preferred method for enhancing sustainability in the energy sector.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Fourier Neural Operators via Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have emerged as leading surrogates for high-dimensional partial-differential equations, yet their stability, generalization and frequency behavior lack a principled explanation. We present the first systematic effective-field-theory analysis of FNOs in an infinite-dimensional function space, deriving closed recursion relations for the layer kernel and four-point vertex and then examining three practically important settings-analytic activations, scale-invariant cases and architectures with residual connections. The theory shows that nonlinear activations inevitably couple frequency inputs to high-frequency modes that are otherwise discarded by spectral truncation, and experiments confirm this frequency transfer. For wide networks we obtain explicit criticality conditions on the weight-initialization ensemble that keep small input perturbations to have uniform scale across depth, and empirical tests validate these predictions. Taken together, our results quantify how nonlinearity enables neural operators to capture non-trivial features, supply criteria for hyper-parameter selection via criticality analysis, and explain why scale-invariant activations and residual connections enhance feature learning in FNOs.</description>

      <title>Discovering Interpretable Ordinary Differential Equations from Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The data-driven discovery of interpretable models approximating the underlying dynamics of a physical system has gained attraction in the past decade. Current approaches employ pre-specified functional forms or basis functions and often result in models that lack physical meaning and interpretability, let alone represent the true physics of the system. We propose an unsupervised parameter estimation methodology that first finds an approximate general solution, followed by a spline transformation to linearly estimate the coefficients of the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE). The approximate general solution is postulated using the same functional form as the analytical solution of a general homogeneous, linear, constant-coefficient ODE. An added advantage is its ability to produce a high-fidelity, smooth functional form even in the presence of noisy data. The spline approximation obtains gradient information from the functional form which are linearly independent and creates the basis of the gradient matrix. This gradient matrix is used in a linear system to find the coefficients of the ODEs. From the case studies, we observed that our modeling approach discovers ODEs with high accuracy and also promotes sparsity in the solution without using any regularization techniques. The methodology is also robust to noisy data and thus allows the integration of data-driven techniques into real experimental setting for data-driven learning of physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Cardiovascular Disease Prediction using Machine Learning: A Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a main cause of mortality globally, accounting for 31% of all deaths. This study involves a cardiovascular disease (CVD) dataset comprising 68,119 records to explore the influence of numerical (age, height, weight, blood pressure, BMI) and categorical gender, cholesterol, glucose, smoking, alcohol, activity) factors on CVD occurrence. We have performed statistical analyses, including t-tests, Chi-square tests, and ANOVA, to identify strong associations between CVD and elderly people, hypertension, higher weight, and abnormal cholesterol levels, while physical activity (a protective factor). A logistic regression model highlights age, blood pressure, and cholesterol as primary risk factors, with unexpected negative associations for smoking and alcohol, suggesting potential data issues. Model performance comparisons reveal CatBoost as the top performer with an accuracy of 0.734 and an ECE of 0.0064 and excels in probabilistic prediction (Brier score = 0.1824). Data challenges, including outliers and skewed distributions, indicate a need for improved preprocessing to enhance predictive reliability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural biology has long been dominated by the one sequence, one structure, one function paradigm, yet many critical biological processes - from enzyme catalysis to membrane transport - depend on proteins that adopt multiple conformational states. Existing multi-state design approaches rely on post-hoc aggregation of single-state predictions, achieving poor experimental success rates compared to single-state design. We introduce DynamicMPNN, an inverse folding model explicitly trained to generate sequences compatible with multiple conformations through joint learning across conformational ensembles. Trained on 46,033 conformational pairs covering 75% of CATH superfamilies and evaluated using AlphaFold initial guess, DynamicMPNN outperforms ProteinMPNN by up to 13% on structure-normalized RMSD across our challenging multi-state protein benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud computing offers on-demand resource access, regulated by Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) between consumers and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). SLA violations can impact efficiency and CSP profitability. In this work, we propose an SLA-aware automated algorithm-selection framework for combinatorial optimization problems in resource-constrained cloud environments. The framework uses an ensemble of machine learning models to predict performance and rank algorithm-hardware pairs based on SLA constraints. We also apply our framework to the 0-1 knapsack problem. We curate a dataset comprising instance specific features along with memory usage, runtime, and optimality gap for 6 algorithms. As an empirical benchmark, we evaluate the framework on both classification and regression tasks. Our ablation study explores the impact of hyperparameters, learning approaches, and large language models effectiveness in regression, and SHAP-based interpretability.</description>

      <title>Improving Generative Ad Text on Facebook using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large language models (LLMs), is poised to drive transformative economic change. LLMs are pre-trained on vast text data to learn general language patterns, but a subsequent post-training phase is critical to align them for specific real-world tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) is the leading post-training technique, yet its economic impact remains largely underexplored and unquantified. We examine this question through the lens of the first deployment of an RL-trained LLM for generative advertising on Facebook. Integrated into Meta's Text Generation feature, our model, "AdLlama," powers an AI tool that helps advertisers create new variations of human-written ad text. To train this model, we introduce reinforcement learning with performance feedback (RLPF), a post-training method that uses historical ad performance data as a reward signal. In a large-scale 10-week A/B test on Facebook spanning nearly 35,000 advertisers and 640,000 ad variations, we find that AdLlama improves click-through rates by 6.7% (p=0.0296) compared to a supervised imitation model trained on curated ads. This represents a substantial improvement in advertiser return on investment on Facebook. We also find that advertisers who used AdLlama generated more ad variations, indicating higher satisfaction with the model's outputs. To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date on the use of generative AI in an ecologically valid setting, offering an important data point quantifying the tangible impact of RL post-training. Furthermore, the results show that RLPF is a promising and generalizable approach for metric-driven post-training that bridges the gap between highly capable language models and tangible outcomes.</description>

      <title>Teach Me to Trick: Exploring Adversarial Transferability via Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether knowledge distillation (KD) from multiple heterogeneous teacher models can enhance the generation of transferable adversarial examples. A lightweight student model is trained using two KD strategies: curriculum-based switching and joint optimization, with ResNet50 and DenseNet-161 as teachers. The trained student is then used to generate adversarial examples using FG, FGS, and PGD attacks, which are evaluated against a black-box target model (GoogLeNet). Our results show that student models distilled from multiple teachers achieve attack success rates comparable to ensemble-based baselines, while reducing adversarial example generation time by up to a factor of six. An ablation study further reveals that lower temperature settings and the inclusion of hard-label supervision significantly enhance transferability. These findings suggest that KD can serve not only as a model compression technique but also as a powerful tool for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of black-box adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Classification of Honey Botanical and Geographical Sources using Mineral Profiles and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for identifying honey floral and geographical sources using mineral element profiles. The proposed method comprises two steps: preprocessing and classification. The preprocessing phase involves missing-value treatment and data normalization. In the classification phase, we employ various supervised classification models for discriminating between six botanical sources and 13 geographical origins of honey. We test the classifiers' performance on a publicly available honey mineral element dataset. The dataset contains mineral element profiles of honeys from various floral and geographical origins. Results show that mineral element content in honey provides discriminative information useful for classifying honey botanical and geographical sources. Results also show that the Random Forests (RF) classifier obtains the best performance on this dataset, achieving a cross-validation accuracy of 99.30% for classifying honey botanical origins and 98.01% for classifying honey geographical origins.</description>

      <title>Structure-Informed Deep Reinforcement Learning for Inventory Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to classical inventory management problems, with a focus on practical implementation considerations. We apply a DRL algorithm based on DirectBackprop to several fundamental inventory management scenarios including multi-period systems with lost sales (with and without lead times), perishable inventory management, dual sourcing, and joint inventory procurement and removal. The DRL approach learns policies across products using only historical information that would be available in practice, avoiding unrealistic assumptions about demand distributions or access to distribution parameters. We demonstrate that our generic DRL implementation performs competitively against or outperforms established benchmarks and heuristics across these diverse settings, while requiring minimal parameter tuning. Through examination of the learned policies, we show that the DRL approach naturally captures many known structural properties of optimal policies derived from traditional operations research methods. To further improve policy performance and interpretability, we propose a Structure-Informed Policy Network technique that explicitly incorporates analytically-derived characteristics of optimal policies into the learning process. This approach can help interpretability and add robustness to the policy in out-of-sample performance, as we demonstrate in an example with realistic demand data. Finally, we provide an illustrative application of DRL in a non-stationary setting. Our work bridges the gap between data-driven learning and analytical insights in inventory management while maintaining practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Weight-Parameterization in Continuous Time Deep Neural Networks for Surrogate Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-time deep learning models, such as neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs), offer a promising framework for surrogate modeling of complex physical systems. A central challenge in training these models lies in learning expressive yet stable time-varying weights, particularly under computational constraints. This work investigates weight parameterization strategies that constrain the temporal evolution of weights to a low-dimensional subspace spanned by polynomial basis functions. We evaluate both monomial and Legendre polynomial bases within neural ODE and residual network (ResNet) architectures under discretize-then-optimize and optimize-then-discretize training paradigms. Experimental results across three high-dimensional benchmark problems show that Legendre parameterizations yield more stable training dynamics, reduce computational cost, and achieve accuracy comparable to or better than both monomial parameterizations and unconstrained weight models. These findings elucidate the role of basis choice in time-dependent weight parameterization and demonstrate that using orthogonal polynomial bases offers a favorable tradeoff between model expressivity and training efficiency.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models for Demand Forecasting via Dual-Strategy Ensembling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is critical for supply chain optimization, yet remains difficult in practice due to hierarchical complexity, domain shifts, and evolving external factors. While recent foundation models offer strong potential for time series forecasting, they often suffer from architectural rigidity and limited robustness under distributional change. In this paper, we propose a unified ensemble framework that enhances the performance of foundation models for sales forecasting in real-world supply chains. Our method combines two complementary strategies: (1) Hierarchical Ensemble (HE), which partitions training and inference by semantic levels (e.g., store, category, department) to capture localized patterns; and (2) Architectural Ensemble (AE), which integrates predictions from diverse model backbones to mitigate bias and improve stability. We conduct extensive experiments on the M5 benchmark and three external sales datasets, covering both in-domain and zero-shot forecasting. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines, improves accuracy across hierarchical levels, and provides a simple yet effective mechanism for boosting generalization in complex forecasting environments.</description>

      <title>High hopes for "Deep Medicine"? AI, economics, and the future of care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the much-celebrated book Deep Medicine, Eric Topol argues that the development of artificial intelligence for health care will lead to a dramatic shift in the culture and practice of medicine. In the next several decades, he suggests, AI will become sophisticated enough that many of the everyday tasks of physicians could be delegated to it. Topol is perhaps the most articulate advocate of the benefits of AI in medicine, but he is hardly alone in spruiking its potential to allow physicians to dedicate more of their time and attention to providing empathetic care for their patients in the future. Unfortunately, several factors suggest a radically different picture for the future of health care. Far from facilitating a return to a time of closer doctor-patient relationships, the use of medical AI seems likely to further erode therapeutic relationships and threaten professional and patient satisfaction.</description>

      <title>Dialogic Social Learning for Artificial Agents: Enhancing LLM Ontology Acquisition through Mixed-Initiative Educational Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing extensive offline datasets. However, they often face challenges in acquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training paradigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement learning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These approaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals, limiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing inspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the potential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.
  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI learner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI teacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a core mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend solely on internal inference or pattern recognition.
  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the AI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results indicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving mixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with learner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to acquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional instructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats typically present in training datasets.
  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological insights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training knowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a complementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering</description>

      <title>Reviving Your MNEME: Predicting The Side Effects of LLM Unlearning and Fine-Tuning via Sparse Model Diffing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned or unlearned to adapt to new tasks or eliminate undesirable behaviors. While existing evaluation methods assess performance after such interventions, there remains no general approach for detecting unintended side effects, such as unlearning biology content degrading performance on chemistry tasks, particularly when these effects are unpredictable or emergent. To address this issue, we introduce MNEME, Model diffiNg for Evaluating Mechanistic Effects, a lightweight framework for identifying these side effects using sparse model diffing. MNEME compares base and fine-tuned models on task-agnostic data (for example, The Pile, LMSYS-Chat-1M) without access to fine-tuning data to isolate behavioral shifts. Applied to five LLMs across three scenarios: WMDP knowledge unlearning, emergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning, MNEME achieves up to 95 percent accuracy in predicting side effects, aligning with known benchmarks and requiring no custom heuristics. Furthermore, we show that retraining on high-activation samples can partially reverse these effects. Our results demonstrate that sparse probing and diffing offer a scalable and automated lens into fine-tuning-induced model changes, providing practical tools for understanding and managing LLM behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid rise of InsurTech, traditional insurance companies are increasingly exploring alternative data sources and advanced technologies to sustain their competitive edge. This paper provides both a conceptual overview and practical case studies of natural language processing (NLP) and its emerging applications within insurance operations with a focus on transforming raw, unstructured text into structured data suitable for actuarial analysis and decision-making. Leveraging real-world alternative data provided by an InsurTech industry partner that enriches traditional insurance data sources, we apply various NLP techniques to demonstrate practical use cases in the commercial insurance context. These enriched, text-derived insights not only add to and refine traditional rating factors for commercial insurance pricing but also offer novel perspectives for assessing underlying risk by introducing novel industry classifications. Through these demonstrations, we show that NLP is not merely a supplementary tool but a foundational element for modern, data-driven insurance analytics.</description>

      <title>FedFlex: Federated Learning for Diverse Netflix Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized approach that enables collaborative model training across multiple devices while preserving data privacy. It has shown significant potential in various domains, including healthcare and personalized recommendation systems. However, most existing work on federated recommendation systems has focused primarily on improving accuracy, with limited attention to fairness and diversity. In this paper, we introduce FedFlex, a federated recommender system for Netflix-style TV series recommendations. FedFlex integrates two state-of-the-art matrix factorization algorithms for personalized fine-tuning. FedFlex also applies Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) to re-rank items and enhance diversity. We conduct extensive experiments comparing recommendations generated by SVD and BPR algorithms. In a live two-week user study, participants received two recommendation lists: List A, based on SVD or BPR, and List B, a re-ranked version emphasizing diversity. Participants were asked to click on the movies they were interested in watching. Our findings demonstrate that FedFlex effectively introduces diverse content, such as new genres, into recommendations without necessarily compromising user satisfaction.</description>

      <title>Failure Risk Prediction in a MOOC: A Multivariate Time Series Analysis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MOOCs offer free and open access to a wide audience, but completion rates remain low, often due to a lack of personalized content. To address this issue, it is essential to predict learner performance in order to provide tailored feedback. Behavioral traces-such as clicks and events-can be analyzed as time series to anticipate learners' outcomes. This work compares multivariate time series classification methods to identify at-risk learners at different stages of the course (after 5, 10 weeks, etc.). The experimental evaluation, conducted on the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD), focuses on three courses: two in STEM and one in SHS. Preliminary results show that the evaluated approaches are promising for predicting learner failure in MOOCs. The analysis also suggests that prediction accuracy is influenced by the amount of recorded interactions, highlighting the importance of rich and diverse behavioral data.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Generative AI to Enhance Synthea Module Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to assist in the development of new disease modules for Synthea, an open-source synthetic health data generator. Incorporating LLMs into the module development process has the potential to reduce development time, reduce required expertise, expand model diversity, and improve the overall quality of synthetic patient data. We demonstrate four ways that LLMs can support Synthea module creation: generating a disease profile, generating a disease module from a disease profile, evaluating an existing Synthea module, and refining an existing module. We introduce the concept of progressive refinement, which involves iteratively evaluating the LLM-generated module by checking its syntactic correctness and clinical accuracy, and then using that information to modify the module. While the use of LLMs in this context shows promise, we also acknowledge the challenges and limitations, such as the need for human oversight, the importance of rigorous testing and validation, and the potential for inaccuracies in LLM-generated content. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research and development to fully realize the potential of LLM-aided synthetic data creation.</description>

      <title>VizGenie: Toward Self-Refining, Domain-Aware Workflows for Next-Generation Scientific Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present VizGenie, a self-improving, agentic framework that advances scientific visualization through large language model (LLM) by orchestrating of a collection of domain-specific and dynamically generated modules. Users initially access core functionalities--such as threshold-based filtering, slice extraction, and statistical analysis--through pre-existing tools. For tasks beyond this baseline, VizGenie autonomously employs LLMs to generate new visualization scripts (e.g., VTK Python code), expanding its capabilities on-demand. Each generated script undergoes automated backend validation and is seamlessly integrated upon successful testing, continuously enhancing the system's adaptability and robustness. A distinctive feature of VizGenie is its intuitive natural language interface, allowing users to issue high-level feature-based queries (e.g., ``visualize the skull"). The system leverages image-based analysis and visual question answering (VQA) via fine-tuned vision models to interpret these queries precisely, bridging domain expertise and technical implementation. Additionally, users can interactively query generated visualizations through VQA, facilitating deeper exploration. Reliability and reproducibility are further strengthened by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), providing context-driven responses while maintaining comprehensive provenance records. Evaluations on complex volumetric datasets demonstrate significant reductions in cognitive overhead for iterative visualization tasks. By integrating curated domain-specific tools with LLM-driven flexibility, VizGenie not only accelerates insight generation but also establishes a sustainable, continuously evolving visualization practice. The resulting platform dynamically learns from user interactions, consistently enhancing support for feature-centric exploration and reproducible research in scientific visualization.</description>

      <title>RATE: An LLM-Powered Retrieval Augmented Generation Technology-Extraction Pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an era of radical technology transformations, technology maps play a crucial role in enhancing decision making. These maps heavily rely on automated methods of technology extraction. This paper introduces Retrieval Augmented Technology Extraction (RATE), a Large Language Model (LLM) based pipeline for automated technology extraction from scientific literature. RATE combines Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with multi-definition LLM-based validation. This hybrid method results in high recall in candidate generation alongside with high precision in candidate filtering. While the pipeline is designed to be general and widely applicable, we demonstrate its use on 678 research articles focused on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and Extended Reality (XR) as a case study. Consequently, The validated technology terms by RATE were mapped into a co-occurrence network, revealing thematic clusters and structural features of the research landscape. For the purpose of evaluation, a gold standard dataset of technologies in 70 selected random articles had been curated by the experts. In addition, a technology extraction model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations of Transformers (BERT) was used as a comparative method. RATE achieved F1-score of 91.27%, Significantly outperforming BERT with F1-score of 53.73%. Our findings highlight the promise of definition-driven LLM methods for technology extraction and mapping.

      <title>Can You Trust an LLM with Your Life-Changing Decision? An Investigation into AI High-Stakes Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly consulted for high-stakes life advice, yet they lack standard safeguards against providing confident but misguided responses. This creates risks of sycophancy and over-confidence. This paper investigates these failure modes through three experiments: (1) a multiple-choice evaluation to measure model stability against user pressure; (2) a free-response analysis using a novel safety typology and an LLM Judge; and (3) a mechanistic interpretability experiment to steer model behavior by manipulating a "high-stakes" activation vector. Our results show that while some models exhibit sycophancy, others like o4-mini remain robust. Top-performing models achieve high safety scores by frequently asking clarifying questions, a key feature of a safe, inquisitive approach, rather than issuing prescriptive advice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a model's cautiousness can be directly controlled via activation steering, suggesting a new path for safety alignment. These findings underscore the need for nuanced, multi-faceted benchmarks to ensure LLMs can be trusted with life-changing decisions.</description>

      <title>TRIDENT: Benchmarking LLM Safety in Finance, Medicine, and Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk domains such as law, finance, and medicine, systematically evaluating their domain-specific safety and compliance becomes critical. While prior work has largely focused on improving LLM performance in these domains, it has often neglected the evaluation of domain-specific safety risks. To bridge this gap, we first define domain-specific safety principles for LLMs based on the AMA Principles of Medical Ethics, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and the CFA Institute Code of Ethics. Building on this foundation, we introduce Trident-Bench, a benchmark specifically targeting LLM safety in the legal, financial, and medical domains. We evaluated 19 general-purpose and domain-specialized models on Trident-Bench and show that it effectively reveals key safety gaps -- strong generalist models (e.g., GPT, Gemini) can meet basic expectations, whereas domain-specialized models often struggle with subtle ethical nuances. This highlights an urgent need for finer-grained domain-specific safety improvements. By introducing Trident-Bench, our work provides one of the first systematic resources for studying LLM safety in law and finance, and lays the groundwork for future research aimed at reducing the safety risks of deploying LLMs in professionally regulated fields. Code and benchmark will be released at: https://github.com/zackhuiiiii/TRIDENT</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Inworld TTS-1, a set of two Transformer-based autoregressive text-to-speech (TTS) models. Our largest model, TTS-1-Max, has 8.8B parameters and is designed for utmost quality and expressiveness in demanding applications. TTS-1 is our most efficient model, with 1.6B parameters, built for real-time speech synthesis and on-device use cases. By scaling train-time compute and applying a sequential process of pre-training, fine-tuning, and RL-alignment of the speech-language model (SpeechLM) component, both models achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional quality relying purely on in-context learning of the speaker's voice. Inworld TTS-1 and TTS-1-Max can generate high-resolution 48 kHz speech with low latency, and support 11 languages with fine-grained emotional control and non-verbal vocalizations through audio markups. We additionally open-source our training and modeling code under an MIT license.</description>

Abstract: The emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs) has revolutionized computer vision, yet their effectiveness compared to traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in medical imaging remains under-explored. This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of CNN and ViT architectures across three critical medical imaging tasks: chest X-ray pneumonia detection, brain tumor classification, and skin cancer melanoma detection. We evaluated four state-of-the-art models - ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B0, ViT-Base, and DeiT-Small - across datasets totaling 8,469 medical images. Our results demonstrate task-specific model advantages: ResNet-50 achieved 98.37% accuracy on chest X-ray classification, DeiT-Small excelled at brain tumor detection with 92.16% accuracy, and EfficientNet-B0 led skin cancer classification at 81.84% accuracy. These findings provide crucial insights for practitioners selecting architectures for medical AI applications, highlighting the importance of task-specific architecture selection in clinical decision support systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Cluster Collaborativeness Boosts LLMs Medical Decision Support Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collaborativeness of large language models (LLMs) has proven effective in natural language processing systems, holding considerable promise for healthcare development. However, it lacks explicit component selection rules, necessitating human intervention or clinical-specific validation. Moreover, existing architectures heavily rely on a predefined LLM cluster, where partial LLMs underperform in medical decision support scenarios, invalidating the collaborativeness of LLMs. To this end, we propose an adaptive cluster collaborativeness methodology involving self-diversity and cross-consistency maximization mechanisms to boost LLMs medical decision support capacity. For the self-diversity, we calculate the fuzzy matching value of pairwise outputs within an LLM as its self-diversity value, subsequently prioritizing LLMs with high self-diversity values as cluster components in a training-free manner. For the cross-consistency, we first measure cross-consistency values between the LLM with the highest self-diversity value and others, and then gradually mask out the LLM having the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the potential inconsistent output during the collaborative propagation. Extensive experiments on two specialized medical datasets, NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across physician-oriented specialties. For example, on NEJMQA, our method achieves the accuracy rate up to the publicly official passing score across all disciplines, especially achieving ACC of 65.47\% compared to the 56.12\% achieved by GPT-4 on the Obstetrics and Gynecology discipline.</description>

      <title>Seeing Beyond Frames: Zero-Shot Pedestrian Intention Prediction with Raw Temporal Video and Multimodal Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pedestrian intention prediction is essential for autonomous driving in complex urban environments. Conventional approaches depend on supervised learning over frame sequences and require extensive retraining to adapt to new scenarios. Here, we introduce BF-PIP (Beyond Frames Pedestrian Intention Prediction), a zero-shot approach built upon Gemini 2.5 Pro. It infers crossing intentions directly from short, continuous video clips enriched with structured JAAD metadata. In contrast to GPT-4V based methods that operate on discrete frames, BF-PIP processes uninterrupted temporal clips. It also incorporates bounding-box annotations and ego-vehicle speed via specialized multimodal prompts. Without any additional training, BF-PIP achieves 73% prediction accuracy, outperforming a GPT-4V baseline by 18 %. These findings illustrate that combining temporal video inputs with contextual cues enhances spatiotemporal perception and improves intent inference under ambiguous conditions. This approach paves the way for agile, retraining-free perception module in intelligent transportation system.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Powered Automated Modeling and Optimization of Active Distribution Network Dispatch Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources into active distribution networks (ADNs) has made effective ADN dispatch imperative. However, the numerous newly-integrated ADN operators, such as distribution system aggregators, virtual power plant managers, and end prosumers, often lack specialized expertise in power system operation, modeling, optimization, and programming. This knowledge gap renders reliance on human experts both costly and time-intensive. To address this challenge and enable intelligent, flexible ADN dispatch, this paper proposes a large language model (LLM) powered automated modeling and optimization approach. First, the ADN dispatch problems are decomposed into sequential stages, and a multi-LLM coordination architecture is designed. This framework comprises an Information Extractor, a Problem Formulator, and a Code Programmer, tasked with information retrieval, optimization problem formulation, and code implementation, respectively. Afterwards, tailored refinement techniques are developed for each LLM agent, greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content. The proposed approach features a user-centric interface that enables ADN operators to derive dispatch strategies via simple natural language queries, eliminating technical barriers and increasing efficiency. Comprehensive comparisons and end-to-end demonstrations on various test cases validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and methods.</description>

      <title>Generating Adversarial Point Clouds Using Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attack methods for 3D point cloud classification reveal the vulnerabilities of point cloud recognition models. This vulnerability could lead to safety risks in critical applications that use deep learning models, such as autonomous vehicles. To uncover the deficiencies of these models, researchers can evaluate their security through adversarial attacks. However, most existing adversarial attack methods are based on white-box attacks. While these methods achieve high attack success rates and imperceptibility, their applicability in real-world scenarios is limited. Black-box attacks, which are more meaningful in real-world scenarios, often yield poor results. This paper proposes a novel black-box adversarial example generation method that utilizes a diffusion model to improve the attack success rate and imperceptibility in the black-box setting, without relying on the internal information of the point cloud classification model to generate adversarial samples. We use a 3D diffusion model to use the compressed features of the point cloud as prior knowledge to guide the reverse diffusion process to add adversarial points to clean examples. Subsequently, its reverse process is employed to transform the distribution of other categories into adversarial points, which are then added to the point cloud.</description>

      <title>Diverse LLMs or Diverse Question Interpretations? That is the Ensembling Question</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effectively leveraging diversity has been shown to improve performance for various machine learning models, including large language models (LLMs). However, determining the most effective way of using diversity remains a challenge. In this work, we compare two diversity approaches for answering binary questions using LLMs: model diversity, which relies on multiple models answering the same question, and question interpretation diversity, which relies on using the same model to answer the same question framed in different ways. For both cases, we apply majority voting as the ensemble consensus heuristic to determine the final answer. Our experiments on boolq, strategyqa, and pubmedqa show that question interpretation diversity consistently leads to better ensemble accuracy compared to model diversity. Furthermore, our analysis of GPT and LLaMa shows that model diversity typically produces results between the best and the worst ensemble members without clear improvement.</description>

      <title>FedBAP: Backdoor Defense via Benign Adversarial Perturbation in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy, but it is highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Most existing defense methods in FL have limited effectiveness due to their neglect of the model's over-reliance on backdoor triggers, particularly as the proportion of malicious clients increases. In this paper, we propose FedBAP, a novel defense framework for mitigating backdoor attacks in FL by reducing the model's reliance on backdoor triggers. Specifically, first, we propose a perturbed trigger generation mechanism that creates perturbation triggers precisely matching backdoor triggers in location and size, ensuring strong influence on model outputs. Second, we utilize these perturbation triggers to generate benign adversarial perturbations that disrupt the model's dependence on backdoor triggers while forcing it to learn more robust decision boundaries. Finally, we design an adaptive scaling mechanism to dynamically adjust perturbation intensity, effectively balancing defense strength and model performance. The experimental results demonstrate that FedBAP reduces the attack success rates by 0.22%-5.34%, 0.48%-6.34%, and 97.22%-97.6% under three types of backdoor attacks, respectively. In particular, FedBAP demonstrates outstanding performance against novel backdoor attacks.</description>

      <title>Contrast-CAT: Contrasting Activations for Enhanced Interpretability in Transformer-based Text Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have profoundly influenced AI research, but explaining their decisions remains challenging -- even for relatively simpler tasks such as classification -- which hinders trust and safe deployment in real-world applications. Although activation-based attribution methods effectively explain transformer-based text classification models, our findings reveal that these methods can be undermined by class-irrelevant features within activations, leading to less reliable interpretations. To address this limitation, we propose Contrast-CAT, a novel activation contrast-based attribution method that refines token-level attributions by filtering out class-irrelevant features. By contrasting the activations of an input sequence with reference activations, Contrast-CAT generates clearer and more faithful attribution maps. Experimental results across various datasets and models confirm that Contrast-CAT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, under the MoRF setting, it achieves average improvements of x1.30 in AOPC and x2.25 in LOdds over the most competing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing interpretability for transformer-based text classification.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Anomaly-Based DDoS Detection in AI-RAN with XAI and LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next generation Radio Access Networks (RANs) introduce programmability, intelligence, and near real-time control through intelligent controllers, enabling enhanced security within the RAN and across broader 5G/6G infrastructures. This paper presents a comprehensive survey highlighting opportunities, challenges, and research gaps for Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted explainable (XAI) intrusion detection (IDS) for secure future RAN environments. Motivated by this, we propose an LLM interpretable anomaly-based detection system for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks using multivariate time series key performance measures (KPMs), extracted from E2 nodes, within the Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC). An LSTM-based model is trained to identify malicious User Equipment (UE) behavior based on these KPMs. To enhance transparency, we apply post-hoc local explainability methods such as LIME and SHAP to interpret individual predictions. Furthermore, LLMs are employed to convert technical explanations into natural-language insights accessible to non-expert users. Experimental results on real 5G network KPMs demonstrate that our framework achieves high detection accuracy (F1-score &gt; 0.96) while delivering actionable and interpretable outputs.</description>

      <title>PanoGAN A Deep Generative Model for Panoramic Dental Radiographs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a generative adversarial network (GAN) for synthesizing dental panoramic radiographs. Although exploratory in nature, the study aims to address the scarcity of data in dental research and education. We trained a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) using a Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty (WGANGP) on a dataset of 2322 radiographs of varying quality. The focus was on the dentoalveolar regions, other anatomical structures were cropped out. Extensive preprocessing and data cleaning were performed to standardize the inputs while preserving anatomical variability. We explored four candidate models by varying critic iterations, feature depth, and the use of denoising prior to training. A clinical expert evaluated the generated radiographs based on anatomical visibility and realism, using a 5-point scale (1 very poor 5 excellent). Most images showed moderate anatomical depiction, although some were degraded by artifacts. A trade-off was observed the model trained on non-denoised data yielded finer details especially in structures like the mandibular canal and trabecular bone, while a model trained on denoised data offered superior overall image clarity and sharpness. These findings provide a foundation for future work on GAN-based methods in dental imaging.</description>

Abstract: Selecting appropriate inductive biases is an essential step in the design of machine learning models, especially when working with audio, where even short clips may contain millions of samples. To this end, we propose the combolutional layer: a learned-delay IIR comb filter and fused envelope detector, which extracts harmonic features in the time domain. We demonstrate the efficacy of the combolutional layer on three information retrieval tasks, evaluate its computational cost relative to other audio frontends, and provide efficient implementations for training. We find that the combolutional layer is an effective replacement for convolutional layers in audio tasks where precise harmonic analysis is important, e.g., piano transcription, speaker classification, and key detection. Additionally, the combolutional layer has several other key benefits over existing frontends, namely: low parameter count, efficient CPU inference, strictly real-valued computations, and improved interpretability.</description>

      <title>An empirical comparison of some outlier detection methods with longitudinal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note investigates the problem of detecting outliers in longitudinal data. It compares well-known methods used in official statistics with proposals from the fields of data mining and machine learning that are based on the distance between observations or binary partitioning trees. This is achieved by applying the methods to panel survey data related to different types of statistical units. Traditional methods are quite simple, enabling the direct identification of potential outliers, but they require specific assumptions. In contrast, recent methods provide only a score whose magnitude is directly related to the likelihood of an outlier being present. All the methods require the user to set a number of tuning parameters. However, the most recent methods are more flexible and sometimes more effective than traditional methods. In addition, these methods can be applied to multidimensional data.</description>

      <title>Agentic Web: Weaving the Next Web with AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) marks a pivotal shift toward the Agentic Web, a new phase of the internet defined by autonomous, goal-driven interactions. In this paradigm, agents interact directly with one another to plan, coordinate, and execute complex tasks on behalf of users. This transition from human-driven to machine-to-machine interaction allows intent to be delegated, relieving users from routine digital operations and enabling a more interactive, automated web experience. In this paper, we present a structured framework for understanding and building the Agentic Web. We trace its evolution from the PC and Mobile Web eras and identify the core technological foundations that support this shift. Central to our framework is a conceptual model consisting of three key dimensions: intelligence, interaction, and economics. These dimensions collectively enable the capabilities of AI agents, such as retrieval, recommendation, planning, and collaboration. We analyze the architectural and infrastructural challenges involved in creating scalable agentic systems, including communication protocols, orchestration strategies, and emerging paradigms such as the Agent Attention Economy. We conclude by discussing the potential applications, societal risks, and governance issues posed by agentic systems, and outline research directions for developing open, secure, and intelligent ecosystems shaped by both human intent and autonomous agent behavior. A continuously updated collection of relevant studies for agentic web is available at: https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/agentic-web.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking a Tunable Quantum Neural Network on Trapped-Ion and Superconducting Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement a quantum generalization of a neural network on trapped-ion and IBM superconducting quantum computers to classify MNIST images, a common benchmark in computer vision. The network feedforward involves qubit rotations whose angles depend on the results of measurements in the previous layer. The network is trained via simulation, but inference is performed experimentally on quantum hardware. The classical-to-quantum correspondence is controlled by an interpolation parameter, $a$, which is zero in the classical limit. Increasing $a$ introduces quantum uncertainty into the measurements, which is shown to improve network performance at moderate values of the interpolation parameter. We then focus on particular images that fail to be classified by a classical neural network but are detected correctly in the quantum network. For such borderline cases, we observe strong deviations from the simulated behavior. We attribute this to physical noise, which causes the output to fluctuate between nearby minima of the classification energy landscape. Such strong sensitivity to physical noise is absent for clear images. We further benchmark physical noise by inserting additional single-qubit and two-qubit gate pairs into the neural network circuits. Our work provides a springboard toward more complex quantum neural networks on current devices: while the approach is rooted in standard classical machine learning, scaling up such networks may prove classically non-simulable and could offer a route to near-term quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Fluidically Innervated Lattices Make Versatile and Durable Tactile Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tactile sensing plays a fundamental role in enabling robots to navigate dynamic and unstructured environments, particularly in applications such as delicate object manipulation, surface exploration, and human-robot interaction. In this paper, we introduce a passive soft robotic fingertip with integrated tactile sensing, fabricated using a 3D-printed elastomer lattice with embedded air channels. This sensorization approach, termed fluidic innervation, transforms the lattice into a tactile sensor by detecting pressure changes within sealed air channels, providing a simple yet robust solution to tactile sensing in robotics. Unlike conventional methods that rely on complex materials or designs, fluidic innervation offers a simple, scalable, single-material fabrication process. We characterize the sensors' response, develop a geometric model to estimate tip displacement, and train a neural network to accurately predict contact location and contact force. Additionally, we integrate the fingertip with an admittance controller to emulate spring-like behavior, demonstrate its capability for environment exploration through tactile feedback, and validate its durability under high impact and cyclic loading conditions. This tactile sensing technique offers advantages in terms of simplicity, adaptability, and durability and opens up new opportunities for versatile robotic manipulation.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Denoiser-Aided Gyrocompassing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An accurate initial heading angle is essential for efficient and safe navigation across diverse domains. Unlike magnetometers, gyroscopes can provide accurate heading reference independent of the magnetic disturbances in a process known as gyrocompassing. Yet, accurate and timely gyrocompassing, using low-cost gyroscopes, remains a significant challenge in scenarios where external navigation aids are unavailable. Such challenges are commonly addressed in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, where size, weight, and power limitations restrict sensor quality, and noisy measurements severely degrade gyrocompassing performance. To cope with this challenge, we propose a novel diffusion denoiser-aided gyrocompass approach. It integrates a diffusion-based denoising framework with an enhanced learning-based heading estimation model. The diffusion denoiser processes raw inertial sensor signals before input to the deep learning model, resulting in accurate gyrocompassing. Experiments using both simulated and real sensor data demonstrate that our proposed approach improves gyrocompassing accuracy by 26% compared to model-based gyrocompassing and by 15% compared to other learning-driven approaches. This advancement holds particular significance for ensuring accurate and robust navigation in autonomous platforms that incorporate low-cost gyroscopes within their navigation systems.</description>

      <title>Multiscale geometrical and topological learning in the analysis of soft matter collective dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior and evolution of a dynamical many-body system by analyzing patterns in their experimentally captured images is a promising method relevant for a variety of living and non-living self-assembled systems. The arrays of moving liquid crystal skyrmions studied here are a representative example of hierarchically organized materials that exhibit complex spatiotemporal dynamics driven by multiscale processes. Joint geometric and topological data analysis (TDA) offers a powerful framework for investigating such systems by capturing the underlying structure of the data at multiple scales. In the TDA approach, we introduce the $\Psi$-function, a robust numerical topological descriptor related to both the spatiotemporal changes in the size and shape of individual topological solitons and the emergence of regions with their different spatial organization. The geometric method based on the analysis of vector fields generated from images of skyrmion ensembles offers insights into the nonlinear physical mechanisms of the system's response to external stimuli and provides a basis for comparison with theoretical predictions. The methodology presented here is very general and can provide a characterization of system behavior both at the level of individual pattern-forming agents and as a whole, allowing one to relate the results of image data analysis to processes occurring in a physical, chemical, or biological system in the real world.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present DeepFDM, a differentiable finite-difference framework for learning spatially varying coefficients in time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). By embedding a classical forward-Euler discretization into a convolutional architecture, DeepFDM enforces stability and first-order convergence via CFL-compliant coefficient parameterizations. Model weights correspond directly to PDE coefficients, yielding an interpretable inverse-problem formulation. We evaluate DeepFDM on a benchmark suite of scalar PDEs: advection, diffusion, advection-diffusion, reaction-diffusion and inhomogeneous Burgers' equations-in one, two and three spatial dimensions. In both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tests (quantified by the Hellinger distance between coefficient priors), DeepFDM attains normalized mean-squared errors one to two orders of magnitude smaller than Fourier Neural Operators, U-Nets and ResNets; requires 10-20X fewer training epochs; and uses 5-50X fewer parameters. Moreover, recovered coefficient fields accurately match ground-truth parameters. These results establish DeepFDM as a robust, efficient, and transparent baseline for data-driven solution and identification of parametric PDEs.</description>

      <title>Generative imaging for radio interferometry with fast uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of large radio interferometric telescopes, particularly the SKA, there is a growing demand for computationally efficient image reconstruction techniques. Existing reconstruction methods, such as the CLEAN algorithm or proximal optimisation approaches, are iterative in nature, necessitating a large amount of compute. These methods either provide no uncertainty quantification or require large computational overhead to do so. Learned reconstruction methods have shown promise in providing efficient and high quality reconstruction. In this article we explore the use of generative neural networks that enable efficient approximate sampling of the posterior distribution for high quality reconstructions with uncertainty quantification. Our RI-GAN framework, builds on the regularised conditional generative adversarial network (rcGAN) framework by integrating a gradient U-Net (GU-Net) architecture - a hybrid reconstruction model that embeds the measurement operator directly into the network. This framework uses Wasserstein GANs to improve training stability in combination with regularisation terms that combat mode collapse, which are typical problems for conditional GANs. This approach takes as input the dirty image and the point spread function (PSF) of the observation and provides efficient, high-quality image reconstructions that are robust to varying visibility coverages, generalises to images with an increased dynamic range, and provides informative uncertainty quantification. Our methods provide a significant step toward computationally efficient, scalable, and uncertainty-aware imaging for next-generation radio telescopes.</description>

      <title>Predicting VBAC Outcomes from U.S. Natality Data using Deep and Classical Machine Learning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the outcome of a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) is essential for guiding prenatal counseling and minimizing delivery-related risks. This study presents supervised machine learning models for predicting vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) using 643,029 TOLAC cases from the CDC WONDER Natality dataset (2017-2023). After filtering for singleton births with one or two prior cesareans and complete data across 47 prenatal-period features, three classifiers were trained: logistic regression, XGBoost, and a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The MLP achieved the highest performance with an AUC of 0.7287, followed closely by XGBoost (AUC = 0.727), both surpassing the logistic regression baseline (AUC = 0.709). To address class imbalance, class weighting was applied to the MLP, and a custom loss function was implemented in XGBoost. Evaluation metrics included ROC curves, confusion matrices, and precision-recall analysis. Logistic regression coefficients highlighted maternal BMI, education, parity, comorbidities, and prenatal care indicators as key predictors. Overall, the results demonstrate that routinely collected, early-pregnancy variables can support scalable and moderately high-performing VBAC prediction models. These models offer potential utility in clinical decision support, particularly in settings lacking access to specialized intrapartum data.</description>

      <title>Graph neural networks for residential location choice: connection to classical logit models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Researchers have adopted deep learning for classical discrete choice analysis as it can capture complex feature relationships and achieve higher predictive performance. However, the existing deep learning approaches cannot explicitly capture the relationship among choice alternatives, which has been a long-lasting focus in classical discrete choice models. To address the gap, this paper introduces Graph Neural Network (GNN) as a novel framework to analyze residential location choice. The GNN-based discrete choice models (GNN-DCMs) offer a structured approach for neural networks to capture dependence among spatial alternatives, while maintaining clear connections to classical random utility theory. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the GNN-DCMs incorporate the nested logit (NL) model and the spatially correlated logit (SCL) model as two specific cases, yielding novel algorithmic interpretation through message passing among alternatives' utilities. Empirically, the GNN-DCMs outperform benchmark MNL, SCL, and feedforward neural networks in predicting residential location choices among Chicago's 77 community areas. Regarding model interpretation, the GNN-DCMs can capture individual heterogeneity and exhibit spatially-aware substitution patterns. Overall, these results highlight the potential of GNN-DCMs as a unified and expressive framework for synergizing discrete choice modeling and deep learning in the complex spatial choice contexts.</description>

Abstract: Adapting large Video-Language Models (VLMs) for action detection using only a few examples poses challenges like overfitting and the granularity mismatch between scene-level pre-training and required person-centric understanding. We propose an efficient adaptation strategy combining parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) with a novel learnable internal feature augmentation. Applied within the frozen VLM backbone using FiLM, these augmentations generate diverse feature variations directly relevant to the task. Additionally, we introduce a group-weighted loss function that dynamically modulates the training contribution of each augmented sample based on its prediction divergence relative to the group average. This promotes robust learning by prioritizing informative yet reasonable augmentations. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on complex multi-label, multi-person action detection datasets (AVA, MOMA), achieving strong mAP performance and showcasing significant data efficiency for adapting VLMs from limited examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir Computing is a machine learning approach that uses the rich repertoire of complex system dynamics for function approximation. Current approaches to reservoir computing use a network of coupled integrating neurons that require a steady current to maintain activity. Here, we introduce a small world graph of differentiating neurons that are active only when there are changes in input as an alternative to integrating neurons as a reservoir computing substrate. We find the coupling strength and network topology that enable these small world networks to function as an effective reservoir. We demonstrate the efficacy of these networks in the MNIST digit recognition task, achieving comparable performance of 90.65% to existing reservoir computing approaches. The findings suggest that differentiating neurons can be a potential alternative to integrating neurons and can provide a sustainable future alternative for power-hungry AI applications.</description>

      <title>Cascading and Proxy Membership Inference Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Membership Inference Attack (MIA) assesses how much a trained machine learning model reveals about its training data by determining whether specific query instances were included in the dataset. We classify existing MIAs into adaptive or non-adaptive, depending on whether the adversary is allowed to train shadow models on membership queries. In the adaptive setting, where the adversary can train shadow models after accessing query instances, we highlight the importance of exploiting membership dependencies between instances and propose an attack-agnostic framework called Cascading Membership Inference Attack (CMIA), which incorporates membership dependencies via conditional shadow training to boost membership inference performance.
  In the non-adaptive setting, where the adversary is restricted to training shadow models before obtaining membership queries, we introduce Proxy Membership Inference Attack (PMIA). PMIA employs a proxy selection strategy that identifies samples with similar behaviors to the query instance and uses their behaviors in shadow models to perform a membership posterior odds test for membership inference. We provide theoretical analyses for both attacks, and extensive experimental results demonstrate that CMIA and PMIA substantially outperform existing MIAs in both settings, particularly in the low false-positive regime, which is crucial for evaluating privacy risks.</description>

      <title>MapDiffusion: Generative Diffusion for Vectorized Online HD Map Construction and Uncertainty Estimation in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving requires an understanding of the static environment from sensor data. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries, MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution, MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous vehicles in complex environments.</description>

      <title>From Sublinear to Linear: Fast Convergence in Deep Networks via Locally Polyak-Lojasiewicz Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence of gradient descent (GD) on the non-convex loss landscapes of deep neural networks (DNNs) presents a fundamental theoretical challenge. While recent work has established that GD converges to a stationary point at a sublinear rate within locally quasi-convex regions (LQCRs), this fails to explain the exponential convergence rates consistently observed in practice. In this paper, we resolve this discrepancy by proving that under a mild assumption on Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) stability, these same regions satisfy a local Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition. We introduce the concept of a Locally Polyak-Lojasiewicz Region (LPLR), where the squared gradient norm lower-bounds the suboptimality gap, prove that properly initialized finite-width networks admit such regions around initialization, and establish that GD achieves linear convergence within an LPLR, providing the first finite-width guarantee that matches empirically observed rates. We validate our theory across diverse settings, from controlled experiments on fully-connected networks to modern ResNet architectures trained with stochastic methods, demonstrating that LPLR structure emerges robustly in practical deep learning scenarios. By rigorously connecting local landscape geometry to fast optimization through the NTK framework, our work provides a definitive theoretical explanation for the remarkable efficiency of gradient-based optimization in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Measuring Sample Quality with Copula Discrepancies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that underpin modern Bayesian machine learning, such as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD), sacrifice asymptotic exactness for computational speed, creating a critical diagnostic gap: traditional sample quality measures fail catastrophically when applied to biased samplers. While powerful Stein-based diagnostics can detect distributional mismatches, they provide no direct assessment of dependence structure, often the primary inferential target in multivariate problems. We introduce the Copula Discrepancy (CD), a principled and computationally efficient diagnostic that leverages Sklar's theorem to isolate and quantify the fidelity of a sample's dependence structure independent of its marginals. Our theoretical framework provides the first structure-aware diagnostic specifically designed for the era of approximate inference. Empirically, we demonstrate that a moment-based CD dramatically outperforms standard diagnostics like effective sample size for hyperparameter selection in biased MCMC, correctly identifying optimal configurations where traditional methods fail. Furthermore, our robust MLE-based variant can detect subtle but critical mismatches in tail dependence that remain invisible to rank correlation-based approaches, distinguishing between samples with identical Kendall's tau but fundamentally different extreme-event behavior. With computational overhead orders of magnitude lower than existing Stein discrepancies, the CD provides both immediate practical value for MCMC practitioners and a theoretical foundation for the next generation of structure-aware sample quality assessment.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement Using Pre-trained Visual Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech enhancement in audio-only settings remains challenging, particularly in the presence of interfering speakers. This paper presents a simple yet effective real-time audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) system, RAVEN, which isolates and enhances the on-screen target speaker while suppressing interfering speakers and background noise. We investigate how visual embeddings learned from audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) and active speaker detection (ASD) contribute to AVSE across different SNR conditions and numbers of interfering speakers. Our results show concatenating embeddings from AVSR and ASD models provides the greatest improvement in low-SNR, multi-speaker environments, while AVSR embeddings alone perform best in noise-only scenarios. In addition, we develop a real-time streaming system that operates on a computer CPU and we provide a video demonstration and code repository. To our knowledge, this is the first open-source implementation of a real-time AVSE system.</description>

      <title>From Global to Local: A Scalable Benchmark for Local Posterior Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Degeneracy is an inherent feature of the loss landscape of neural networks, but it is not well understood how stochastic gradient MCMC (SGMCMC) algorithms interact with this degeneracy. In particular, current global convergence guarantees for common SGMCMC algorithms rely on assumptions which are likely incompatible with degenerate loss landscapes. In this paper, we argue that this gap requires a shift in focus from global to local posterior sampling, and, as a first step, we introduce a novel scalable benchmark for evaluating the local sampling performance of SGMCMC algorithms. We evaluate a number of common algorithms, and find that RMSProp-preconditioned SGLD is most effective at faithfully representing the local geometry of the posterior distribution. Although we lack theoretical guarantees about global sampler convergence, our empirical results show that we are able to extract non-trivial local information in models with up to O(100M) parameters.</description>

      <title>Hebbian Memory-Augmented Recurrent Networks: Engram Neurons in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite success across diverse tasks, current artificial recurrent network architectures rely primarily on implicit hidden-state memories, limiting their interpretability and ability to model long-range dependencies. In contrast, biological neural systems employ explicit, associative memory traces (i.e., engrams) strengthened through Hebbian synaptic plasticity and activated sparsely during recall. Motivated by these neurobiological insights, we introduce the Engram Neural Network (ENN), a novel recurrent architecture incorporating an explicit, differentiable memory matrix with Hebbian plasticity and sparse, attention-driven retrieval mechanisms. The ENN explicitly models memory formation and recall through dynamic Hebbian traces, improving transparency and interpretability compared to conventional RNN variants. We evaluate the ENN architecture on three canonical benchmarks: MNIST digit classification, CIFAR-10 image sequence modeling, and WikiText-103 language modeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that the ENN achieves accuracy and generalization performance broadly comparable to classical RNN, GRU, and LSTM architectures, with all models converging to similar accuracy and perplexity on the large-scale WikiText-103 task. At the same time, the ENN offers significant enhancements in interpretability through observable memory dynamics. Hebbian trace visualizations further reveal biologically plausible, structured memory formation processes, validating the potential of neuroscience-inspired mechanisms to inform the development of more interpretable and robust deep learning models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forest transitions, characterized by dynamic shifts between forest, agricultural, and abandoned lands, are complex phenomena. This study developed a stochastic differential equation model to capture the intricate dynamics of these transitions. We established the existence of global positive solutions for the model and conducted numerical analyses to assess the impact of model parameters on deforestation incentives. To address the challenge of parameter estimation, we proposed a novel deep learning approach that estimates all model parameters from a single sample containing time-series observations of forest and agricultural land proportions. This innovative approach enables us to understand forest transition dynamics and deforestation trends at any future time.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional physical reservoir computing in soft tensegrity robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the dynamics of physical systems can be utilized for the desired information processing under the framework of physical reservoir computing (PRC). Robots with soft bodies are examples of such physical systems, and their nonlinear body-environment dynamics can be used to compute and generate the motor signals necessary for the control of their own behavior. In this simulation study, we extend this approach to control and embed not only one but also multiple behaviors into a type of soft robot called a tensegrity robot. The resulting system, consisting of the robot and the environment, is a multistable dynamical system that converges to different attractors from varying initial conditions. Furthermore, attractor analysis reveals that there exist "untrained attractors" in the state space of the system outside the training data. These untrained attractors reflect the intrinsic properties and structures of the tensegrity robot and its interactions with the environment. The impacts of these recent findings in PRC remain unexplored in embodied AI research. We here illustrate their potential to understand various features of embodied cognition that have not been fully addressed to date.</description>

      <title>Persona Vectors: Monitoring and Controlling Character Traits in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models interact with users through a simulated 'Assistant' persona. While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest, it sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify directions in the model's activation space-persona vectors-underlying several traits, such as evil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm that these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's personality at deployment time. We then apply persona vectors to predict and control personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both intended and unintended personality changes after finetuning are strongly correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors. These shifts can be mitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in the first place with a new preventative steering method. Moreover, persona vectors can be used to flag training data that will produce undesirable personality changes, both at the dataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for extracting persona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait of interest, given only a natural-language description.</description>

      <title>Automatic Classification of User Requirements from Online Feedback -- A Replication Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been widely applied in the requirements engineering (RE) field to support tasks such as classification and ambiguity detection. Although RE research is rooted in empirical investigation, it has paid limited attention to replicating NLP for RE (NLP4RE) studies. The rapidly advancing realm of NLP is creating new opportunities for efficient, machine-assisted workflows, which can bring new perspectives and results to the forefront. Thus, we replicate and extend a previous NLP4RE study (baseline), "Classifying User Requirements from Online Feedback in Small Dataset Environments using Deep Learning", which evaluated different deep learning models for requirement classification from user reviews. We reproduced the original results using publicly released source code, thereby helping to strengthen the external validity of the baseline study. We then extended the setup by evaluating model performance on an external dataset and comparing results to a GPT-4o zero-shot classifier. Furthermore, we prepared the replication study ID-card for the baseline study, important for evaluating replication readiness. Results showed diverse reproducibility levels across different models, with Naive Bayes demonstrating perfect reproducibility. In contrast, BERT and other models showed mixed results. Our findings revealed that baseline deep learning models, BERT and ELMo, exhibited good generalization capabilities on an external dataset, and GPT-4o showed performance comparable to traditional baseline machine learning models. Additionally, our assessment confirmed the baseline study's replication readiness; however missing environment setup files would have further enhanced readiness. We include this missing information in our replication package and provide the replication study ID-card for our study to further encourage and support the replication of our study.</description>

      <title>On Policy Stochasticity in Mutual Information Optimal Control of Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, mutual information optimal control has been proposed as an extension of maximum entropy optimal control. Both approaches introduce regularization terms to render the policy stochastic, and it is important to theoretically clarify the relationship between the temperature parameter (i.e., the coefficient of the regularization term) and the stochasticity of the policy. Unlike in maximum entropy optimal control, this relationship remains unexplored in mutual information optimal control. In this paper, we investigate this relationship for a mutual information optimal control problem (MIOCP) of discrete-time linear systems. After extending the result of a previous study of the MIOCP, we establish the existence of an optimal policy of the MIOCP, and then derive the respective conditions on the temperature parameter under which the optimal policy becomes stochastic and deterministic. Furthermore, we also derive the respective conditions on the temperature parameter under which the policy obtained by an alternating optimization algorithm becomes stochastic and deterministic. The validity of the theoretical results is demonstrated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommendation systems often suffer from data sparsity caused by limited user-item interactions, which degrade their performance and amplify popularity bias in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel data augmentation framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and item textual descriptions to enrich interaction data. By few-shot prompting LLMs multiple times to rerank items and aggregating the results via majority voting, we generate high-confidence synthetic user-item interactions, supported by theoretical guarantees based on the concentration of measure. To effectively leverage the augmented data in the context of a graph recommendation system, we integrate it into a graph contrastive learning framework to mitigate distributional shift and alleviate popularity bias. Extensive experiments show that our method improves accuracy and reduces popularity bias, outperforming strong baselines.</description>

Abstract: We develop a quantum version of the em algorithm for training quantum Boltzmann machines. The em algorithm is an information-geometric extension of the well-known expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, offering a structured alternative to gradient-based methods with potential advantages in stability and convergence. We implement the algorithm on a semi-quantum restricted Boltzmann machine, where quantum effects are confined to the hidden layer. This structure enables analytical update rules while preserving quantum expressivity. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method achieves stable learning and outperforms gradient-based training in several cases. These results demonstrate the potential of information-geometric optimization for quantum machine learning, particularly in settings where standard methods struggle due to non-commutativity or vanishing gradients.</description>

Abstract: The development of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been largely driven by ambitious challenge tasks and benchmarks. Games have dominated RL benchmarks because they present relevant challenges, are inexpensive to run and easy to understand. While games such as Go and Atari have led to many breakthroughs, they often do not directly translate to real-world embodied applications. In recognising the need to diversify RL benchmarks and addressing complexities that arise in embodied interaction scenarios, we introduce Assistax: an open-source benchmark designed to address challenges arising in assistive robotics tasks. Assistax uses JAX's hardware acceleration for significant speed-ups for learning in physics-based simulations. In terms of open-loop wall-clock time, Assistax runs up to $370\times$ faster when vectorising training runs compared to CPU-based alternatives. Assistax conceptualises the interaction between an assistive robot and an active human patient using multi-agent RL to train a population of diverse partner agents against which an embodied robotic agent's zero-shot coordination capabilities can be tested. Extensive evaluation and hyperparameter tuning for popular continuous control RL and MARL algorithms provide reliable baselines and establish Assistax as a practical benchmark for advancing RL research for assistive robotics. The code is available at: https://github.com/assistive-autonomy/assistax.</description>

      <title>Whilter: A Whisper-based Data Filter for "In-the-Wild" Speech Corpora Using Utterance-level Multi-Task Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale in-the-wild speech datasets have become more prevalent in recent years due to increased interest in models that can learn useful features from unlabelled data for tasks such as speech recognition or synthesis. These datasets often contain undesirable features, such as multiple speakers, non-target languages, and music, which may impact model learning. The Whilter model is proposed as a multitask solution to identify these undesirable samples. Whilter uses a Whisper encoder with an attention-based classifier to solve five diverse classification problems at once. In addition, an annotated dataset is published for a subset of two popular in-the-wild corpora. Whilter achieves F1 scores above 85% and equal error rates of 6.5% to 7.8% for three of five subtasks, outperforming a state-of-the-art BEATs classifier on speech-specific classes, with a notable decrease in processing time compared to a combination of single-task alternatives.</description>

      <title>diffSPH: Differentiable Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics for Adjoint Optimization and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present diffSPH, a novel open-source differentiable Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) framework developed entirely in PyTorch with GPU acceleration. diffSPH is designed centrally around differentiation to facilitate optimization and machine learning (ML) applications in Computational Fluid Dynamics~(CFD), including training neural networks and the development of hybrid models. Its differentiable SPH core, and schemes for compressible (with shock capturing and multi-phase flows), weakly compressible (with boundary handling and free-surface flows), and incompressible physics, enable a broad range of application areas. We demonstrate the framework's unique capabilities through several applications, including addressing particle shifting via a novel, target-oriented approach by minimizing physical and regularization loss terms, a task often intractable in traditional solvers. Further examples include optimizing initial conditions and physical parameters to match target trajectories, shape optimization, implementing a solver-in-the-loop setup to emulate higher-order integration, and demonstrating gradient propagation through hundreds of full simulation steps. Prioritizing readability, usability, and extensibility, this work offers a foundational platform for the CFD community to develop and deploy novel neural networks and adjoint optimization applications.</description>

      <title>An Equal-Probability Partition of the Sample Space: A Non-parametric Inference from Finite Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates what can be inferred about an arbitrary continuous probability distribution from a finite sample of $N$ observations drawn from it. The central finding is that the $N$ sorted sample points partition the real line into $N+1$ segments, each carrying an expected probability mass of exactly $1/(N+1)$. This non-parametric result, which follows from fundamental properties of order statistics, holds regardless of the underlying distribution's shape. This equal-probability partition yields a discrete entropy of $\log_2(N+1)$ bits, which quantifies the information gained from the sample and contrasts with Shannon's results for continuous variables. I compare this partition-based framework to the conventional ECDF and discuss its implications for robust non-parametric inference, particularly in density and tail estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tree tensor networks (TTNs) are widely used in low-rank approximation and quantum many-body simulation. In this work, we present a formal analysis of the differential geometry underlying TTNs. Building on this foundation, we develop efficient first- and second-order optimization algorithms that exploit the intrinsic quotient structure of TTNs. Additionally, we devise a backpropagation algorithm for training TTNs in a kernel learning setting. We validate our methods through numerical experiments on a representative machine learning task.</description>

      <title>Generalized few-shot transfer learning architecture for modeling the EDFA gain spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of the gain spectrum in Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFAs) is essential for optimizing optical network performance, particularly as networks evolve toward multi-vendor solutions. In this work, we propose a generalized few-shot transfer learning architecture based on a Semi-Supervised Self-Normalizing Neural Network (SS-NN) that leverages internal EDFA features - such as VOA input or output power and attenuation, to improve gain spectrum prediction. Our SS-NN model employs a two-phase training strategy comprising unsupervised pre-training with noise-augmented measurements and supervised fine-tuning with a custom weighted MSE loss. Furthermore, we extend the framework with transfer learning (TL) techniques that enable both homogeneous (same-feature space) and heterogeneous (different-feature sets) model adaptation across booster, preamplifier, and ILA EDFAs. To address feature mismatches in heterogeneous TL, we incorporate a covariance matching loss to align second-order feature statistics between source and target domains. Extensive experiments conducted across 26 EDFAs in the COSMOS and Open Ireland testbeds demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the number of measurements requirements on the system while achieving lower mean absolute errors and improved error distributions compared to benchmark methods.</description>

      <title>Improving Neural Network Training using Dynamic Learning Rate Schedule for PINNs and Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training neural networks can be challenging, especially as the complexity of the problem increases. Despite using wider or deeper networks, training them can be a tedious process, especially if a wrong choice of the hyperparameter is made. The learning rate is one of such crucial hyperparameters, which is usually kept static during the training process. Learning dynamics in complex systems often requires a more adaptive approach to the learning rate. This adaptability becomes crucial to effectively navigate varying gradients and optimize the learning process during the training process. In this paper, a dynamic learning rate scheduler (DLRS) algorithm is presented that adapts the learning rate based on the loss values calculated during the training process. Experiments are conducted on problems related to physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and image classification using multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed DLRS accelerates training and improves stability.</description>

      <title>Unified machine-learning framework for property prediction and time-evolution simulation of strained alloy microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified machine-learning framework designed to conveniently tackle the temporal evolution of alloy microstructures under the influence of an elastic field. This approach allows for the simultaneous extraction of elastic parameters from a short trajectory and for the prediction of further microstructure evolution under their influence. This is demonstrated by focusing on spinodal decomposition in the presence of a lattice mismatch eta, and by carrying out an extensive comparison between the ground-truth evolution supplied by phase field simulations and the predictions of suitable convolutional recurrent neural network architectures. The two tasks may then be performed subsequently into a cascade framework. Under a wide spectrum of misfit conditions, the here-presented cascade model accurately predicts eta and the full corresponding microstructure evolution, also when approaching critical conditions for spinodal decomposition. Scalability to larger computational domain sizes and mild extrapolation errors in time (for time sequences five times longer than the sampled ones during training) are demonstrated. The proposed framework is general and can be applied beyond the specific, prototypical system considered here as an example. Intriguingly, experimental videos could be used to infer unknown external parameters, prior to simulating further temporal evolution.</description>

      <title>Learning Kinetic Monte Carlo stochastic dynamics with Deep Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) may be fruitfully exploited to learn stochastic dynamics, surrogating traditional models while capturing thermal fluctuations. Specifically, we showcase the application to a two-dimensional, many-particle system, focusing on surface-step fluctuations and on the related time-dependent roughness. After the construction of a dataset based on Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, a conditional GAN is trained to propagate stochastically the state of the system in time, allowing the generation of new sequences with a reduced computational cost. Modifications with respect to standard GANs, which facilitate convergence and increase accuracy, are discussed. The trained network is demonstrated to quantitatively reproduce equilibrium and kinetic properties, including scaling laws, with deviations of a few percent from the exact value. Extrapolation limits and future perspectives are critically discussed.</description>

      <title>Domain Generalization and Adaptation in Intensive Care with Anchor Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of predictive models in clinical settings often degrades when deployed in new hospitals due to distribution shifts. This paper presents a large-scale study of causality-inspired domain generalization on heterogeneous multi-center intensive care unit (ICU) data. We apply anchor regression and introduce anchor boosting, a novel, tree-based nonlinear extension, to a large dataset comprising 400,000 patients from nine distinct ICU databases. The anchor regularization consistently improves out-of-distribution performance, particularly for the most dissimilar target domains. The methods appear robust to violations of theoretical assumptions, such as anchor exogeneity. Furthermore, we propose a novel conceptual framework to quantify the utility of large external data datasets. By evaluating performance as a function of available target-domain data, we identify three regimes: (i) a domain generalization regime, where only the external model should be used, (ii) a domain adaptation regime, where refitting the external model is optimal, and (iii) a data-rich regime, where external data provides no additional value.</description>

      <title>MIBoost: A Gradient Boosting Algorithm for Variable Selection After Multiple Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical learning methods for automated variable selection, such as LASSO, elastic nets, or gradient boosting, have become increasingly popular tools for building powerful prediction models. Yet, in practice, analyses are often complicated by missing data. The most widely used approach to address missingness is multiple imputation, which creates several completed datasets. However, there is an ongoing debate on how to perform model selection in the presence of multiple imputed datasets. Simple strategies, such as pooling models across datasets, have been shown to have suboptimal properties. Although more sophisticated methods exist, they are often difficult to implement and therefore not widely applied. In contrast, two recent approaches modify the regularization methods LASSO and elastic nets by defining a single loss function, resulting in a unified set of coefficients across imputations. Our key contribution is to extend this principle to the framework of component-wise gradient boosting by proposing MIBoost, a novel algorithm that employs a uniform variable-selection mechanism across imputed datasets. Simulation studies suggest that our approach yields prediction performance comparable to that of these recently proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Introducing HALC: A general pipeline for finding optimal prompting strategies for automated coding with LLMs in the computational social sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs are seeing widespread use for task automation, including automated coding in the social sciences. However, even though researchers have proposed different prompting strategies, their effectiveness varies across LLMs and tasks. Often trial and error practices are still widespread. We propose HALC$-$a general pipeline that allows for the systematic and reliable construction of optimal prompts for any given coding task and model, permitting the integration of any prompting strategy deemed relevant. To investigate LLM coding and validate our pipeline, we sent a total of 1,512 individual prompts to our local LLMs in over two million requests. We test prompting strategies and LLM task performance based on few expert codings (ground truth). When compared to these expert codings, we find prompts that code reliably for single variables (${\alpha}$climate = .76; ${\alpha}$movement = .78) and across two variables (${\alpha}$climate = .71; ${\alpha}$movement = .74) using the LLM Mistral NeMo. Our prompting strategies are set up in a way that aligns the LLM to our codebook$-$we are not optimizing our codebook for LLM friendliness. Our paper provides insights into the effectiveness of different prompting strategies, crucial influencing factors, and the identification of reliable prompts for each coding task and model.</description>

      <title>Representations in vision and language converge in a shared, multidimensional space of perceived similarities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans can effortlessly describe what they see, yet establishing a shared representational format between vision and language remains a significant challenge. Emerging evidence suggests that human brain representations in both vision and language are well predicted by semantic feature spaces obtained from large language models (LLMs). This raises the possibility that sensory systems converge in their inherent ability to transform their inputs onto shared, embedding-like representational space. However, it remains unclear how such a space manifests in human behaviour. To investigate this, sixty-three participants performed behavioural similarity judgements separately on 100 natural scene images and 100 corresponding sentence captions from the Natural Scenes Dataset. We found that visual and linguistic similarity judgements not only converge at the behavioural level but also predict a remarkably similar network of fMRI brain responses evoked by viewing the natural scene images. Furthermore, computational models trained to map images onto LLM-embeddings outperformed both category-trained and AlexNet controls in explaining the behavioural similarity structure. These findings demonstrate that human visual and linguistic similarity judgements are grounded in a shared, modality-agnostic representational structure that mirrors how the visual system encodes experience. The convergence between sensory and artificial systems suggests a common capacity of how conceptual representations are formed-not as arbitrary products of first order, modality-specific input, but as structured representations that reflect the stable, relational properties of the external world.</description>

      <title>Efficient Pain Recognition via Respiration Signals: A Single Cross-Attention Transformer Multi-Window Fusion Pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21886v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pain is a complex condition affecting a large portion of the population. Accurate and consistent evaluation is essential for individuals experiencing pain, and it supports the development of effective and advanced management strategies. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and support clinical decision-making, aiming to reduce distress and prevent functional decline. This study has been submitted to the \textit{Second Multimodal Sensing Grand Challenge for Next-Gen Pain Assessment (AI4PAIN)}. The proposed method introduces a pipeline that leverages respiration as the input signal and incorporates a highly efficient cross-attention transformer alongside a multi-windowing strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that respiration is a valuable physiological modality for pain assessment. Moreover, experiments revealed that compact and efficient models, when properly optimized, can achieve strong performance, often surpassing larger counterparts. The proposed multi-window approach effectively captures both short-term and long-term features, as well as global characteristics, thereby enhancing the model's representational capacity.</description>

      <title>Data-driven quantum Koopman method for simulating nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation offers potential exponential speedups for simulating certain physical systems, but its application to nonlinear dynamics is inherently constrained by the requirement of unitary evolution. We propose the quantum Koopman method (QKM), a data-driven framework that bridges this gap through transforming nonlinear dynamics into linear unitary evolution in higher-dimensional observable spaces. Leveraging the Koopman operator theory to achieve a global linearization, our approach maps system states into a hierarchy of Hilbert spaces using a deep autoencoder. Within the linearized embedding spaces, the state representation is decomposed into modulus and phase components, and the evolution is governed by a set of unitary Koopman operators that act exclusively on the phase. These operators are constructed from diagonal Hamiltonians with coefficients learned from data, a structure designed for efficient implementation on quantum hardware. This architecture enables direct multi-step prediction, and the operator's computational complexity scales logarithmically with the observable space dimension. The QKM is validated across diverse nonlinear systems. Its predictions maintain relative errors below 6% for reaction-diffusion systems and shear flows, and capture key statistics in 2D turbulence. This work establishes a practical pathway for quantum-accelerated simulation of nonlinear phenomena, exploring a framework built on the synergy between deep learning for global linearization and quantum algorithms for unitary dynamics evolution.</description>

      <title>LLM-based Content Classification Approach for GitHub Repositories by the README Files</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GitHub is the world's most popular platform for storing, sharing, and managing code. Every GitHub repository has a README file associated with it. The README files should contain project-related information as per the recommendations of GitHub to support the usage and improvement of repositories. However, GitHub repository owners sometimes neglected these recommendations. This prevents a GitHub repository from reaching its full potential. This research posits that the comprehensiveness of a GitHub repository's README file significantly influences its adoption and utilization, with a lack of detail potentially hindering its full potential for widespread engagement and impact within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great performance in many text-based tasks including text classification, text generation, text summarization and text translation. In this study, an approach is developed to fine-tune LLMs for automatically classifying different sections of GitHub README files. Three encoder-only LLMs are utilized, including BERT, DistilBERT and RoBERTa. These pre-trained models are then fine-tuned based on a gold-standard dataset consisting of 4226 README file sections. This approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and has achieved an overall F1 score of 0.98. Moreover, we have also investigated the use of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and shown an economical alternative to full fine-tuning without compromising much performance. The results demonstrate the potential of using LLMs in designing an automatic classifier for categorizing the content of GitHub README files. Consequently, this study contributes to the development of automated tools for GitHub repositories to improve their identifications and potential usages.</description>

      <title>Reducing Data Requirements for Sequence-Property Prediction in Copolymer Compatibilizers via Deep Neural Network Tuning</title>

Abstract: Synthetic sequence-controlled polymers promise to transform polymer science by combining the chemical versatility of synthetic polymers with the precise sequence-mediated functionality of biological proteins. However, design of these materials has proven extraordinarily challenging, because they lack the massive datasets of closely related evolved molecules that accelerate design of proteins. Here we report on a new Artifical Intelligence strategy to dramatically reduce the amount of data necessary to accelerate these materials' design. We focus on data connecting the repeat-unit-sequence of a \emph{compatibilizer} molecule to its ability to reduce the interfacial tension between distinct polymer domains. The optimal sequence of these molecules, which are essential for applications such as mixed-waste polymer recycling, depends strongly on variables such as concentration and chemical details of the polymer. With current methods, this would demand an entirely distinct dataset to enable design at each condition. Here we show that a deep neural network trained on low-fidelity data for sequence/interfacial tension relations at one set of conditions can be rapidly tuned to make higher-fidelity predictions at a distinct set of conditions, requiring far less data that would ordinarily be needed. This priming-and-tuning approach should allow a single low-fidelity parent dataset to dramatically accelerate prediction and design in an entire constellation of related systems. In the long run, it may also provide an approach to bootstrapping quantitative atomistic design with AI insights from fast, coarse simulations.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Deepfake Detectors in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deepfakes powered by advanced machine learning models present a significant and evolving threat to identity verification and the authenticity of digital media. Although numerous detectors have been developed to address this problem, their effectiveness has yet to be tested when applied to real-world data. In this work we evaluate modern deepfake detectors, introducing a novel testing procedure designed to mimic real-world scenarios for deepfake detection. Using state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods, we create a comprehensive dataset containing more than 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. Our analysis shows that detecting deepfakes still remains a challenging task. The evaluation shows that in fewer than half of the deepfake detectors tested achieved an AUC score greater than 60%, with the lowest being 50%. We demonstrate that basic image manipulations, such as JPEG compression or image enhancement, can significantly reduce model performance. All code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/messlav/Deepfake-Detectors-in-the-Wild.</description>

      <title>DeepGo: Predictive Directed Greybox Fuzzing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art DGF techniques redefine and optimize the fitness metric to reach the target sites precisely and quickly. However, optimizations for fitness metrics are mainly based on heuristic algorithms, which usually rely on historical execution information and lack foresight on paths that have not been exercised yet. Thus, those hard-to-execute paths with complex constraints would hinder DGF from reaching the targets, making DGF less efficient. In this paper, we propose DeepGo, a predictive directed grey-box fuzzer that can combine historical and predicted information to steer DGF to reach the target site via an optimal path. We first propose the path transition model, which models DGF as a process of reaching the target site through specific path transition sequences. The new seed generated by mutation would cause the path transition, and the path corresponding to the high-reward path transition sequence indicates a high likelihood of reaching the target site through it. Then, to predict the path transitions and the corresponding rewards, we use deep neural networks to construct a Virtual Ensemble Environment (VEE), which gradually imitates the path transition model and predicts the rewards of path transitions that have not been taken yet. To determine the optimal path, we develop a Reinforcement Learning for Fuzzing (RLF) model to generate the transition sequences with the highest sequence rewards. The RLF model can combine historical and predicted path transitions to generate the optimal path transition sequences, along with the policy to guide the mutation strategy of fuzzing. Finally, to exercise the high-reward path transition sequence, we propose the concept of an action group, which comprehensively optimizes the critical steps of fuzzing to realize the optimal path to reach the target efficiently.</description>

      <title>Thou Shalt Not Prompt: Zero-Shot Human Activity Recognition in Smart Homes via Language Modeling of Sensor Data &amp; Activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing zero-shot human activity recognition (HAR) methods is a critical direction in smart home research -- considering its impact on making HAR systems work across smart homes having diverse sensing modalities, layouts, and activities of interest. The state-of-the-art solutions along this direction are based on generating natural language descriptions of the sensor data and feeding it via a carefully crafted prompt to the LLM to perform classification. Despite their performance guarantees, such ``prompt-the-LLM'' approaches carry several risks, including privacy invasion, reliance on an external service, and inconsistent predictions due to version changes, making a case for alternative zero-shot HAR methods that do not require prompting the LLMs. In this paper, we propose one such solution that models sensor data and activities using natural language, leveraging its embeddings to perform zero-shot classification and thereby bypassing the need to prompt the LLMs for activity predictions. The impact of our work lies in presenting a detailed case study on six datasets, highlighting how language modeling can bolster HAR systems in zero-shot recognition.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Kuramoto Oscillator Network for Dense Associative Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks of phase oscillators can serve as dense associative memories if they incorporate higher-order coupling beyond the classical Kuramoto model's pairwise interactions. Here we introduce a generalized Kuramoto model with combined second-harmonic (pairwise) and fourth-harmonic (quartic) coupling, inspired by dense Hopfield memory theory. Using mean-field theory and its dynamical approximation, we obtain a phase diagram for dense associative memory model that exhibits a tricritical point at which the continuous onset of memory retrieval is supplanted by a discontinuous, hysteretic transition. In the quartic-dominated regime, the system supports bistable phase-locked states corresponding to stored memory patterns, with a sizable energy barrier between memory and incoherent states. We analytically determine this bistable region and show that the escape time from a memory state (due to noise) grows exponentially with network size, indicating robust storage. Extending the theory to finite memory load, we show that higher-order couplings achieve superlinear scaling of memory capacity with system size, far exceeding the limit of pairwise-only oscillators. Large-scale simulations of the oscillator network confirm our theoretical predictions, demonstrating rapid pattern retrieval and robust storage of many phase patterns. These results bridge the Kuramoto synchronization with modern Hopfield memories, pointing toward experimental realization of high-capacity, analog associative memory in oscillator systems.</description>

      <title>Staining and locking computer vision models without retraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce new methods of staining and locking computer vision models, to protect their owners' intellectual property. Staining, also known as watermarking, embeds secret behaviour into a model which can later be used to identify it, while locking aims to make a model unusable unless a secret trigger is inserted into input images. Unlike existing methods, our algorithms can be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning or retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their worst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly modifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the (unlocked) model's performance. Locked models are unlocked by inserting a small `trigger patch' into the corner of the input image. We present experimental results showing the efficacy of our methods and demonstrating their practical performance on a variety of computer vision models.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Stratified Space Structure of an RL Game with the Volume Growth Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the structure of the embedding space of a transformer model trained for playing a particular reinforcement learning (RL) game. Specifically, we investigate how a transformer-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) model embeds visual inputs in a simple environment where an agent must collect "coins" while avoiding dynamic obstacles consisting of "spotlights." By adapting Robinson et al.'s study of the volume growth transform for LLMs to the RL setting, we find that the token embedding space for our visual coin collecting game is also not a manifold, and is better modeled as a stratified space, where local dimension can vary from point to point. We further strengthen Robinson's method by proving that fairly general volume growth curves can be realized by stratified spaces. Finally, we carry out an analysis that suggests that as an RL agent acts, its latent representation alternates between periods of low local dimension, while following a fixed sub-strategy, and bursts of high local dimension, where the agent achieves a sub-goal (e.g., collecting an object) or where the environmental complexity increases (e.g., more obstacles appear). Consequently, our work suggests that the distribution of dimensions in a stratified latent space may provide a new geometric indicator of complexity for RL games.</description>

      <title>UserBench: An Interactive Gym Environment for User-Centric Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents have made impressive progress in reasoning and tool use, enabling them to solve complex tasks. However, their ability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague, evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally, requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only 20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task executors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive environment to measure and advance this critical capability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, the increasing volume of data and the demand to solve more and more complex computational challenges are two driving forces for improving the efficiency of data storage, processing and analysis. Quantum image processing (QIP) is an interdisciplinary field between quantum information science and image processing, which has the potential to alleviate some of these challenges by leveraging the power of quantum computing. In this work, we compare and examine the compression properties of four different Quantum Image Representations (QImRs): namely, Tensor Network Representation (TNR), Flexible Representation of Quantum Image (FRQI), Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation NEQR, and Quantum Probability Image Encoding (QPIE). Our simulations show that FRQI performs a higher compression of image information than TNR, NEQR, and QPIE. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-off between accuracy and memory in binary classification problems, evaluating the performance of quantum kernels based on QImRs compared to the classical linear kernel. Our results indicate that quantum kernels provide comparable classification average accuracy but require exponentially fewer resources for image storage.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical mixtures of Gaussians for combined dimensionality reduction and clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.04841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce hierarchical mixtures of Gaussians (HMoGs), which unify dimensionality reduction and clustering into a single probabilistic model. HMoGs provide closed-form expressions for the model likelihood, exact inference over latent states and cluster membership, and exact algorithms for maximum-likelihood optimization. The novel exponential family parameterization of HMoGs greatly reduces their computational complexity relative to similar model-based methods, allowing them to efficiently model hundreds of latent dimensions, and thereby capture additional structure in high-dimensional data. We demonstrate HMoGs on synthetic experiments and MNIST, and show how joint optimization of dimensionality reduction and clustering facilitates increased model performance. We also explore how sparsity-constrained dimensionality reduction can further improve clustering performance while encouraging interpretability. By bridging classical statistical modelling with the scale of modern data and compute, HMoGs offer a practical approach to high-dimensional clustering that preserves statistical rigour, interpretability, and uncertainty quantification that is often missing from embedding-based, variational, and self-supervised methods.</description>

      <title>Quantize Once, Train Fast: Allreduce-Compatible Compression with Provable Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed training enables large-scale deep learning, but suffers from high communication overhead, especially as models and datasets grow. Gradient compression, particularly quantization, is a promising approach to mitigate this bottleneck. However, existing quantization schemes are often incompatible with Allreduce, the dominant communication primitive in distributed deep learning, and many prior solutions rely on heuristics without theoretical guarantees. We introduce Global-QSGD, an Allreduce-compatible gradient quantization method that leverages global norm scaling to reduce communication overhead while preserving accuracy. Global-QSGD is backed by rigorous theoretical analysis, extending standard unbiased compressor frameworks to establish formal convergence guarantees. Additionally, we develop a performance model to evaluate its impact across different hardware configurations. Extensive experiments on NVLink, PCIe, and large-scale cloud environments show that Global-QSGD accelerates distributed training by up to 3.51% over baseline quantization methods, making it a practical and efficient solution for large-scale deep learning workloads.</description>

Abstract: The widespread integration of Machine Learning systems in daily life, particularly in high-stakes domains, has raised concerns about the fairness implications. While prior works have investigated static fairness measures, recent studies reveal that automated decision-making has long-term implications and that off-the-shelf fairness approaches may not serve the purpose of achieving long-term fairness. Additionally, the existence of feedback loops and the interaction between models and the environment introduces additional complexities that may deviate from the initial fairness goals. In this survey, we review existing literature on long-term fairness from different perspectives and present a taxonomy for long-term fairness studies. We highlight key challenges and consider future research directions, analyzing both current issues and potential further explorations.</description>

      <title>MALLM-GAN: Multi-Agent Large Language Model as Generative Adversarial Network for Synthesizing Tabular Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10521v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of big data, access to abundant data is crucial for driving research forward. However, such data is often inaccessible due to privacy concerns or high costs, particularly in healthcare domain. Generating synthetic (tabular) data can address this, but existing models typically require substantial amounts of data to train effectively, contradicting our objective to solve data scarcity. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework to generate synthetic tabular data, powered by large language models (LLMs) that emulates the architecture of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). By incorporating data generation process as contextual information and utilizing LLM as the optimizer, our approach significantly enhance the quality of synthetic data generation in common scenarios with small sample sizes. Our experimental results on public and private datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state-of-art models regarding generating higher quality synthetic data for downstream tasks while keeping privacy of the real data.</description>

      <title>Latent Adversarial Training Improves Robustness to Persistent Harmful Behaviors in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can often be made to behave in undesirable ways that they are explicitly fine-tuned not to. For example, the LLM red-teaming literature has produced a wide variety of 'jailbreaking' techniques to elicit harmful text from models that were fine-tuned to be harmless. Recent work on red-teaming, model editing, and interpretability suggests that this challenge stems from how (adversarial) fine-tuning largely serves to suppress rather than remove undesirable capabilities from LLMs. Prior work has introduced latent adversarial training (LAT) as a way to improve robustness to broad classes of failures. These prior works have considered untargeted latent space attacks where the adversary perturbs latent activations to maximize loss on examples of desirable behavior. Untargeted LAT can provide a generic type of robustness but does not leverage information about specific failure modes. Here, we experiment with targeted LAT where the adversary seeks to minimize loss on a specific competing task. We find that it can augment a wide variety of state-of-the-art methods. First, we use targeted LAT to improve robustness to jailbreaks, outperforming a strong R2D2 baseline with orders of magnitude less compute. Second, we use it to more effectively remove backdoors with no knowledge of the trigger. Finally, we use it to more effectively unlearn knowledge for specific undesirable tasks in a way that is also more robust to re-learning. Overall, our results suggest that targeted LAT can be an effective tool for defending against harmful behaviors from LLMs.</description>

      <title>Persistent Backdoor Attacks in Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13864v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to neural networks, enabling adversaries to manipulate model outputs on specific inputs, often with devastating consequences, especially in critical applications. While backdoor attacks have been studied in various contexts, little attention has been given to their practicality and persistence in continual learning, particularly in understanding how the continual updates to model parameters, as new data distributions are learned and integrated, impact the effectiveness of these attacks over time. To address this gap, we introduce two persistent backdoor attacks-Blind Task Backdoor and Latent Task Backdoor-each leveraging minimal adversarial influence. Our blind task backdoor subtly alters the loss computation without direct control over the training process, while the latent task backdoor influences only a single task's training, with all other tasks trained benignly. We evaluate these attacks under various configurations, demonstrating their efficacy with static, dynamic, physical, and semantic triggers. Our results show that both attacks consistently achieve high success rates across different continual learning algorithms, while effectively evading state-of-the-art defenses, such as SentiNet and I-BAU.</description>

      <title>Recovering Manifold Structure Using Ollivier-Ricci Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce ORC-ManL, a new algorithm to prune spurious edges from nearest neighbor graphs using a criterion based on Ollivier-Ricci curvature and estimated metric distortion. Our motivation comes from manifold learning: we show that when the data generating the nearest-neighbor graph consists of noisy samples from a low-dimensional manifold, edges that shortcut through the ambient space have more negative Ollivier-Ricci curvature than edges that lie along the data manifold. We demonstrate that our method outperforms alternative pruning methods and that it significantly improves performance on many downstream geometric data analysis tasks that use nearest neighbor graphs as input. Specifically, we evaluate on manifold learning, persistent homology, dimension estimation, and others. We also show that ORC-ManL can be used to improve clustering and manifold learning of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Finally, we provide empirical convergence experiments that support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Local Attention Mechanism: Boosting the Transformer Architecture for Long-Sequence Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers have become the leading choice in natural language processing over other deep learning architectures. This trend has also permeated the field of time series analysis, especially for long-horizon forecasting, showcasing promising results both in performance and running time.
  In this paper, we introduce Local Attention Mechanism (LAM), an efficient attention mechanism tailored for time series analysis. This mechanism exploits the continuity properties of time series to reduce the number of attention scores computed. We present an algorithm for implementing LAM in tensor algebra that runs in time and memory O(nlogn), significantly improving upon the O(n^2) time and memory complexity of traditional attention mechanisms. We also note the lack of proper datasets to evaluate long-horizon forecast models. Thus, we propose a novel set of datasets to improve the evaluation of models addressing long-horizon forecasting challenges.
  Our experimental analysis demonstrates that the vanilla transformer architecture magnified with LAM surpasses state-of-the-art models, including the vanilla attention mechanism. These results confirm the effectiveness of our approach and highlight a range of future challenges in long-sequence time series forecasting.</description>

      <title>Can sparse autoencoders make sense of gene expression latent variable models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have lately been used to uncover interpretable latent features in large language models. By projecting dense embeddings into a much higher-dimensional and sparse space, learned features become disentangled and easier to interpret. This work explores the potential of SAEs for decomposing embeddings in complex and high-dimensional biological data. Using simulated data, it outlines the efficacy, hyperparameter landscape, and limitations of SAEs when it comes to extracting ground truth generative variables from latent space. The application to embeddings from pretrained single-cell models shows that SAEs can find and steer key biological processes and even uncover subtle biological signals that might otherwise be missed. This work further introduces scFeatureLens, an automated interpretability approach for linking SAE features and biological concepts from gene sets to enable large-scale analysis and hypothesis generation in single-cell gene expression models.</description>

      <title>Generalists vs. Specialists: Evaluating LLMs on Highly-Constrained Biophysical Sequence Optimization Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22296v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in biomolecule optimization problems, they incur heavy computational costs and struggle to satisfy precise constraints. On the other hand, specialized solvers like LaMBO-2 offer efficiency and fine-grained control but require more domain expertise. Comparing these approaches is challenging due to expensive laboratory validation and inadequate synthetic benchmarks. We address this by introducing Ehrlich functions, a synthetic test suite that captures the geometric structure of biophysical sequence optimization problems. With prompting alone, off-the-shelf LLMs struggle to optimize Ehrlich functions. In response, we propose LLOME (Language Model Optimization with Margin Expectation), a bilevel optimization routine for online black-box optimization. When combined with a novel preference learning loss, we find LLOME can not only learn to solve some Ehrlich functions, but can even perform as well as or better than LaMBO-2 on moderately difficult Ehrlich variants. However, LLMs also exhibit some likelihood-reward miscalibration and struggle without explicit rewards. Our results indicate LLMs can occasionally provide significant benefits, but specialized solvers are still competitive and incur less overhead.</description>

      <title>HI-PMK: A Data-Dependent Kernel for Incomplete Heterogeneous Data Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Handling incomplete and heterogeneous data remains a central challenge in real-world machine learning, where missing values may follow complex mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR) and features can be of mixed types (numerical and categorical). Existing methods often rely on imputation, which may introduce bias or privacy risks, or fail to jointly address data heterogeneity and structured missingness. We propose the \textbf{H}eterogeneous \textbf{I}ncomplete \textbf{P}robability \textbf{M}ass \textbf{K}ernel (\textbf{HI-PMK}), a novel data-dependent representation learning approach that eliminates the need for imputation. HI-PMK introduces two key innovations: (1) a probability mass-based dissimilarity measure that adapts to local data distributions across heterogeneous features (numerical, ordinal, nominal), and (2) a missingness-aware uncertainty strategy (MaxU) that conservatively handles all three missingness mechanisms by assigning maximal plausible dissimilarity to unobserved entries. Our approach is privacy-preserving, scalable, and readily applicable to downstream tasks such as classification and clustering. Extensive experiments on over 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that HI-PMK consistently outperforms traditional imputation-based pipelines and kernel methods across a wide range of missing data settings.

      <title>Wavelet Meets Adam: Compressing Gradients for Memory-Efficient Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a range of natural language processing tasks. However, their vast number of parameters introduces significant memory challenges during training, particularly when using memory-intensive optimizers like Adam. Existing memory-efficient algorithms often rely on techniques such as singular value decomposition projection or weight freezing. While these approaches help alleviate memory constraints, they generally produce suboptimal results compared to full-rank updates. In this paper, we investigate the memory-efficient method beyond low-rank training, proposing a novel solution called Gradient Wavelet Transform (GWT), which applies wavelet transforms to gradients in order to significantly reduce the memory requirements for maintaining optimizer states. We demonstrate that GWT can be seamlessly integrated with memory-intensive optimizers, enabling efficient training without sacrificing performance. Through extensive experiments on both pre-training and fine-tuning tasks, we show that GWT achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with advanced memory-efficient optimizers and full-rank approaches in terms of both memory usage and training performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific research faces high costs and inefficiencies with traditional methods, but the rise of deep learning and large language models (LLMs) offers innovative solutions. This survey reviews transformer-based LLM applications across scientific fields such as biology, medicine, chemistry, and meteorology, underscoring their role in advancing research. However, the continuous expansion of model size has led to significant memory demands, hindering further development and application of LLMs for science. This survey systematically reviews and categorizes memory-efficient pre-training techniques for large-scale transformers, including algorithm-level, system-level, and hardware-software co-optimization. Using AlphaFold 2 as an example, we demonstrate how tailored memory optimization methods can reduce storage needs while preserving prediction accuracy. By bridging model efficiency and scientific application needs, we hope to provide insights for scalable and cost-effective LLM training in AI for science.</description>

      <title>PAR-AdvGAN: Improving Adversarial Attack Capability with Progressive Auto-Regression AdvGAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains. However, they are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can lead to erroneous predictions. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can leverage the generators and discriminators model to quickly produce high-quality adversarial examples. Since both modules train in a competitive and simultaneous manner, GAN-based algorithms like AdvGAN can generate adversarial examples with better transferability compared to traditional methods. However, the generation of perturbations is usually limited to a single iteration, preventing these examples from fully exploiting the potential of the methods. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel approach named Progressive Auto-Regression AdvGAN (PAR-AdvGAN). It incorporates an auto-regressive iteration mechanism within a progressive generation network to craft adversarial examples with enhanced attack capability. We thoroughly evaluate our PAR-AdvGAN method with a large-scale experiment, demonstrating its superior performance over various state-of-the-art black-box adversarial attacks, as well as the original AdvGAN.Moreover, PAR-AdvGAN significantly accelerates the adversarial example generation, i.e., achieving the speeds of up to 335.5 frames per second on Inception-v3 model, outperforming the gradient-based transferable attack algorithms.

      <title>Multi-branch of Attention Yields Accurate Results for Tabular Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tabular data inherently exhibits significant feature heterogeneity, but existing transformer-based methods lack specialized mechanisms to handle this property. To bridge the gap, we propose MAYA, an encoder-decoder transformer-based framework. In the encoder, we design a Multi-Branch of Attention (MBA) that constructs multiple parallel attention branches and averages the features at each branch, effectively fusing heterogeneous features while limiting parameter growth. Additionally, we employ collaborative learning with a dynamic consistency weight constraint to produce more robust representations. In the decoder stage, cross-attention is utilized to seamlessly integrate tabular data with corresponding label features. This dual-attention mechanism effectively captures both intra-instance and inter-instance interactions. We evaluate the proposed method on a wide range of datasets and compare it with other state-of-the-art transformer-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance among transformer-based methods in both tabular classification and regression tasks.</description>

      <title>A calibration test for evaluating set-based epistemic uncertainty representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate representation of epistemic uncertainty is a challenging yet essential task in machine learning. A widely used representation corresponds to convex sets of probabilistic predictors, also known as credal sets. One popular way of constructing these credal sets is via ensembling or specialized supervised learning methods, where the epistemic uncertainty can be quantified through measures such as the set size or the disagreement among members. In principle, these sets should contain the true data-generating distribution. As a necessary condition for this validity, we adopt the strongest notion of calibration as a proxy. Concretely, we propose a novel statistical test to determine whether there is a convex combination of the set's predictions that is calibrated in distribution. In contrast to previous methods, our framework allows the convex combination to be instance dependent, recognizing that different ensemble members may be better calibrated in different regions of the input space. Moreover, we learn this combination via proper scoring rules, which inherently optimize for calibration. Building on differentiable, kernel-based estimators of calibration errors, we introduce a nonparametric testing procedure and demonstrate the benefits of capturing instance-level variability on of synthetic and real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>Conceptualizing Uncertainty: A Concept-based Approach to Explaining Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty in machine learning refers to the degree of confidence or lack thereof in a model's predictions. While uncertainty quantification methods exist, explanations of uncertainty, especially in high-dimensional settings, remain an open challenge. Existing work focuses on feature attribution approaches which are restricted to local explanations. Understanding uncertainty, its origins, and characteristics on a global scale is crucial for enhancing interpretability and trust in a model's predictions. In this work, we propose to explain the uncertainty in high-dimensional data classification settings by means of concept activation vectors which give rise to local and global explanations of uncertainty. We demonstrate the utility of the generated explanations by leveraging them to refine and improve our model.</description>

      <title>SQuat: Subspace-orthogonal KV Cache Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache accelerates LLMs decoding by storing KV tensors from previously generated tokens. It reduces redundant computation at the cost of increased memory usage. To mitigate this overhead, existing approaches compress KV tensors into lower-bit representations; however, quantization errors can accumulate as more tokens are generated, potentially resulting in undesired outputs. In this paper, we introduce SQuat (Subspace-orthogonal KV cache quantization). It first constructs a subspace spanned by query tensors to capture the most critical task-related information. During key tensor quantization, it enforces that the difference between the (de)quantized and original keys remains orthogonal to this subspace, minimizing the impact of quantization errors on the attention mechanism's outputs. SQuat requires no model fine-tuning, no additional calibration dataset for offline learning, and is grounded in a theoretical framework we develop. Through numerical experiments, we show that our method reduces peak memory by 2.17 to 2.82, improves throughput by 2.45 to 3.60, and achieves more favorable benchmark scores than existing KV cache quantization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Compton Form Factor Extraction using Quantum Deep Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extraction of Compton Form Factors (CFFs) from Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) experiments conducted at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, utilizing Quantum Deep Neural Networks (QDNNs). The analysis employs the standard Belitsky, Kirchner, and M\"uller formalism at twist-two, complemented by a fitting procedure designed to minimize model dependence in a manner analogous to conventional local fits. A pseudodata extraction test of the CFFs is performed using both Classical Deep Neural Networks (CDNNs) and QDNNs, with a detailed comparative analysis. Results indicate that QDNNs can outperform CDNNs in particular cases, offering enhanced predictive accuracy and precision even with limited model complexity. Motivated by this, we develop a metric to quantify the extent of the quantum advantage based on characteristics of DVCS experimental data. These findings underscore the promising role of QDNNs in advancing future investigations into multidimensional parton distributions and hadronic physics.</description>

      <title>LLAMAPIE: Proactive In-Ear Conversation Assistants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce LlamaPIE, the first real-time proactive assistant designed to enhance human conversations through discreet, concise guidance delivered via hearable devices. Unlike traditional language models that require explicit user invocation, this assistant operates in the background, anticipating user needs without interrupting conversations. We address several challenges, including determining when to respond, crafting concise responses that enhance conversations, leveraging knowledge of the user for context-aware assistance, and real-time, on-device processing. To achieve this, we construct a semi-synthetic dialogue dataset and propose a two-model pipeline: a small model that decides when to respond and a larger model that generates the response. We evaluate our approach on real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in providing helpful, unobtrusive assistance. User studies with our assistant, implemented on Apple Silicon M2 hardware, show a strong preference for the proactive assistant over both a baseline with no assistance and a reactive model, highlighting the potential of LlamaPie to enhance live conversations.</description>

      <title>An $\tilde{O}$ptimal Differentially Private Learner for Concept Classes with VC Dimension 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first nearly optimal differentially private PAC learner for any concept class with VC dimension 1 and Littlestone dimension $d$. Our algorithm achieves the sample complexity of $\tilde{O}_{\varepsilon,\delta,\alpha,\delta}(\log^* d)$, nearly matching the lower bound of $\Omega(\log^* d)$ proved by Alon et al. [STOC19]. Prior to our work, the best known upper bound is $\tilde{O}(VC\cdot d^5)$ for general VC classes, as shown by Ghazi et al. [STOC21].</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Probabilistic Modeling with LLM for Multimodal Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is important for applications spanning energy markets, climate analysis, and traffic management. However, existing methods struggle to effectively integrate exogenous texts and align them with the probabilistic nature of large language models (LLMs). Current approaches either employ shallow text-time series fusion via basic prompts or rely on deterministic numerical decoding that conflict with LLMs' token-generation paradigm, which limits contextual awareness and distribution modeling. To address these limitations, we propose CAPTime, a context-aware probabilistic multimodal time series forecasting method that leverages text-informed abstraction and autoregressive LLM decoding. Our method first encodes temporal patterns using a pretrained time series encoder, then aligns them with textual contexts via learnable interactions to produce joint multimodal representations. By combining a mixture of distribution experts with frozen LLMs, we enable context-aware probabilistic forecasting while preserving LLMs' inherent distribution modeling capabilities. Experiments on diverse time series forecasting tasks demonstrate the superior accuracy and generalization of CAPTime, particularly in multimodal scenarios. Additional analysis highlights its robustness in data-scarce scenarios through hybrid probabilistic decoding.</description>

      <title>Learning Pareto-Optimal Rewards from Noisy Preferences: A Framework for Multi-Objective Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11864v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As generative agents become increasingly capable, alignment of their behavior with complex human values remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches often simplify human intent through reduction to a scalar reward, overlooking the multi-faceted nature of human feedback. In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework for preference-based Multi-Objective Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MO-IRL), where human preferences are modeled as latent vector-valued reward functions. We formalize the problem of recovering a Pareto-optimal reward representation from noisy preference queries and establish conditions for identifying the underlying multi-objective structure. We derive tight sample complexity bounds for recovering $\epsilon$-approximations of the Pareto front and introduce a regret formulation to quantify suboptimality in this multi-objective setting. Furthermore, we propose a provably convergent algorithm for policy optimization using preference-inferred reward cones. Our results bridge the gap between practical alignment techniques and theoretical guarantees, providing a principled foundation for learning aligned behaviors in a high-dimension and value-pluralistic environment.</description>

      <title>Mining Intrinsic Rewards from LLM Hidden States for Efficient Best-of-N Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhancing Large Language Model (LLM)'s performance with best-of-N sampling is effective and has attracted significant attention. However, it is computationally prohibitive due to massive, data-hungry text-based reward models. By changing the data source from text to hidden states, we introduce SWIFT (Simple Weighted Intrinsic Feedback Technique), a novel, lightweight technique that leverages the rich information embedded in LLM hidden states to address these issues, which operates on token-level and consists of only linear layers. Extensive experiments show that SWIFT outperforms baselines with less than 0.005% of the parameters of baselines, requiring only a few samples for training, demonstrating significant efficiency improvement. SWIFT's robust scalability, applicability to some closed-source models via logits, and ability to be combined with traditional reward models to yield further performance gains underscore its practical value.</description>

      <title>Position: Adopt Constraints Over Penalties in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent efforts to develop trustworthy AI systems with accountability guarantees have led to widespread use of machine learning formulations incorporating external requirements, or constraints. These requirements are often enforced via penalization--adding fixed-weight terms to the task loss. We argue this approach is fundamentally ill-suited since there may be no penalty coefficient that simultaneously ensures constraint satisfaction and optimal constrained performance, i.e., that truly solves the constrained problem. Moreover, tuning these coefficients requires costly trial-and-error, incurring significant time and computational overhead. We, therefore, advocate for broader adoption of tailored constrained optimization methods--such as the Lagrangian approach, which jointly optimizes the penalization "coefficients" (the Lagrange multipliers) and the model parameters. Such methods (i) truly solve the constrained problem and do so accountably, by clearly defining feasibility and verifying when it is achieved, (ii) eliminate the need for extensive penalty tuning, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with modern deep learning pipelines.</description>

Abstract: We consider a bandit optimization problem for nonconvex and non-smooth functions, where in each trial the loss function is the sum of a linear function and a small but arbitrary perturbation chosen after observing the player's choice. We give both expected and high probability regret bounds for the problem. Our result also implies an improved high-probability regret bound for the bandit linear optimization, a special case with no perturbation. We also give a lower bound on the expected regret.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised risk factor identification across cancer types and data modalities via explainable artificial intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Risk stratification is a key tool in clinical decision-making, yet current approaches often fail to translate sophisticated survival analysis into actionable clinical criteria. We present a novel method for unsupervised machine learning that directly optimizes for survival heterogeneity across patient clusters through a differentiable adaptation of the multivariate logrank statistic. Unlike most existing methods that rely on proxy metrics, our approach represents novel methodology for training any neural network architecture on any data modality to identify prognostically distinct patient groups. We thoroughly evaluate the method in simulation experiments and demonstrate its utility in practice by applying it to two distinct cancer types: analyzing laboratory parameters from multiple myeloma patients and computed tomography images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, identifying prognostically distinct patient subgroups with significantly different survival outcomes in both cases. Post-hoc explainability analyses uncover clinically meaningful features determining the group assignments which align well with established risk factors and thus lend strong weight to the methods utility. This pan-cancer, model-agnostic approach represents a valuable advancement in clinical risk stratification, enabling the discovery of novel prognostic signatures across diverse data types while providing interpretable results that promise to complement treatment personalization and clinical decision-making in oncology and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful tools for solving nonlinear problems in science and engineering, but training highly accurate models becomes challenging as problem complexity increases. Non-convex optimization and numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE) while overlooking $L^{\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks, leading to improved overall accuracy. We discuss how to take advantage of the structure of the residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of parameters to use, and ways to introduce adaptive data sampling techniques. We validate our framework's effectiveness through several benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>Automated Generation of Diverse Courses of Actions for Multi-Agent Operations using Binary Optimization and Graph Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Operations in disaster response, search \&amp; rescue, and military missions that involve multiple agents demand automated processes to support the planning of the courses of action (COA). Moreover, traverse-affecting changes in the environment (rain, snow, blockades, etc.) may impact the expected performance of a COA, making it desirable to have a pool of COAs that are diverse in task distributions across agents. Further, variations in agent capabilities, which could be human crews and/or autonomous systems, present practical opportunities and computational challenges to the planning process. This paper presents a new theoretical formulation and computational framework to generate such diverse pools of COAs for operations with soft variations in agent-task compatibility. Key to the problem formulation is a graph abstraction of the task space and the pool of COAs itself to quantify its diversity. Formulating the COAs as a centralized multi-robot task allocation problem, a genetic algorithm is used for (order-ignoring) allocations of tasks to each agent that jointly maximize diversity within the COA pool and overall compatibility of the agent-task mappings. A graph neural network is trained using a policy gradient approach to then perform single agent task sequencing in each COA, which maximizes completion rates adaptive to task features. Our tests of the COA generation process in a simulated environment demonstrate significant performance gain over a random walk baseline, small optimality gap in task sequencing, and execution time of about 50 minutes to plan up to 20 COAs for 5 agent/100 task operations.</description>

Abstract: Satellite remote sensing from repeated observations and multiple sensors enables a wide range of downstream applications, including climate modeling, carbon accounting, and strategies for conservation and sustainable land use. However, satellite time series are voluminous, often corrupted by sensor noise, clouds, and atmospheric conditions, and unevenly spaced in time, making them challenging to use. We present TESSERA, an open, global, land-oriented remote sensing foundation model that uses self-supervised learning to generate `ready-to-use' embeddings at 10~m scale from pixel-level satellite time series data. TESSERA uses two parallel Transformer-based encoders to combine optical data from ten Sentinel-2 spectral bands at 10-60~m spatial resolution and two Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar backscatter coefficients at 10~m resolution to create embeddings that are subsequently fused with a multilayer perceptron to create annual global embedding maps. We compare our work with state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models in five diverse downstream tasks and find that TESSERA closely matches or outperforms these baselines. We believe that TESSERA's ease of use, openness, computation-, label-, and data-efficiency, and high performance will prove transformative in a wide range of vegetation-oriented ecological and agricultural applications.</description>

Abstract: Allocation of personnel and material resources is highly sensible in the case of firefighter interventions. This allocation relies on simulations to experiment with various scenarios. The main objective of this allocation is the global optimization of the firefighters response. Data generation is then mandatory to study various scenarios In this study, we propose to compare different data generation methods. Methods such as Random Sampling, Tabular Variational Autoencoders, standard Generative Adversarial Networks, Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Probabilistic Models are examined to ascertain their efficacy in capturing the intricacies of firefighter interventions. Traditional evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the nuanced requirements of synthetic datasets for real-world scenarios. To address this gap, an evaluation of synthetic data quality is conducted using a combination of domain-specific metrics tailored to the firefighting domain and standard measures such as the Wasserstein distance. Domain-specific metrics include response time distribution, spatial-temporal distribution of interventions, and accidents representation. These metrics are designed to assess data variability, the preservation of fine and complex correlations and anomalies such as event with a very low occurrence, the conformity with the initial statistical distribution and the operational relevance of the synthetic data. The distribution has the particularity of being highly unbalanced, none of the variables following a Gaussian distribution, adding complexity to the data generation process.</description>

      <title>"So, Tell Me About Your Policy...": Distillation of interpretable policies from Deep Reinforcement Learning agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) largely benefit from the inclusion of Deep Neural Networks, boosting the number of novel approaches proposed in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These techniques demonstrate the ability to tackle complex games such as Atari, Go, and other real-world applications, including financial trading. Nevertheless, a significant challenge emerges from the lack of interpretability, particularly when attempting to comprehend the underlying patterns learned, the relative importance of the state features, and how they are integrated to generate the policy's output. For this reason, in mission-critical and real-world settings, it is often preferred to deploy a simpler and more interpretable algorithm, although at the cost of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, supported by theoretical guarantees, that can extract an interpretable policy (e.g., a linear policy) without disregarding the peculiarities of expert behavior. This result is obtained by considering the advantage function, which includes information about why an action is superior to the others. In contrast to previous works, our approach enables the training of an interpretable policy using previously collected experience. The proposed algorithm is empirically evaluated on classic control environments and on a financial trading scenario, demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful information from complex expert policies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential and effective tool for diagnosing heart diseases. However, its effectiveness can be compromised by noise or unavailability of one or more leads of the standard 12-lead recordings, resulting in diagnostic errors or uncertainty. To address these challenges, we propose TolerantECG, a foundation model for ECG signals that is robust to noise and capable of functioning with arbitrary subsets of the standard 12-lead ECG. TolerantECG training combines contrastive and self-supervised learning frameworks to jointly learn ECG signal representations alongside their corresponding knowledge-retrieval-based text report descriptions and corrupted or lead-missing signals. Comprehensive benchmarking results demonstrate that TolerantECG consistently ranks as the best or second-best performer across various ECG signal conditions and class levels in the PTB-XL dataset, and achieves the highest performance on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a paradigm for privacy-preserving collaborative AI, but its decentralized nature creates significant vulnerabilities to model poisoning attacks. While numerous static defenses exist, their effectiveness is highly context-dependent, often failing against adaptive adversaries or in heterogeneous data environments. This paper introduces FedStrategist, a novel meta-learning framework that reframes robust aggregation as a real-time, cost-aware control problem. We design a lightweight contextual bandit agent that dynamically selects the optimal aggregation rule from an arsenal of defenses based on real-time diagnostic metrics. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that no single static rule is universally optimal. We show that our adaptive agent successfully learns superior policies across diverse scenarios, including a ``Krum-favorable" environment and against a sophisticated "stealth" adversary designed to neutralize specific diagnostic signals. Critically, we analyze the paradoxical scenario where a non-robust baseline achieves high but compromised accuracy, and demonstrate that our agent learns a conservative policy to prioritize model integrity. Furthermore, we prove the agent's policy is controllable via a single "risk tolerance" parameter, allowing practitioners to explicitly manage the trade-off between performance and security. Our work provides a new, practical, and analyzable approach to creating resilient and intelligent decentralized AI systems.</description>

      <title>Prediction accuracy versus rescheduling flexibility in elective surgery management</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The availability of downstream resources plays is critical in planning the admission of elective surgery patients. The most crucial one is inpatient beds. To ensure bed availability, hospitals may use machine learning (ML) models to predict patients' length-of-stay (LOS) in the admission planning stage. However, the real value of the LOS for each patient may differ from the predicted one, potentially making the schedule infeasible. To address such infeasibilities, it is possible to implement rescheduling strategies that take advantage of operational flexibility. For example, planners may postpone admission dates, relocate patients to different wards, or even transfer patients who are already admitted among wards. A straightforward assumption is that better LOS predictions can help reduce the impact of rescheduling. However, the training process of ML models that can make such accurate predictions can be very costly. Building on previous work that proposed simulated ML for evaluating data-driven approaches, this paper explores the relationship between LOS prediction accuracy and rescheduling flexibility across various corrective policies. Specifically, we examine the most effective patient rescheduling strategies under LOS prediction errors to prevent bed overflows while optimizing resource utilization</description>

      <title>Diffusion Beats Autoregressive in Data-Constrained Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have long dominated the landscape of large language models, driving progress across a wide range of tasks. Recently, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where training involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce. Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to the standard AR paradigm.

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tunes a Sparse Subnetwork in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a key post-pretraining step for aligning large language models (LLMs) with complex tasks and human preferences. While it is often assumed that RL fine-tuning requires updating most of a model's parameters, we challenge this assumption with a surprising finding: RL fine-tuning consistently modifies only a small subnetwork (typically 5-30% of weights), leaving most parameters unchanged. We call this phenomenon RL-induced parameter update sparsity. It arises naturally, without any sparsity constraints or parameter-efficient tuning, and appears across multiple RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (e.g., OpenAI, Meta, and open-source LLMs). Moreover, the subnetworks updated by RL show substantial overlap across different seeds, datasets, and algorithms-far exceeding chance-suggesting a partially transferable structure in the pretrained model. We show that fine-tuning only this sparse subnetwork recovers full model performance and yields parameters nearly identical to the fully fine-tuned model. Our analysis suggests this sparsity emerges because RL operates near the model's original distribution, requiring only targeted changes. KL penalties, gradient clipping, and on-policy dynamics have limited effect on the sparsity pattern. These findings shed new light on how RL adapts models: not by shifting all weights, but by focusing training on a small, consistently updated subnetwork. This insight enables more efficient RL methods and reframes sparsity through the lens of the lottery ticket hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Risk Intelligence for Green Hydrogen Investment: Insights for Duqm R3 Auction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As green hydrogen emerges as a major component of global decarbonisation, Oman has positioned itself strategically through national auctions and international partnerships. Following two successful green hydrogen project rounds, the country launched its third auction (R3) in the Duqm region. While this area exhibits relative geospatial homogeneity, it is still vulnerable to environmental fluctuations that pose inherent risks to productivity. Despite growing global investment in green hydrogen, operational data remains scarce, with major projects like Saudi Arabia's NEOM facility not expected to commence production until 2026, and Oman's ACME Duqm project scheduled for 2028. This absence of historical maintenance and performance data from large-scale hydrogen facilities in desert environments creates a major knowledge gap for accurate risk assessment for infrastructure planning and auction decisions. Given this data void, environmental conditions emerge as accessible and reliable proxy for predicting infrastructure maintenance pressures, because harsh desert conditions such as dust storms, extreme temperatures, and humidity fluctuations are well-documented drivers of equipment degradation in renewable energy systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Artificial Intelligence decision support system that leverages publicly available meteorological data to develop a predictive Maintenance Pressure Index (MPI), which predicts risk levels and future maintenance demands on hydrogen infrastructure. This tool strengthens regulatory foresight and operational decision-making by enabling temporal benchmarking to assess and validate performance claims over time. It can be used to incorporate temporal risk intelligence into auction evaluation criteria despite the absence of historical operational benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A Scalable and High Availability Solution for Recommending Resolutions to Problem Tickets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resolution of incidents or problem tickets is a common theme in service industries in any sector, including billing and charging systems in telecom domain. Machine learning can help to identify patterns and suggest resolutions for the problem tickets, based on patterns in the historical data of the tickets. However, this process may be complicated due to a variety of phenomena such as data drift and issues such as missing data, lack of data pertaining to resolutions of past incidents, too many similar sounding resolutions due to free text and similar sounding text. This paper proposes a robust ML-driven solution employing clustering, supervised learning, and advanced NLP models to tackle these challenges effectively. Building on previous work, we demonstrate clustering-based resolution identification, supervised classification with LDA, Siamese networks, and One-shot learning, Index embedding. Additionally, we present a real-time dashboard and a highly available Kubernetes-based production deployment. Our experiments with both the open-source Bitext customer-support dataset and proprietary telecom datasets demonstrate high prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Inducing Causal World Models in LLMs for Zero-Shot Physical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advanced linguistic capabilities, fundamentally lack an intuitive understanding of physical dynamics, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios that require causal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce Causal World Model Induction (CWMI), a novel framework designed to embed an explicit model of causal physics within an LLM. Our approach incorporates a dedicated Causal Physics Module (CPM) and a new training objective called Causal Intervention Loss, encouraging the model to learn cause-and-effect relationships from multimodal data. By training the model to predict the outcomes of hypothetical interventions instead of merely capturing statistical correlations, CWMI develops a robust internal representation of physical laws. Experimental results show that CWMI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on zero-shot physical reasoning tasks, including the PIQA benchmark and our newly proposed PhysiCa-Bench dataset. These findings demonstrate that inducing a causal world model is a critical step toward more reliable and generalizable AI systems.</description>

      <title>Active learning for level set estimation under input uncertainty and its extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:1909.06064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Testing under what conditions the product satisfies the desired properties is a fundamental problem in manufacturing industry. If the condition and the property are respectively regarded as the input and the output of a black-box function, this task can be interpreted as the problem called Level Set Estimation (LSE) -- the problem of identifying input regions such that the function value is above (or below) a threshold. Although various methods for LSE problems have been developed so far, there are still many issues to be solved for their practical usage. As one of such issues, we consider the case where the input conditions cannot be controlled precisely, i.e., LSE problems under input uncertainty. We introduce a basic framework for handling input uncertainty in LSE problem, and then propose efficient methods with proper theoretical guarantees. The proposed methods and theories can be generally applied to a variety of challenges related to LSE under input uncertainty such as cost-dependent input uncertainties and unknown input uncertainties. We apply the proposed methods to artificial and real data to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17251v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on social bots aims at advancing knowledge and providing solutions to one of the most debated forms of online manipulation. Yet, social bot research is plagued by widespread biases, hyped results, and misconceptions that set the stage for ambiguities, unrealistic expectations, and seemingly irreconcilable findings. Overcoming such issues is instrumental towards ensuring reliable solutions and reaffirming the validity of the scientific method. Here, we discuss a broad set of consequential methodological and conceptual issues that affect current social bots research, illustrating each with examples drawn from recent studies. More importantly, we demystify common misconceptions, addressing fundamental points on how social bots research is discussed. Our analysis surfaces the need to discuss research about online disinformation and manipulation in a rigorous, unbiased, and responsible way. This article bolsters such effort by identifying and refuting common fallacious arguments used by both proponents and opponents of social bots research, as well as providing directions toward sound methodologies for future research.</description>

      <title>Adversarial attacks and defenses in explainable artificial intelligence: A survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06123v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods are portrayed as a remedy for debugging and trusting statistical and deep learning models, as well as interpreting their predictions. However, recent advances in adversarial machine learning (AdvML) highlight the limitations and vulnerabilities of state-of-the-art explanation methods, putting their security and trustworthiness into question. The possibility of manipulating, fooling or fairwashing evidence of the model's reasoning has detrimental consequences when applied in high-stakes decision-making and knowledge discovery. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of research concerning adversarial attacks on explanations of machine learning models, as well as fairness metrics. We introduce a unified notation and taxonomy of methods facilitating a common ground for researchers and practitioners from the intersecting research fields of AdvML and XAI. We discuss how to defend against attacks and design robust interpretation methods. We contribute a list of existing insecurities in XAI and outline the emerging research directions in adversarial XAI (AdvXAI). Future work should address improving explanation methods and evaluation protocols to take into account the reported safety issues.</description>

      <title>Semantic segmentation of SEM images of lower bainitic and tempered martensitic steels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study employs deep learning techniques to segment scanning electron microscope images, enabling a quantitative analysis of carbide precipitates in lower bainite and tempered martensite steels with comparable strength. Following segmentation, carbides are investigated, and their volume percentage, size distribution, and orientations are probed within the image dataset. Our findings reveal that lower bainite and tempered martensite exhibit comparable volume percentages of carbides, albeit with a more uniform distribution of carbides in tempered martensite. Carbides in lower bainite demonstrate a tendency for better alignment than those in tempered martensite, aligning with the observations of other researchers. However, both microstructures display a scattered carbide orientation, devoid of any discernible pattern. Comparative analysis of aspect ratios and sizes of carbides in lower bainite and tempered martensite unveils striking similarities. The deep learning model achieves an impressive pixelwise accuracy of 98.0% in classifying carbide/iron matrix at the individual pixel level. The semantic segmentation derived from deep learning extends its applicability to the analysis of secondary phases in various materials, offering a time-efficient, versatile AI-powered workflow for quantitative microstructure analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from the domain of image super-resolution, we view the electron density as a 3D grayscale image and use a convolutional residual network to transform a crude and trivially generated guess of the molecular density into an accurate ground-state quantum mechanical density. We find that this model outperforms all prior density prediction approaches. Because the input is itself a real-space density, the predictions are equivariant to molecular symmetry transformations even though the model is not constructed to be. Due to its simplicity, the model is directly applicable to unseen molecular conformations and chemical elements. We show that fine-tuning on limited new data provides high accuracy even in challenging cases of exotic elements and charge states. Our work suggests new routes to learning real-space physical quantities drawing from the established ideas of image processing.</description>

      <title>The pitfalls of next-token prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can a mere next-token predictor faithfully model human intelligence? We crystallize this emerging concern and correct popular misconceptions surrounding it, and advocate a simple multi-token objective.
  As a starting point, we argue that the two often-conflated phases of next-token prediction -- autoregressive inference and teacher-forced training -- must be treated distinctly. The popular criticism that errors can compound during autoregressive inference, crucially assumes that teacher-forcing has learned an accurate next-token predictor. This assumption sidesteps a more deep-rooted problem we expose: in certain classes of tasks, teacher-forcing can simply fail to learn an accurate next-token predictor in the first place. We describe a general mechanism of how teacher-forcing can fail, and design a minimal planning task where both the Transformer and the Mamba architecture empirically fail in that manner -- remarkably, despite the task being straightforward to learn.
  Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that this failure can be resolved using _teacherless_ training, a simple modification using dummy tokens that predicts multiple tokens in advance. We hope this finding can ground future debates and inspire explorations beyond the next-token prediction paradigm. We make our code available under https://github.com/gregorbachmann/Next-Token-Failures</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Directed Distance Fields for Ray-Based Shape Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern computer vision, the optimal representation of 3D shape continues to be task-dependent. One fundamental operation applied to such representations is differentiable rendering, as it enables inverse graphics approaches in learning frameworks. Standard explicit shape representations (voxels, point clouds, or meshes) are often easily rendered, but can suffer from limited geometric fidelity, among other issues. On the other hand, implicit representations (occupancy, distance, or radiance fields) preserve greater fidelity, but suffer from complex or inefficient rendering processes, limiting scalability. In this work, we devise Directed Distance Fields (DDFs), a novel neural shape representation that builds upon classical distance fields. The fundamental operation in a DDF maps an oriented point (position and direction) to surface visibility and depth. This enables efficient differentiable rendering, obtaining depth with a single forward pass per pixel, as well as differential geometric quantity extraction (e.g., surface normals), with only additional backward passes. Using probabilistic DDFs (PDDFs), we show how to model inherent discontinuities in the underlying field. We then apply DDFs to several applications, including single-shape fitting, generative modelling, and single-image 3D reconstruction, showcasing strong performance with simple architectural components via the versatility of our representation. Finally, since the dimensionality of DDFs permits view-dependent geometric artifacts, we conduct a theoretical investigation of the constraints necessary for view consistency. We find a small set of field properties that are sufficient to guarantee a DDF is consistent, without knowing, for instance, which shape the field is expressing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for representing the dynamics of general nonlinear dynamical systems. However, existing data-driven approaches to learning the Koopman operator rely on batch data. In this work, we present a sparse online learning algorithm that learns the Koopman operator iteratively via stochastic approximation, with explicit control over model complexity and provable convergence guarantees. Specifically, we study the Koopman operator via its action on the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and address the mis-specified scenario where the dynamics may escape the chosen RKHS. In this mis-specified setting, we relate the Koopman operator to the conditional mean embeddings (CME) operator. We further establish both asymptotic and finite-time convergence guarantees for our learning algorithm in mis-specified setting, with trajectory-based sampling where the data arrive sequentially over time. Numerical experiments demonstrate the algorithm's capability to learn unknown nonlinear dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has witnessed a remarkable surge in interest, fueled by the empirical success achieved in applications of single-agent reinforcement learning (RL). In this study, we consider a distributed Q-learning scenario, wherein a number of agents cooperatively solve a sequential decision making problem without access to the central reward function which is an average of the local rewards. In particular, we study finite-time analysis of a distributed Q-learning algorithm, and provide a new sample complexity result of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \min\left\{\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}\frac{t_{\text{mix}}}{(1-\gamma)^6 d_{\min}^4 } ,\frac{1}{\epsilon}\frac{\sqrt{|\gS||\gA|}}{(1-\sigma_2(\boldsymbol{W}))(1-\gamma)^4 d_{\min}^3} \right\}\right)$ under tabular lookup</description>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) can solve complex scientific problems beyond human capabilities, but the resulting solutions offer little insight into the underlying physical principles. One prominent example is quantum physics, where computers can discover experiments for the generation of specific quantum states, but it is unclear how finding general design concepts can be automated. Here, we address this challenge by training a transformer-based language model to create human-readable Python code, which solves an entire class of problems in a single pass. This strategy, which we call meta-design, enables scientists to gain a deeper understanding and extrapolate to larger experiments without additional optimization. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we uncover previously unknown experimental generalizations of important quantum states, e.g. from condensed matter physics. The underlying methodology of meta-design can naturally be extended to fields such as materials science or engineering.</description>

      <title>BEACON: A Bayesian Optimization Strategy for Novelty Search in Expensive Black-Box Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03616v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Novelty search (NS) refers to a class of exploration algorithms that seek to uncover diverse system behaviors through simulations or experiments. Such diversity is central to many AI-driven discovery and design tasks, including material and drug development, neural architecture search, and reinforcement learning. However, existing NS methods typically rely on evolutionary strategies and other meta-heuristics that require dense sampling of the input space, making them impractical for expensive black-box systems. In this work, we introduce BEACON, a sample-efficient, Bayesian optimization-inspired approach to NS that is tailored for settings where the input-to-behavior relationship is opaque and costly to evaluate. BEACON models this mapping using multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) and selects new inputs by maximizing a novelty metric computed from posterior samples of the MOGP, effectively balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. By leveraging recent advances in posterior sampling and high-dimensional GP modeling, our method remains scalable to large input spaces and datasets. We evaluate BEACON across ten synthetic benchmarks and eight real-world tasks, including the design of diverse materials for clean energy applications. Our results show that BEACON significantly outperforms existing NS baselines, consistently discovering a broader set of behaviors under tight evaluation budgets.</description>

      <title>Linear Stability Analysis of Physics-Informed Random Projection Neural Networks for ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a linear stability analysis of physics-informed random projection neural networks (PI-RPNNs), for the numerical solution of {the initial value problem (IVP)} of (stiff) ODEs. We begin by proving that PI-RPNNs are uniform approximators of the solution to ODEs. We then provide a constructive proof demonstrating that PI-RPNNs offer consistent and asymptotically stable numerical schemes, thus convergent schemes. In particular, we prove that multi-collocation PI-RPNNs guarantee asymptotic stability. Our theoretical results are illustrated via numerical solutions of benchmark examples including indicative comparisons with the backward Euler method, the midpoint method, the trapezoidal rule, the 2-stage Gauss scheme, and the 2- and 3-stage Radau schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-modal Emotion Recognition (MER) system designed to enhance emotion recognition accuracy in challenging acoustic conditions. Our approach combines a modified and extended Hierarchical Token-semantic Audio Transformer (HTS-AT) for multi-channel audio processing with an R(2+1)D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model for video analysis. We evaluate our proposed method on a reverberated version of the Ryerson audio-visual database of emotional speech and song (RAVDESS) dataset using synthetic and real-world Room Impulse Responsess (RIRs). Our results demonstrate that integrating audio and video modalities yields superior performance compared to uni-modal approaches, especially in challenging acoustic conditions. Moreover, we show that the multimodal (audiovisual) approach that utilizes multiple microphones outperforms its single-microphone counterpart.</description>

      <title>Quantum enhanced stratification of Breast Cancer: exploring quantum expressivity for real omics data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is considered one of the most promising applications of Quantum Computing in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era for the impact it is thought to have in the near future. Although promising theoretical assumptions, the exploration of how QML could foster new discoveries in Medicine and Biology fields is still in its infancy with few examples. In this study, we aimed to assess whether Quantum Kernels (QK) could effectively classify subtypes of Breast Cancer (BC) patients on the basis of molecular characteristics. We performed an heuristic exploration of encoding configurations with different entanglement levels to determine a trade-off between kernel expressivity and performances. Our results show that QKs yield comparable clustering results with classical methods while using fewer data points, and are able to fit the data with a higher number of clusters. Additionally, we conducted the experiments on the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) to evaluate the effect of noise on the outcome. We found that less expressive encodings showed a higher resilience to noise, indicating that the computational pipeline can be reliably implemented on the NISQ devices. Our findings suggest that QK methods show promises for application in Precision Oncology, especially in scenarios where the dataset is limited in size and a granular non-trivial stratification of complex molecular data cannot be achieved classically.</description>

      <title>Collaborative filtering based on nonnegative/binary matrix factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10381v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collaborative filtering generates recommendations by exploiting user-item similarities based on rating data, which often contains numerous unrated items. To predict scores for unrated items, matrix factorization techniques such as nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) are often employed. Nonnegative/binary matrix factorization (NBMF), which is an extension of NMF, approximates a nonnegative matrix as the product of nonnegative and binary matrices. While previous studies have applied NBMF primarily to dense data such as images, this paper proposes a modified NBMF algorithm tailored for collaborative filtering with sparse data. In the modified method, unrated entries in the rating matrix are masked, enhancing prediction accuracy. Furthermore, utilizing a low-latency Ising machine in NBMF is advantageous in terms of the computation time, making the proposed method beneficial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper formalizes Hamiltonian-Informed Optimal Neural (Hion) controllers, a novel class of neural network-based controllers for dynamical systems and explicit non-linear model-predictive control. Hion controllers estimate future states and develop an optimal control strategy using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. The proposed framework, along with our Taylored Multi-Faceted Approach for Neural ODE and Optimal Control (T-mano) architecture, allows for custom transient behavior, predictive control, and closed-loop feedback, addressing limitations of existing methods. Comparative analyses with established model-predictive controllers revealed Hion controllers' superior optimality and tracking capabilities. Optimal control strategies are also demonstrated for both linear and non-linear dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Puzzle Similarity: A Perceptually-guided Cross-Reference Metric for Artifact Detection in 3D Scene Reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern reconstruction techniques can effectively model complex 3D scenes from sparse 2D views. However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of no-reference image metrics in predicting reliable artifact maps. The absence of such metrics hinders assessment of the quality of novel views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. To tackle this, recent work has established a new category of metrics (cross-reference), predicting image quality solely by leveraging context from alternate viewpoint captures (arXiv:2404.14409). In this work, we propose a new cross-reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the training views to establish a scene-specific distribution, later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. Given the lack of good measures to evaluate cross-reference methods in the context of 3D reconstruction, we collected a novel human-labeled dataset of artifact and distortion maps in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art localization of artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, even without aligned references. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

      <title>Robust Matrix Completion for Discrete Rating-Scale Data: Coping with Fake Profiles in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems are essential tools in the digital landscape for connecting users with content that more closely aligns with their preferences. Matrix completion is a widely used statistical framework for such systems, aiming to predict a user's preferences for items they have not yet rated by leveraging the observed ratings in a partially filled user-item rating matrix. Realistic applications of matrix completion in recommender systems must address several challenges that are too often neglected: (i) the discrete nature of rating-scale data, (ii) the presence of malicious users who manipulate the system to their advantage through the creation of fake profiles, and (iii) missing-not-at-random patterns, where users are more likely to rate items they expect to enjoy. Our goal in this paper is twofold. First, we propose a novel matrix completion method, robust discrete matrix completion (RDMC), designed specifically to handle the discrete nature of sparse rating-scale data and to remain reliable in the presence of adversarial manipulation. We evaluate RDMC through carefully designed experiments and realistic case studies. Our work therefore, secondly, offers a statistically-sound blueprint for future studies on how to evaluate matrix completion methods for recommender systems under realistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Back Home: A Computer Vision Solution to Seashell Identification for Ecological Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04873v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Illegal souvenir collection strips an estimated five tonnes of seashells from Costa Rica's beaches each year. Yet, once these specimens are seized, their coastal origin -- Pacific or Caribbean -- cannot be verified easily due to the lack of information, preventing their return when confiscated by local authorities. To solve this issue, we introduce BackHome19K, the first large-scale image corpus (19,058 photographs, 516 species) annotated with coast-level labels, and propose a lightweight pipeline that infers provenance in real time on a mobile-grade CPU. A trained anomaly filter pre-screens uploads, increasing robustness to user-generated noise. On a held-out test set, the classifier attains 86.3% balanced accuracy, while the filter rejects 93% of 180 out-of-domain objects with zero false negatives. Deployed as a web application, the system has already processed 70,000 shells for wildlife officers in under three seconds per image, enabling confiscated specimens to be safely repatriated to their native ecosystems. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/FIFCO/BackHome19K</description>

      <title>Randomized Kaczmarz Methods with Beyond-Krylov Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized Kaczmarz methods form a family of linear system solvers which converge by repeatedly projecting their iterates onto randomly sampled equations. While effective in some contexts, such as highly over-determined least squares, Kaczmarz methods are traditionally deemed secondary to Krylov subspace methods, since this latter family of solvers can exploit outliers in the input's singular value distribution to attain fast convergence on ill-conditioned systems.
  In this paper, we introduce Kaczmarz++, an accelerated randomized block Kaczmarz algorithm that exploits outlying singular values in the input to attain a fast Krylov-style convergence. Moreover, we show that Kaczmarz++ captures large outlying singular values provably faster than popular Krylov methods, for both over- and under-determined systems. We also develop an optimized variant for positive semidefinite systems, called CD++, demonstrating empirically that it is competitive in arithmetic operations with both CG and GMRES on a collection of benchmark problems. To attain these results, we introduce several novel algorithmic improvements to the Kaczmarz framework, including adaptive momentum acceleration, Tikhonov-regularized projections, and a memoization scheme for reusing information from previously sampled equation blocks.</description>

      <title>Ensuring Medical AI Safety: Interpretability-Driven Detection and Mitigation of Spurious Model Behavior and Associated Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly employed in high-stakes medical applications, despite their tendency for shortcut learning in the presence of spurious correlations, which can have potentially fatal consequences in practice. Whereas a multitude of works address either the detection or mitigation of such shortcut behavior in isolation, the Reveal2Revise approach provides a comprehensive bias mitigation framework combining these steps. However, effectively addressing these biases often requires substantial labeling efforts from domain experts. In this work, we review the steps of the Reveal2Revise framework and enhance it with semi-automated interpretability-based bias annotation capabilities. This includes methods for the sample- and feature-level bias annotation, providing valuable information for bias mitigation methods to unlearn the undesired shortcut behavior. We show the applicability of the framework using four medical datasets across two modalities, featuring controlled and real-world spurious correlations caused by data artifacts. We successfully identify and mitigate these biases in VGG16, ResNet50, and contemporary Vision Transformer models, ultimately increasing their robustness and applicability for real-world medical tasks.

      <title>A Review on Self-Supervised Learning for Time Series Anomaly Detection: Recent Advances and Open Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series anomaly detection presents various challenges due to the sequential and dynamic nature of time-dependent data. Traditional unsupervised methods frequently encounter difficulties in generalization, often overfitting to known normal patterns observed during training and struggling to adapt to unseen normality. In response to this limitation, self-supervised techniques for time series have garnered attention as a potential solution to undertake this obstacle and enhance the performance of anomaly detectors. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the recent methods that make use of self-supervised learning for time series anomaly detection. A taxonomy is proposed to categorize these methods based on their primary characteristics, facilitating a clear understanding of their diversity within this field. The information contained in this survey, along with additional details that will be periodically updated, is available on the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/Aitorzan3/Awesome-Self-Supervised-Time-Series-Anomaly-Detection.</description>

      <title>Motion Diffusion Autoencoders: Enabling Attribute Manipulation in Human Motion Demonstrated on Karate Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attribute manipulation deals with the problem of changing individual attributes of a data point or a time series, while leaving all other aspects unaffected. This work focuses on the domain of human motion, more precisely karate movement patterns. To the best of our knowledge, it presents the first success at manipulating attributes of human motion data. One of the key requirements for achieving attribute manipulation on human motion is a suitable pose representation. Therefore, we design a novel continuous, rotation-based pose representation that enables the disentanglement of the human skeleton and the motion trajectory, while still allowing an accurate reconstruction of the original anatomy. The core idea of the manipulation approach is to use a transformer encoder for discovering high-level semantics, and a diffusion probabilistic model for modeling the remaining stochastic variations. We show that the embedding space obtained from the transformer encoder is semantically meaningful and linear. This enables the manipulation of high-level attributes, by discovering their linear direction of change in the semantic embedding space and moving the embedding along said direction. All code and data is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Treatment Effect in Time-to-Event Outcomes: Harnessing Censored Data with Recursively Imputed Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tailoring treatments to individual needs is a central goal in fields such as medicine. A key step toward this goal is estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE) - the way treatments impact different subgroups. While crucial, HTE estimation is challenging with survival data, where time until an event (e.g., death) is key. Existing methods often assume complete observation, an assumption violated in survival data due to right-censoring, leading to bias and inefficiency. Cui et al. (2023) proposed a doubly-robust method for HTE estimation in survival data under no hidden confounders, combining a causal survival forest with an augmented inverse-censoring weighting estimator. However, we find it struggles under heavy censoring, which is common in rare-outcome problems such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moreover, most current methods cannot handle instrumental variables, which are a crucial tool in the causal inference arsenal. We introduce Multiple Imputation for Survival Treatment Response (MISTR), a novel, general, and non-parametric method for estimating HTE in survival data. MISTR uses recursively imputed survival trees to handle censoring without directly modeling the censoring mechanism. Through extensive simulations and analysis of two real-world datasets-the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 175 and the Illinois unemployment dataset we show that MISTR outperforms prior methods under heavy censoring in the no-hidden-confounders setting, and extends to the instrumental variable setting. To our knowledge, MISTR is the first non-parametric approach for HTE estimation with unobserved confounders via instrumental variables.</description>

      <title>Implementing Large Quantum Boltzmann Machines as Generative AI Models for Dataset Balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the implementation of large Quantum Restricted Boltzmann Machines (QRBMs), a key advancement in Quantum Machine Learning (QML), as generative models on D-Wave's Pegasus quantum hardware to address dataset imbalance in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). By leveraging Pegasus's enhanced connectivity and computational capabilities, a QRBM with 120 visible and 120 hidden units was successfully embedded, surpassing the limitations of default embedding tools. The QRBM synthesized over 1.6 million attack samples, achieving a balanced dataset of over 4.2 million records. Comparative evaluations with traditional balancing methods, such as SMOTE and RandomOversampler, revealed that QRBMs produced higher-quality synthetic samples, significantly improving detection rates, precision, recall, and F1 score across diverse classifiers. The study underscores the scalability and efficiency of QRBMs, completing balancing tasks in milliseconds. These findings highlight the transformative potential of QML and QRBMs as next-generation tools in data preprocessing, offering robust solutions for complex computational challenges in modern information systems.</description>

      <title>InfiniteHBD: Building Datacenter-Scale High-Bandwidth Domain for LLM with Optical Circuit Switching Transceivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03885v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling Large Language Model (LLM) training relies on multi-dimensional parallelism, where High-Bandwidth Domains (HBDs) are critical for communication-intensive parallelism like Tensor Parallelism (TP) and Expert Parallelism (EP). However, existing HBD architectures face fundamental limitations in scalability, cost, and fault resiliency: switch-centric HBDs (e.g., NVL-72) incur prohibitive scaling costs, while GPU-centric HBDs (e.g., TPUv3/Dojo) suffer from severe fault propagation. Switch-GPU hybrid HBDs such as TPUv4 take a middle-ground approach, but the fault explosion radius remains large at the cube level (e.g., 64 TPUs).
  We propose InfiniteHBD, a novel transceiver-centric HBD architecture that unifies connectivity and dynamic switching at the transceiver level using Optical Circuit Switching (OCS). By embedding OCS within each transceiver, InfiniteHBD achieves reconfigurable point-to-multipoint connectivity, allowing the topology to adapt to variable-size rings. This design provides: i) datacenter-wide scalability without cost explosion; ii) fault resilience by isolating failures to a single node, and iii) full bandwidth utilization for fault-free GPUs. Key innovations include a Silicon Photonic (SiPh)-based low-cost OCS transceiver (OCSTrx), a reconfigurable k-hop ring topology co-designed with intra-/inter-node communication, and an HBD-DCN orchestration algorithm maximizing GPU utilization while minimizing cross-ToR datacenter network traffic. The evaluation demonstrates that InfiniteHBD achieves 31% of the cost of NVL-72, near-zero GPU waste ratio (over one order of magnitude lower than NVL-72 and TPUv4), near-zero cross-ToR traffic when node fault ratios are under 7%, and improves Model FLOPs Utilization by 3.37x compared to NVIDIA DGX (8 GPUs per Node).</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Barriers and Practical Pathways for Human-AI Alignment: An Agreement-Based Complexity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formalize AI alignment as a multi-objective optimization problem called $\langle M,N,\varepsilon,\delta\rangle$-agreement that generalizes prior approaches with fewer assumptions, in which a set of $N$ agents (including humans) must reach approximate ($\varepsilon$) agreement across $M$ candidate objectives with probability at least $1-\delta$. Using communication complexity, we prove an information-theoretic lower bound demonstrating that once either $M$ or $N$ is large enough, no interaction or rationality can avoid intrinsic alignment overheads. This barrier establishes rigorous intrinsic limits to alignment \emph{itself}, not merely to specific methods, clarifying a crucial ``no free lunch'' principle: encoding ``all human values'' inevitably leads to misalignment, requiring future methods to explicitly manage complexity through consensus-driven reduction or prioritization of objectives. Complementing this impossibility result, we provide explicit algorithms achieving alignment under both computationally unbounded and bounded rationality with noisy messages. Even in these best-case scenarios where alignment to arbitrary precision is theoretically guaranteed, our analysis identifies three critical scalability barriers: the number of tasks ($M$), agents ($N$), and task state space size ($D$); thereby highlighting fundamental complexity-theoretic constraints and providing guidelines for safer, scalable human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>SAKE: Steering Activations for Knowledge Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Langue Models have been shown to memorize real-world facts, the need to update this knowledge in a controlled and efficient manner arises. Designed with these constraints in mind, Knowledge Editing (KE) approaches propose to alter specific facts in pretrained models. However, they have been shown to suffer from several limitations, including their lack of contextual robustness and their failure to generalize to logical implications related to the fact. To overcome these issues, we propose SAKE, a steering activation method that models a fact to be edited as a distribution rather than a single prompt. Leveraging Optimal Transport, SAKE alters the LLM behavior over a whole fact-related distribution, defined as paraphrases and logical implications. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method: SAKE is thus able to perform more robust edits than its existing counterparts.</description>

      <title>($\boldsymbol{\theta}_l, \boldsymbol{\theta}_u$)-Parametric Multi-Task Optimization: Joint Search in Solution and Infinite Task Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-task optimization is typically characterized by a fixed and finite set of tasks. The present paper relaxes this condition by considering a non-fixed and potentially infinite set of optimization tasks defined in a parameterized, continuous and bounded task space. We refer to this unique problem setting as parametric multi-task optimization (PMTO). Assuming the bounds of the task parameters to be ($\boldsymbol{\theta}_l$, $\boldsymbol{\theta}_u$), a novel ($\boldsymbol{\theta}_l$, $\boldsymbol{\theta}_u$)-PMTO algorithm is crafted to operate in two complementary modes. In an offline optimization mode, a joint search over solution and task spaces is carried out with the creation of two approximation models: (1) for mapping points in a unified solution space to the objective spaces of all tasks, which provably accelerates convergence by acting as a conduit for inter-task knowledge transfers, and (2) for probabilistically mapping tasks to their corresponding solutions, which facilitates evolutionary exploration of under-explored regions of the task space. In the online mode, the derived models enable direct optimization of any task within the bounds without the need to search from scratch. This outcome is validated on both synthetic test problems and practical case studies, with the significant real-world applicability of PMTO shown towards fast reconfiguration of robot controllers under changing task conditions. The potential of PMTO to vastly speedup the search for solutions to minimax optimization problems is also demonstrated through an example in robust engineering design.</description>

      <title>InfiniteYou: Flexible Photo Recrafting While Preserving Your Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving flexible and high-fidelity identity-preserved image generation remains formidable, particularly with advanced Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) like FLUX. We introduce InfiniteYou (InfU), one of the earliest robust frameworks leveraging DiTs for this task. InfU addresses significant issues of existing methods, such as insufficient identity similarity, poor text-image alignment, and low generation quality and aesthetics. Central to InfU is InfuseNet, a component that injects identity features into the DiT base model via residual connections, enhancing identity similarity while maintaining generation capabilities. A multi-stage training strategy, including pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with synthetic single-person-multiple-sample (SPMS) data, further improves text-image alignment, ameliorates image quality, and alleviates face copy-pasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfU achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baselines. In addition, the plug-and-play design of InfU ensures compatibility with various existing methods, offering a valuable contribution to the broader community.</description>

      <title>EEG-CLIP : Learning EEG representations from natural language descriptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep networks for electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding are often only trained to solve one specific task, such as pathology or age decoding. A more general task-agnostic approach is to train deep networks to match a (clinical) EEG recording to its corresponding textual medical report and vice versa. This approach was pioneered in the computer vision domain matching images and their text captions and subsequently allowed to do successful zero-shot decoding using textual class prompts. In this work, we follow this approach and develop a contrastive learning framework, EEG-CLIP, that aligns the EEG time series and the descriptions of the corresponding clinical text in a shared embedding space. We investigated its potential for versatile EEG decoding, evaluating performance in a range of few-shot and zero-shot settings. Overall, we show that EEG-CLIP manages to non-trivially align text and EEG representations. Our work presents a promising approach to learn general EEG representations, which could enable easier analyses of diverse decoding questions through zero-shot decoding or training task-specific models from fewer training examples. The code for reproducing our results is available at https://github.com/tidiane-camaret/EEGClip</description>

      <title>Enhancing Glass Defect Detection with Diffusion Models: Addressing Imbalanced Datasets in Manufacturing Quality Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual defect detection in industrial glass manufacturing remains a critical challenge due to the low frequency of defective products, leading to imbalanced datasets that limit the performance of deep learning models and computer vision systems. This paper presents a novel approach using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to generate synthetic defective glass product images for data augmentation, effectively addressing class imbalance issues in manufacturing quality control and automated visual inspection. The methodology significantly enhances image classification performance of standard CNN architectures (ResNet50V2, EfficientNetB0, and MobileNetV2) in detecting anomalies by increasing the minority class representation. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in key machine learning metrics, particularly in recall for defective samples across all tested deep neural network architectures while maintaining perfect precision on the validation set. The most dramatic improvement was observed in ResNet50V2's overall classification accuracy, which increased from 78\% to 93\% when trained with the augmented data. This work provides a scalable, cost-effective approach to enhancing automated defect detection in glass manufacturing that can potentially be extended to other industrial quality assurance systems and industries with similar class imbalance challenges.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing Reasoning for Advanced Instruction-Following of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01413v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose RAIF, a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM. Evaluation on OOD constraints also confirms the generalizability of our RAIF. Codes and data are available at https://github.com/yuleiqin/RAIF.

      <description>arXiv:2506.05413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SmoothRot, a novel post-training quantization technique to enhance the efficiency of 4-bit quantization in Large Language Models (LLMs). SmoothRot addresses the critical challenge of massive activation outliers, by integrating channel-wise scaling with Hadamard transformations. Our technique effectively transforms extreme outliers into quantization-friendly activations, significantly improving quantization accuracy. Experiments conducted on popular LLMs (LLaMA2 7B, LLaMA3.1 8B, and Mistral 7B) demonstrate that SmoothRot consistently reduces the performance gap between quantized and FP16 models by approximately 10-30\% across language generation and zero-shot reasoning tasks, without introducing additional inference latency.

      <title>Fine-Grained Perturbation Guidance via Attention Head Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10978v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality. Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives, enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1, demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of effective perturbation strategies.</description>

      <title>SLR: Automated Synthesis for Scalable Logical Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given a user's task specification, SLR automatically synthesizes (i) an instruction prompt for an inductive reasoning task, (ii) a validation program, executable on model outputs to provide verifiable rewards, and (iii) the latent ground-truth rule. This process is fully automated, scalable, requires no human annotations, and offers precise control over task difficulty. Using SLR, we create SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising 19k prompts organized into 20 curriculum levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference. Recent reasoning LLMs demonstrate improved performance but incur very high test-time computation, with costs exceeding $300 for just 1,000 prompts. Finally, curriculum learning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. Moreover, these reasoning capabilities generalize to a wide range of established benchmarks, underscoring the effectiveness of SLR for downstream reasoning.</description>

      <title>PEVLM: Parallel Encoding for Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in multimodal understanding and generation tasks. However, their application to long video understanding remains hindered by the quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms. In this work, we introduce \textbf{PEVLM}, a fine-tuning-free parallel encoding method designed to enhance the prefilling efficiency of VLMs in long video scenarios. PEVLM partitions the input video into context blocks with a shared sink block, while preserving sequential position embeddings to align the attention weight distribution with that of Full-Attention. This design reduces attention complexity from $O((T \times N)^2)$ to $O(T \times N)$ where $T$ is the number of frames and $N$ the number of tokens per frame, without sacrificing accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple state-of-the-art models and benchmarks demonstrate that PEVLM consistently outperforms existing parallel encoding approaches, achieving up to \textbf{7.47x} speedup in attention computation and reducing end-to-end latency by \textbf{40\%}. Remarkably, PEVLM not only maintains high accuracy, but in some settings even surpasses Full-Attention performance. Under strict latency constraints, it achieves substantial gains, improving accuracy from \textbf{23.26\%} to \textbf{61.03\%}. These results underscore the effectiveness of PEVLM for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it a promising solution for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Extracting Interpretable Models from Tree Ensembles: Computational and Statistical Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tree ensembles are non-parametric methods widely recognized for their accuracy and ability to capture complex interactions. While these models excel at prediction, they are difficult to interpret and may fail to uncover useful relationships in the data. We propose an estimator to extract compact sets of decision rules from tree ensembles. The extracted models are accurate and can be manually examined to reveal relationships between the predictors and the response. A key novelty of our estimator is the flexibility to jointly control the number of rules extracted and the interaction depth of each rule, which improves accuracy. We develop a tailored exact algorithm to efficiently solve optimization problems underlying our estimator and an approximate algorithm for computing regularization paths, sequences of solutions that correspond to varying model sizes. We also establish novel non-asymptotic prediction error bounds for our proposed approach, comparing it to an oracle that chooses the best data-dependent linear combination of the rules in the ensemble subject to the same complexity constraint as our estimator. The bounds illustrate that the large-sample predictive performance of our estimator is on par with that of the oracle. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our estimator outperforms existing algorithms for rule extraction.</description>

      <title>A Detailed Factor Analysis for the Political Compass Test: Navigating Ideologies of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Political Compass Test (PCT) or similar questionnaires have been used to quantify LLM's political leanings. Building on a recent line of work that examines the validity of PCT tests, we demonstrate that variation in standard generation parameters does not significantly impact the models' PCT scores. However, external factors such as prompt variations and fine-tuning individually and in combination affect the same. Finally, we demonstrate that when models are fine-tuned on text datasets with higher political content than others, the PCT scores are not differentially affected. This calls for a thorough investigation into the validity of PCT and similar tests, as well as the mechanism by which political leanings are encoded in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Testing the spin-bath view of self-attention: A Hamiltonian analysis of GPT-2 Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00683v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently proposed physics-based framework by Huo and Johnson~\cite{huo2024capturing} models the attention mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an interacting two-body spin system, offering a first-principles explanation for phenomena like repetition and bias. Building on this hypothesis, we extract the complete Query-Key weight matrices from a production-grade GPT-2 model and derive the corresponding effective Hamiltonian for every attention head. From these Hamiltonians, we obtain analytic phase boundaries and logit gap criteria that predict which token should dominate the next-token distribution for a given context. A systematic evaluation on 144 heads across 20 factual-recall prompts reveals a strong negative correlation between the theoretical logit gaps and the model's empirical token rankings ($r\approx-0.70$, $p&lt;10^{-3}$).Targeted ablations further show that suppressing the heads most aligned with the spin-bath predictions induces the anticipated shifts in output probabilities, confirming a causal link rather than a coincidental association. Taken together, our findings provide the first strong empirical evidence for the spin-bath analogy in a production-grade model. In this work, we utilize the context-field lens, which provides physics-grounded interpretability and motivates the development of novel generative models bridging theoretical condensed matter physics and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Posture-Driven Action Intent Inference for Playing style and Fatigue Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Posture-based mental state inference has significant potential in diagnosing fatigue, preventing injury, and enhancing performance across various domains. Such tools must be research-validated with large datasets before being translated into practice. Unfortunately, such vision diagnosis faces serious challenges due to the sensitivity of human subject data. To address this, we identify sports settings as a viable alternative for accumulating data from human subjects experiencing diverse emotional states. We test our hypothesis in the game of cricket and present a posture-based solution to identify human intent from activity videos. Our method achieves over 75\% F1 score and over 80\% AUC-ROC in discriminating aggressive and defensive shot intent through motion analysis. These findings indicate that posture leaks out strong signals for intent inference, even with inherent noise in the data pipeline. Furthermore, we utilize existing data statistics as weak supervision to validate our findings, offering a potential solution for overcoming data labelling limitations. This research contributes to generalizable techniques for sports analytics and also opens possibilities for applying human behavior analysis across various fields.</description>

      <title>Kodezi Chronos: A Debugging-First Language Model for Repository-Scale Code Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved code generation and software automation, but remain limited by inference-time context and lack structured reasoning over code. Debugging remains unsolved despite these advances. While Claude Opus 4 and GPT-4.1 achieve &gt;70% on code synthesis benchmarks, they perform &lt;15% on real debugging tasks. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a language model built specifically for debugging. Chronos combines Adaptive Graph-Guided Retrieval to navigate codebases up to 10 million lines using multi-hop traversal (92% precision, 85% recall), Persistent Debug Memory trained on 15M+ sessions, and a 7-layer architecture for iterative fix-test-refine loops. On 5,000 real-world scenarios, Chronos achieves 67.3% fix accuracy, compared to 14.2% and 13.8% for Claude and GPT-4.1 respectively. Chronos reduces debugging time by 40% and iteration count by 65%. It resolves complex multi-file bugs involving cross-repository context and temporal reasoning. Key limitations include 23.4% success on hardware-dependent issues and 41.2% on dynamic language errors. Theoretical analysis shows O(k log d) retrieval complexity with convergence guarantees. In a human evaluation (N=50), 89% of participants preferred Chronos over baseline models. Chronos will be available in Kodezi OS in Q4 2025 and via API in Q1 2026.</description>

      <title>AI-ming backwards: Vanishing archaeological landscapes in Mesopotamia and automatic detection of sites on CORONA imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By upgrading an existing deep learning model with the knowledge provided by one of the oldest sets of grayscale satellite imagery, known as CORONA, we improved the AI model attitude towards the automatic identification of archaeological sites in an environment which has been completely transformed in the last five decades, including the complete destruction of many of those same sites. The initial Bing based convolutional network model was retrained using CORONA satellite imagery for the district of Abu Ghraib, west of Baghdad, central Mesopotamian floodplain. The results were twofold and surprising. First, the detection precision obtained on the area of interest increased sensibly: in particular, the Intersection over Union (IoU) values, at the image segmentation level, surpassed 85 percent, while the general accuracy in detecting archeological sites reached 90 percent. Second, our retrained model allowed the identification of four new sites of archaeological interest (confirmed through field verification), previously not identified by archaeologists with traditional techniques. This has confirmed the efficacy of using AI techniques and the CORONA imagery from the 1960 to discover archaeological sites currently no longer visible, a concrete breakthrough with significant consequences for the study of landscapes with vanishing archaeological evidence induced by anthropization</description>

      <title>Quantum Boltzmann Machines using Parallel Annealing for Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploiting the fact that samples drawn from a quantum annealer inherently follow a Boltzmann-like distribution, annealing-based Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) have gained increasing popularity in the quantum research community. While they harbor great promises for quantum speed-up, their usage currently stays a costly endeavor, as large amounts of QPU time are required to train them. This limits their applicability in the NISQ era. Following the idea of No\`e et al. (2024), who tried to alleviate this cost by incorporating parallel quantum annealing into their unsupervised training of QBMs, this paper presents an improved version of parallel quantum annealing that we employ to train QBMs in a supervised setting. Saving qubits to encode the inputs, the latter setting allows us to test our approach on medical images from the MedMNIST data set (Yang et al., 2023), thereby moving closer to real-world applicability of the technology. Our experiments show that QBMs using our approach already achieve reasonable results, comparable to those of similarly-sized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with markedly smaller numbers of epochs than these classical models. Our parallel annealing technique leads to a speed-up of almost 70 % compared to regular annealing-based BM executions.</description>

      <title>C2-Evo: Co-Evolving Multimodal Data and Model for Self-Improving Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities. However, further enhancing existing MLLMs necessitates high-quality vision-language datasets with carefully curated task complexities, which are both costly and challenging to scale. Although recent self-improving models that iteratively refine themselves offer a feasible solution, they still suffer from two core challenges: (i) most existing methods augment visual or textual data separately, resulting in discrepancies in data complexity (e.g., over-simplified diagrams paired with redundant textual descriptions); and (ii) the evolution of data and models is also separated, leading to scenarios where models are exposed to tasks with mismatched difficulty levels. To address these issues, we propose C2-Evo, an automatic, closed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data and model capabilities. Specifically, given a base dataset and a base model, C2-Evo enhances them by a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model evolution loop. The former loop expands the base dataset by generating complex multimodal problems that combine structured textual sub-problems with iteratively specified geometric diagrams, while the latter loop adaptively selects the generated problems based on the performance of the base model, to conduct supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately. Consequently, our method continuously refines its model and training data, and consistently obtains considerable performance gains across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our code, models, and datasets will be released.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based multimodal prognostic models integrating pathology images and high-throughput omic data for overall survival prediction in cancer: a systematic review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal machine learning integrating histopathology and molecular data shows promise for cancer prognostication. We systematically reviewed studies combining whole slide images (WSIs) and high-throughput omics to predict overall survival. Searches of EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane CENTRAL (12/08/2024), plus citation screening, identified eligible studies. Data extraction used CHARMS; bias was assessed with PROBAST+AI; synthesis followed SWiM and PRISMA 2020. Protocol: PROSPERO (CRD42024594745).
  Forty-eight studies (all since 2017) across 19 cancer types met criteria; all used The Cancer Genome Atlas. Approaches included regularised Cox regression (n=4), classical ML (n=13), and deep learning (n=31). Reported c-indices ranged 0.550-0.857; multimodal models typically outperformed unimodal ones. However, all studies showed unclear/high bias, limited external validation, and little focus on clinical utility.
  Multimodal WSI-omics survival prediction is a fast-growing field with promising results but needs improved methodological rigor, broader datasets, and clinical evaluation.

      <title>Addressing High Class Imbalance in Multi-Class Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Grading with Augmentation and Transfer Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, and early diagnosis through automated retinal image analysis can significantly reduce the risk of blindness. This paper presents a robust deep learning framework for both binary and five-class DR classification, leveraging transfer learning and extensive data augmentation to address the challenges of class imbalance and limited training data. We evaluate a range of pretrained convolutional neural network architectures, including variants of ResNet and EfficientNet, on the APTOS 2019 dataset.
  For binary classification, our proposed model achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.9%, with a precision of 98.6%, recall of 99.3%, F1-score of 98.9%, and an AUC of 99.4%. In the more challenging five-class severity classification task, our model obtains a competitive accuracy of 84.6% and an AUC of 94.1%, outperforming several existing approaches. Our findings also demonstrate that EfficientNet-B0 and ResNet34 offer optimal trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency across both tasks.
  These results underscore the effectiveness of combining class-balanced augmentation with transfer learning for high-performance DR diagnosis. The proposed framework provides a scalable and accurate solution for DR screening, with potential for deployment in real-world clinical environments.</description>

      <title>VLA-Touch: Enhancing Vision-Language-Action Models with Dual-Level Tactile Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tactile feedback is generally recognized to be crucial for effective interaction with the physical world. However, state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to interpret and use tactile signals, limiting their effectiveness in contact-rich tasks. Incorporating tactile feedback into these systems is challenging due to the absence of large multi-modal datasets. We present VLA-Touch, an approach that enhances generalist robot policies with tactile sensing \emph{without fine-tuning} the base VLA. Our method introduces two key innovations: (1) a pipeline that leverages a pretrained tactile-language model that provides semantic tactile feedback for high-level task planning, and (2) a diffusion-based controller that refines VLA-generated actions with tactile signals for contact-rich manipulation. Through real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our dual-level integration of tactile feedback improves task planning efficiency while enhancing execution precision.

      <title>Towards Facilitated Fairness Assessment of AI-based Skin Lesion Classifiers Through GenAI-based Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning and its application on the edge hold great potential for the revolution of routine screenings for skin cancers like Melanoma. Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age, and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge, this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images. Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI systems.</description>

      <title>Nonconvex Optimization Framework for Group-Sparse Feedback Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control. I: Penalty Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified nonconvex optimization framework for the design of group-sparse feedback controllers in infinite-horizon linear-quadratic (LQ) problems. We address two prominent extensions of the classical LQ problem: the distributed LQ problem with fixed communication topology (DFT-LQ) and the sparse feedback LQ problem (SF-LQ), both of which are motivated by the need for scalable and structure-aware control in large-scale systems. Unlike existing approaches that rely on convex relaxations or are limited to block-diagonal structures, we directly formulate the controller synthesis as a finite-dimensional nonconvex optimization problem with group $\ell_0$-norm regularization, capturing general sparsity patterns. We establish a connection between DFT-LQ and SF-LQ problems, showing that both can be addressed within our unified framework. Furthermore, we propose a penalty-based proximal alternating linearized minimization (PALM) algorithm and provide a rigorous convergence analysis under mild assumptions, overcoming the lack of coercivity in the objective function. The proposed method admits efficient solvers for all subproblems and guarantees global convergence to critical points. Our results fill a key gap in the literature by enabling the direct design of group-sparse feedback gains with theoretical guarantees, without resorting to convex surrogates or restrictive structural assumptions.</description>

Abstract: Visualizing multiple time series presents fundamental tradeoffs between scalability and visual clarity. Time series capture the behavior of many large-scale real-world processes, from stock market trends to urban activities. Users often gain insights by visualizing them as line charts, juxtaposing or superposing multiple time series to compare them and identify trends and patterns. However, existing representations struggle with scalability: when covering long time spans, leading to visual clutter from too many small multiples or overlapping lines. We propose TiVy, a new algorithm that summarizes time series using sequential patterns. It transforms the series into a set of symbolic sequences based on subsequence visual similarity using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), then constructs a disjoint grouping of similar subsequences based on the frequent sequential patterns. The grouping result, a visual summary of time series, provides uncluttered superposition with fewer small multiples. Unlike common clustering techniques, TiVy extracts similar subsequences (of varying lengths) aligned in time. We also present an interactive time series visualization that renders large-scale time series in real-time. Our experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm (1) extracts clear and accurate patterns when visualizing time series data, (2) achieves a significant speed-up (1000X) compared to a straightforward DTW clustering. We also demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to explore hidden structures in massive time series data in two usage scenarios.</description>

      <title>Sem-DPO: Mitigating Semantic Inconsistency in Preference Optimization for Prompt Engineering</title>

Abstract: Generative AI can now synthesize strikingly realistic images from text, yet output quality remains highly sensitive to how prompts are phrased. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offers a lightweight, off-policy alternative to RL for automatic prompt engineering, but its token-level regularization leaves semantic inconsistency unchecked as prompts that win higher preference scores can still drift away from the user's intended meaning.
  We introduce Sem-DPO, a variant of DPO that preserves semantic consistency yet retains its simplicity and efficiency. Sem-DPO adjusts the DPO loss using a weight based on how different the winning prompt is from the original, reducing the impact of training examples that are semantically misaligned. We provide the first analytical bound on semantic drift for preference-tuned prompt generators, showing that Sem-DPO keeps learned prompts within a provably bounded neighborhood of the original text. On three standard text-to-image prompt-optimization benchmarks and two language models, Sem-DPO achieves 8-12% higher CLIP similarity and 5-9% higher human-preference scores (HPSv2.1, PickScore) than DPO, while also outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These findings suggest that strong flat baselines augmented with semantic weighting should become the new standard for prompt-optimization studies and lay the groundwork for broader, semantics-aware preference optimization in language models.</description>
