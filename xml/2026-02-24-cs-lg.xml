      <title>Reducing Text Bias in Synthetically Generated MCQAs for VLMs in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) benchmarks are an established standard for measuring Vision Language Model (VLM) performance in driving tasks. However, we observe the known phenomenon that synthetically generated MCQAs are highly susceptible to hidden textual cues that allow models to exploit linguistic patterns rather than visual context. Our results show that a VLM fine-tuned on such data can achieve accuracy comparable to human-validated benchmarks even without visual input. Our proposed method reduces blind accuracy from +66.9% above random to +2.9%, eliminating the vast majority of exploitable textual shortcuts. By decoupling the correct answer from linguistic artifacts and employing a curriculum learning strategy, we force the model to rely on visual grounding, ensuring that performance accurately reflects perceptual understanding.</description>

      <title>Joint Parameter and State-Space Bayesian Optimization: Using Process Expertise to Accelerate Manufacturing Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful method for optimizing black-box manufacturing processes, but its performance is often limited when dealing with high-dimensional multi-stage systems, where we can observe intermediate outputs. Standard BO models the process as a black box and ignores the intermediate observations and the underlying process structure. Partially Observable Gaussian Process Networks (POGPN) model the process as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). However, using intermediate observations is challenging when the observations are high-dimensional state-space time series. Process-expert knowledge can be used to extract low-dimensional latent features from the high-dimensional state-space data. We propose POGPN-JPSS, a framework that combines POGPN with Joint Parameter and State-Space (JPSS) modeling to use intermediate extracted information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of POGPN-JPSS on a challenging, high-dimensional simulation of a multi-stage bioethanol production process. Our results show that POGPN-JPSS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving the desired performance threshold twice as fast and with greater reliability. The fast optimization directly translates to substantial savings in time and resources. This highlights the importance of combining expert knowledge with structured probabilistic models for rapid process maturation.</description>

      <title>BioBridge: Bridging Proteins and Language for Enhanced Biological Reasoning with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Protein Language Models (PLMs) often suffer from limited adaptability to multiple tasks and exhibit poor generalization across diverse biological contexts. In contrast, general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) lack the capability to interpret protein sequences and fall short in domain-specific knowledge, limiting their capacity for effective biosemantic reasoning. To combine the advantages of both, we propose BioBridge, a domain-adaptive continual pretraining framework for protein understanding. This framework employs Domain-Incremental Continual Pre-training (DICP) to infuse protein domain knowledge and general reasoning corpus into a LLM simultaneously, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Cross-modal alignment is achieved via a PLM-Projector-LLM pipeline, which maps protein sequence embeddings into the semantic space of the language model. Ultimately, an end-to-end optimization is adopted to uniformly support various tasks, including protein property prediction and knowledge question-answering. Our proposed BioBridge demonstrates performance comparable to that of mainstream PLMs on multiple protein benchmarks, such as EC and BindingDB. It also achieves results on par with LLMs on general understanding tasks like MMLU and RACE. This showcases its innovative advantage of combining domain-specific adaptability with general-purpose language competency.</description>

      <title>LATMiX: Learnable Affine Transformations for Microscaling Quantization of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a widely used approach for reducing the memory and compute costs of large language models (LLMs). Recent studies have shown that applying invertible transformations to activations can significantly improve quantization robustness by reducing activation outliers; however, existing approaches are largely restricted to rotation or Hadamard-based transformations. Moreover, most studies focused primarily on traditional quantization schemes, whereas modern hardware increasingly supports the microscaling (MX) data format. Attempts to combine both showed severe performance degradation, leading prior work to introduce assumptions on the transformations. In this work, we take a complementary perspective. First, we provide a theoretical analysis of transformations under MX quantization by deriving a bound on the quantization error. Our analysis emphasizes the importance of accounting for both the activation distribution and the underlying quantization structure. Building on this analysis, we propose LATMiX, a method that generalizes outlier reduction to learnable invertible affine transformations optimized using standard deep learning tools. Experiments show consistent improvements in average accuracy for MX low-bit quantization over strong baselines on a wide range of zero-shot benchmarks, across multiple model sizes.</description>

      <title>Duality Models: An Embarrassingly Simple One-step Generation Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consistency-based generative models like Shortcut and MeanFlow achieve impressive results via a target-aware design for solving the Probability Flow ODE (PF-ODE). Typically, such methods introduce a target time $r$ alongside the current time $t$ to modulate outputs between a local multi-step derivative ($r = t$) and a global few-step integral ($r = 0$). However, the conventional "one input, one output" paradigm enforces a partition of the training budget, often allocating a significant portion (e.g., 75% in MeanFlow) solely to the multi-step objective for stability. This separation forces a trade-off: allocating sufficient samples to the multi-step objective leaves the few-step generation undertrained, which harms convergence and limits scalability. To this end, we propose Duality Models (DuMo) via a "one input, dual output" paradigm. Using a shared backbone with dual heads, DuMo simultaneously predicts velocity $v_t$ and flow-map $u_t$ from a single input $x_t$. This applies geometric constraints from the multi-step objective to every sample, bounding the few-step estimation without separating training objectives, thereby significantly improving stability and efficiency. On ImageNet 256 $\times$ 256, a 679M Diffusion Transformer with SD-VAE achieves a state-of-the-art (SOTA) FID of 1.79 in just 2 steps.

      <title>Probabilistic NDVI Forecasting from Sparse Satellite Time Series and Weather Covariates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate short-term forecasting of vegetation dynamics is a key enabler for data-driven decision support in precision agriculture. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) forecasting from satellite observations, however, remains challenging due to sparse and irregular sampling caused by cloud coverage, as well as the heterogeneous climatic conditions under which crops evolve. In this work, we propose a probabilistic forecasting framework specifically designed for field-level NDVI prediction under clear-sky acquisition constraints. The method leverages a transformer-based architecture that explicitly separates the modeling of historical vegetation dynamics from future exogenous information, integrating historical NDVI observations with both historical and future meteorological covariates. To address irregular revisit patterns and horizon-dependent uncertainty, we introduce a temporal-distance weighted quantile loss that aligns the training objective with the effective forecasting horizon. In addition, we incorporate cumulative and extreme-weather feature engineering to better capture delayed meteorological effects relevant to vegetation response. Extensive experiments on European satellite data demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms a diverse set of statistical, deep learning, and recent time series baselines across both point-wise and probabilistic evaluation metrics. Ablation studies further highlight the central role of target history, while showing that meteorological covariates provide complementary gains when jointly exploited. The code is available at https://github.com/arco-group/ndvi-forecasting.</description>

      <title>CodeScaler: Scaling Code LLM Training and Test-Time Inference via Execution-Free Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has driven recent progress in code large language models by leveraging execution-based feedback from unit tests, but its scalability is fundamentally constrained by the availability and reliability of high-quality test cases. We propose CodeScaler, an execution-free reward model designed to scale both reinforcement learning training and test-time inference for code generation. CodeScaler is trained on carefully curated preference data derived from verified code problems and incorporates syntax-aware code extraction and validity-preserving reward shaping to ensure stable and robust optimization. Across five coding benchmarks, CodeScaler improves Qwen3-8B-Base by an average of +11.72 points, outperforming binary execution-based RL by +1.82 points, and enables scalable reinforcement learning on synthetic datasets without any test cases. At inference time, CodeScaler serves as an effective test-time scaling method, achieving performance comparable to unit test approaches while providing a 10-fold reduction in latency. Moreover, CodeScaler surpasses existing reward models on RM-Bench not only in the code domain (+3.3 points), but also in general and reasoning domains (+2.7 points on average).</description>

      <title>Optimal Multi-Debris Mission Planning in LEO: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach with Co-Elliptic Transfers and Refueling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of multi target active debris removal (ADR) in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) by introducing a unified coelliptic maneuver framework that combines Hohmann transfers, safety ellipse proximity operations, and explicit refueling logic. We benchmark three distinct planning algorithms Greedy heuristic, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and deep reinforcement learning (RL) using Masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) within a realistic orbital simulation environment featuring randomized debris fields, keep out zones, and delta V constraints. Experimental results over 100 test scenarios demonstrate that Masked PPO achieves superior mission efficiency and computational performance, visiting up to twice as many debris as Greedy and significantly outperforming MCTS in runtime. These findings underscore the promise of modern RL methods for scalable, safe, and resource efficient space mission planning, paving the way for future advancements in ADR autonomy.</description>

      <title>Curriculum Learning for Efficient Chain-of-Thought Distillation via Structure-Aware Masking and GRPO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distilling Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning from large language models into compact student models presents a fundamental challenge: teacher rationales are often too verbose for smaller models to faithfully reproduce. Existing approaches either compress reasoning into single-step, losing the interpretability that makes CoT valuable. We present a three-stage curriculum learning framework that addresses this capacity mismatch through progressive skill acquisition. First, we establish structural understanding via masked shuffled reconstruction. Second, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on masked completion tasks, enabling the model to discover its own balance between accuracy and brevity. Third, we identify persistent failure cases and guide the student to internalize teacher knowledge through targeted rewriting, again optimized with GRPO. Experiments on GSM8K demonstrate that our approach enables Qwen2.5-3B-Base to achieve an 11.29 percent accuracy improvement while reducing output length by 27.4 percent, surpassing both instruction-tuned variants and prior distillation methods.</description>

      <title>AnCoder: Anchored Code Generation via Discrete Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion language models offer a compelling alternative to autoregressive code generation, enabling global planning and iterative refinement of complex program logic. However, existing approaches fail to respect the rigid structure of programming languages and, as a result, often produce broken programs that fail to execute. To address this, we introduce AnchorTree, a framework that explicitly anchors the diffusion process using structured, hierarchical priors native to code. Specifically, AnchorTree uses the abstract syntax tree to prioritize resolving syntactically and semantically salient tokens, such as keywords (e.g., if, while) and identifiers (e.g., variable names), thereby establishing a structural scaffold that guides the remaining generation. We validate this framework via AnCoder, a family of models showing that structurally anchored diffusion offers a parameter-efficient path to high-quality code generation.</description>

      <title>Robust Pre-Training of Medical Vision-and-Language Models with Domain-Invariant Multi-Modal Masked Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical vision-language models show strong potential for joint reasoning over medical images and clinical text, but their performance often degrades under domain shift caused by variations in imaging devices, acquisition protocols, and reporting styles. Existing multi-modal pre-training methods largely overlook robustness, treating it as a downstream adaptation problem. In this work, we propose Robust Multi-Modal Masked Reconstruction (Robust-MMR), a self-supervised pre-training framework that explicitly incorporates robustness objectives into masked vision-language learning. Robust-MMR integrates asymmetric perturbation-aware masking, domain-consistency regularization, and modality-resilience constraints to encourage domain-invariant representations. We evaluate Robust-MMR on multiple medical vision-language benchmarks, including medical visual question answering (VQA-RAD, SLAKE, VQA-2019), cross-domain image-text classification (MELINDA), and robust image-caption retrieval (ROCO). Robust-MMR achieves 78.9% cross-domain accuracy on VQA-RAD, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.8 percentage points, and reaches 74.6% and 77.0% accuracy on SLAKE and VQA-2019, respectively. Under perturbed evaluation, Robust-MMR improves VQA-RAD accuracy from 69.1% to 75.6%. For image-text classification, cross-domain MELINDA accuracy increases from 70.3% to 75.2%, while retrieval experiments show a reduction in mean rank degradation from over 16 to 4.1 under perturbation. Qualitative results further demonstrate improved clinical reasoning for disease detection and structural abnormality assessment. These findings show that explicitly modeling robustness during pre-training leads to more reliable and transferable medical vision-language representations for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Tethered Reasoning: Decoupling Entropy from Hallucination in Quantized LLMs via Manifold Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantized language models face a fundamental dilemma: low sampling temperatures yield repetitive, mode-collapsed outputs, while high temperatures (T &gt; 2.0) cause trajectory divergence and semantic incoherence. We present HELIX, a geometric framework that decouples output entropy from hallucination by tethering hidden-state trajectories to a pre-computed truthfulness manifold. HELIX computes a Unified Truth Score (UTS) combining token-level semantic entropy with Mahalanobis distance from the manifold. When UTS indicates trajectory divergence, graduated steering vectors redirect activations toward structurally coherent regions while affecting only 0.2-2.5% of tokens.
  On 4-bit quantized Granite 4.0 H Small (32B/9B active, hybrid Mamba-Transformer): GSM8K maintains 88.84% accuracy at T = 3.0 (2.81pp degradation from T = 0.5); MMLU maintains 72.49% across 14,042 questions (1.24pp degradation). This demonstrates that high-temperature hallucination is primarily trajectory divergence rather than semantic collapse. Notably, steering the sparse Transformer attention layers (~10% of layers) is sufficient to correct drift in the Mamba-2 state-space formulation.
  Geometric tethering reveals a previously-masked High-Entropy Creative Reservoir. At T &gt; 2.0, steered outputs exhibit 5-20% idea duplication versus 70-80% at conservative settings. Cross-architecture validation (Qwen3-30B-A3B MOE) confirms this phenomenon is architecture-independent, with 46.7% higher unique concept generation. HELIX acts as a syntax tether, enabling exploration of semantic diversity without violating the logical backbone required for valid output. This enables Multi-Temperature Synthesis, generating 200% more unique concepts than single-temperature inference.</description>

      <title>Agentic Unlearning: When LLM Agent Meets Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce \textbf{agentic unlearning} which removes specified information from both model parameters and persistent memory in agents with closed-loop interaction. Existing unlearning methods target parameters alone, leaving two critical gaps: (i) parameter-memory backflow, where retrieval reactivates parametric remnants or memory artifacts reintroduce sensitive content, and (ii) the absence of a unified strategy that covers both parameter and memory pathways. We present Synchronized Backflow Unlearning (SBU), a framework that unlearns jointly across parameter and memory pathways. The memory pathway performs dependency closure-based unlearning that prunes isolated entities while logically invalidating shared artifacts. The parameter pathway employs stochastic reference alignment to guide model outputs toward a high-entropy prior. These pathways are integrated via a synchronized dual-update protocol, forming a closed-loop mechanism where memory unlearning and parametric suppression reinforce each other to prevent cross-pathway recontamination. Experiments on medical QA benchmarks show that SBU reduces traces of targeted private information across both pathways with limited degradation on retained data.</description>

      <title>A Case Study of Selected PTQ Baselines for Reasoning LLMs on Ascend NPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is crucial for efficient model deployment, yet its effectiveness on Ascend NPU remains under-explored compared to GPU architectures. This paper presents a case study of representative PTQ baselines applied to reasoning-oriented models such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen series (1.5B/7B/14B) and QwQ-32B. We evaluate four distinct algorithms, including AWQ, GPTQ, SmoothQuant, and FlatQuant, to cover the spectrum from weight-only compression to advanced rotation-based methods. Our empirical results reveal significant platform sensitivity. While 4-bit weight-only quantization proves viable for larger models, aggressive 4-bit weight-activation schemes suffer from layer-wise calibration instability on the NPU, leading to logic collapse in long-context reasoning tasks. Conversely, standard 8-bit quantization remains numerically stable. Furthermore, a real-world INT8 deployment demonstrates that although optimized kernels reduce latency, dynamic quantization overheads currently limit end-to-end acceleration. These findings offer a practical reference for the feasibility and limitations of deploying quantized reasoning models on Ascend NPU.</description>

      <title>AsynDBT: Asynchronous Distributed Bilevel Tuning for efficient In-Context Learning with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), an increasing number of applications leverage cloud-based LLM APIs to reduce usage costs. However, since cloud-based models' parameters and gradients are agnostic, users have to manually or use heuristic algorithms to adjust prompts for intervening LLM outputs, which requiring costly optimization procedures. In-context learning (ICL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm that enables LLMs to adapt to new tasks using examples provided within the input, eliminating the need for parameter updates. Nevertheless, the advancement of ICL is often hindered by the lack of high-quality data, which is often sensitive and different to share. Federated learning (FL) offers a potential solution by enabling collaborative training of distributed LLMs while preserving data privacy. Despite this issues, previous FL approaches that incorporate ICL have struggled with severe straggler problems and challenges associated with heterogeneous non-identically data. To address these problems, we propose an asynchronous distributed bilevel tuning (AsynDBT) algorithm that optimizes both in-context learning samples and prompt fragments based on the feedback from the LLM, thereby enhancing downstream task performance. Benefiting from its distributed architecture, AsynDBT provides privacy protection and adaptability to heterogeneous computing environments. Furthermore, we present a theoretical analysis establishing the convergence guarantees of the proposed algorithm. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of AsynDBT.</description>

      <title>EXACT: Explicit Attribute-Guided Decoding-Time Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving personalized alignment requires adapting large language models to each user's evolving context. While decoding-time personalization offers a scalable alternative to training-time methods, existing methods largely rely on implicit, less interpretable preference representations and impose a rigid, context-agnostic user representation, failing to account for how preferences shift across prompts. We introduce EXACT, a new decoding-time personalization that aligns generation with limited pairwise preference feedback using a predefined set of interpretable attributes. EXACT first identifies user-specific attribute subsets by maximizing the likelihood of preferred responses in the offline stage. Then, for online inference, EXACT retrieves the most semantically relevant attributes for an incoming prompt and injects them into the context to steer generation. We establish theoretical approximation guarantees for the proposed algorithm under mild assumptions, and provably show that our similarity-based retrieval mechanism effectively mitigates contextual preference shifts, adapting to disparate tasks without pooling conflicting preferences. Extensive experiments on human-annotated preference datasets demonstrate that EXACT consistently outperforms strong baselines, including preference modeling accuracy and personalized generation quality.</description>

      <title>Can LLM Safety Be Ensured by Constraining Parameter Regions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often assumed to contain ``safety regions'' -- parameter subsets whose modification directly influences safety behaviors. We conduct a systematic evaluation of four safety region identification methods spanning different parameter granularities, from individual weights to entire Transformer layers, across four families of backbone LLMs with varying sizes. Using ten safety identification datasets, we find that the identified safety regions exhibit only low to moderate overlap, as measured by IoU. The overlap drops significantly when the safety regions are further refined using utility datasets (\ie non-harmful queries). These results suggest that current techniques fail to reliably identify a stable, dataset-agnostic safety region.</description>

      <title>Pimp My LLM: Leveraging Variability Modeling to Tune Inference Hyperparameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used across a wide range of tasks. However, their substantial computational demands raise concerns about the energy efficiency and sustainability of both training and inference. Inference, in particular, dominates total compute usage, making its optimization crucial. Recent research has explored optimization techniques and analyzed how configuration choices influence energy consumption. Yet, the vast configuration space of inference servers makes exhaustive empirical evaluation infeasible due to combinatorial explosion. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on this problem by treating LLMs as configurable systems and applying variability management techniques to systematically analyze inference-time configuration choices. We evaluate our approach on the Hugging Face Transformers library by representing generation hyperparameters and their constraints using a feature-based variability model, sampling representative configurations, measuring their energy consumption, latency, accuracy, and learning predictive models from the collected data. Our results show that variability modeling effectively manages the complexity of LLM inference configurations. It enables systematic analysis of hyperparameters effects and interactions, reveals trade-offs, and supports accurate prediction of inference behavior from a limited number of measurements. Overall, this work opens a new research direction that bridges software engineering and machine learning by leveraging variability modeling for the efficient and sustainable configuration of LLMs.</description>

      <title>ScaleBITS: Scalable Bitwidth Search for Hardware-Aligned Mixed-Precision LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-training weight quantization is crucial for reducing the memory and inference cost of large language models (LLMs), yet pushing the average precision below 4 bits remains challenging due to highly non-uniform weight sensitivity and the lack of principled precision allocation. Existing solutions use irregular fine-grained mixed-precision with high runtime overhead or rely on heuristics or highly constrained precision allocation strategies. In this work, we propose ScaleBITS, a mixed-precision quantization framework that enables automated, fine-grained bitwidth allocation under a memory budget while preserving hardware efficiency. Guided by a new sensitivity analysis, we introduce a hardware-aligned, block-wise weight partitioning scheme, powered by bi-directional channel reordering. We formulate global bitwidth allocation as a constrained optimization problem and develop a scalable approximation to the greedy algorithm, enabling end-to-end principled allocation. Experiments show that ScaleBITS significantly improves over uniform-precision quantization (up to +36%) and outperforms state-of-the-art sensitivity-aware baselines (up to +13%) in ultra-low-bit regime, without adding runtime overhead.</description>

      <title>Certified Learning under Distribution Shift: Sound Verification and Identifiable Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proposition. Let $f$ be a predictor trained on a distribution $P$ and evaluated on a shifted distribution $Q$. Under verifiable regularity and complexity constraints, the excess risk under shift admits an explicit upper bound determined by a computable shift metric and model parameters. We develop a unified framework in which (i) risk under distribution shift is certified by explicit inequalities, (ii) verification of learned models is sound for nontrivial sizes, and (iii) interpretability is enforced through identifiability conditions rather than post hoc explanations. All claims are stated with explicit assumptions. Failure modes are isolated. Non-certifiable regimes are characterized.</description>

      <title>MIDAS: Mosaic Input-Specific Differentiable Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS) provides efficient, gradient-based methods for automatically designing neural networks, yet its adoption remains limited in practice. We present MIDAS, a novel approach that modernizes DARTS by replacing static architecture parameters with dynamic, input-specific parameters computed via self-attention. To improve robustness, MIDAS (i) localizes the architecture selection by computing it separately for each spatial patch of the activation map, and (ii) introduces a parameter-free, topology-aware search space that models node connectivity and simplifies selecting the two incoming edges per node. We evaluate MIDAS on the DARTS, NAS-Bench-201, and RDARTS search spaces. In DARTS, it reaches 97.42% top-1 on CIFAR-10 and 83.38% on CIFAR-100. In NAS-Bench-201, it consistently finds globally optimal architectures. In RDARTS, it sets the state of the art on two of four search spaces on CIFAR-10. We further analyze why MIDAS works, showing that patchwise attention improves discrimination among candidate operations, and the resulting input-specific parameter distributions are class-aware and predominantly unimodal, providing reliable guidance for decoding.</description>

      <title>Parallel Complex Diffusion for Scalable Time Series Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling long-range dependencies in time series generation poses a fundamental trade-off between representational capacity and computational efficiency. Traditional temporal diffusion models suffer from local entanglement and the $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ cost of attention mechanisms. We address these limitations by introducing PaCoDi (Parallel Complex Diffusion), a spectral-native architecture that decouples generative modeling in the frequency domain. PaCoDi fundamentally alters the problem topology: the Fourier Transform acts as a diagonalizing operator, converting locally coupled temporal signals into globally decorrelated spectral components. Theoretically, we prove the Quadrature Forward Diffusion and Conditional Reverse Factorization theorem, demonstrating that the complex diffusion process can be split into independent real and imaginary branches. We bridge the gap between this decoupled theory and data reality using a \textbf{Mean Field Theory (MFT) approximation} reinforced by an interactive correction mechanism. Furthermore, we generalize this discrete DDPM to continuous-time Frequency SDEs, rigorously deriving the Spectral Wiener Process describe the differential spectral Brownian motion limit. Crucially, PaCoDi exploits the Hermitian Symmetry of real-valued signals to compress the sequence length by half, achieving a 50% reduction in attention FLOPs without information loss. We further derive a rigorous Heteroscedastic Loss to handle the non-isotropic noise distribution on the compressed manifold. Extensive experiments show that PaCoDi outperforms existing baselines in both generation quality and inference speed, offering a theoretically grounded and computationally efficient solution for time series modeling.</description>

      <title>Provable Adversarial Robustness in In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models adapt to new tasks through in-context learning (ICL) without parameter updates. Current theoretical explanations for this capability assume test tasks are drawn from a distribution similar to that seen during pretraining. This assumption overlooks adversarial distribution shifts that threaten real-world reliability. To address this gap, we introduce a distributionally robust meta-learning framework that provides worst-case performance guarantees for ICL under Wasserstein-based distribution shifts. Focusing on linear self-attention Transformers, we derive a non-asymptotic bound linking adversarial perturbation strength ($\rho$), model capacity ($m$), and the number of in-context examples ($N$). The analysis reveals that model robustness scales with the square root of its capacity ($\rho_{\text{max}} \propto \sqrt{m}$), while adversarial settings impose a sample complexity penalty proportional to the square of the perturbation magnitude ($N_\rho - N_0 \propto \rho^2$). Experiments on synthetic tasks confirm these scaling laws. These findings advance the theoretical understanding of ICL's limits under adversarial conditions and suggest that model capacity serves as a fundamental resource for distributional robustness.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimality of In-Context Learning with Selective State Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Bayesian optimal sequential prediction as a new principle for understanding in-context learning (ICL). Unlike interpretations framing Transformers as performing implicit gradient descent, we formalize ICL as meta-learning over latent sequence tasks. For tasks governed by Linear Gaussian State Space Models (LG-SSMs), we prove a meta-trained selective SSM asymptotically implements the Bayes-optimal predictor, converging to the posterior predictive mean. We further establish a statistical separation from gradient descent, constructing tasks with temporally correlated noise where the optimal Bayesian predictor strictly outperforms any empirical risk minimization (ERM) estimator. Since Transformers can be seen as performing implicit ERM, this demonstrates selective SSMs achieve lower asymptotic risk due to superior statistical efficiency. Experiments on synthetic LG-SSM tasks and a character-level Markov benchmark confirm selective SSMs converge faster to Bayes-optimal risk, show superior sample efficiency with longer contexts in structured-noise settings, and track latent states more robustly than linear Transformers. This reframes ICL from "implicit optimization" to "optimal inference," explaining the efficiency of selective SSMs and offering a principled basis for architecture design.</description>

      <title>Investigating Target Class Influence on Neural Network Compressibility for Energy-Autonomous Avian Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biodiversity loss poses a significant threat to humanity, making wildlife monitoring essential for assessing ecosystem health. Avian species are ideal subjects for this due to their popularity and the ease of identifying them through their distinctive songs. Traditionalavian monitoring methods require manual counting and are therefore costly and inefficient. In passive acoustic monitoring, soundscapes are recorded over long periods of time. The recordings are analyzed to identify bird species afterwards. Machine learning methods have greatly expedited this process in a wide range of species and environments, however, existing solutions require complex models and substantial computational resources. Instead, we propose running machine learning models on inexpensive microcontroller units (MCUs) directly in the field. Due to the resulting hardware and energy constraints, efficient artificial intelligence (AI) architecture is required. In this paper, we present our method for avian monitoring on MCUs. We trained and compressed models for various numbers of target classes to assess the detection of multiple bird species on edge devices and evaluate the influence of the number of species on the compressibility of neural networks. Our results demonstrate significant compression rates with minimal performance loss. We also provide benchmarking results for different hardware platforms and evaluate the feasibility of deploying energy-autonomous devices.</description>

      <title>Asking Forever: Universal Activations Behind Turn Amplification in Conversational LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-turn interaction length is a dominant factor in the operational costs of conversational LLMs. In this work, we present a new failure mode in conversational LLMs: turn amplification, in which a model consistently prolongs multi-turn interactions without completing the underlying task. We show that an adversary can systematically exploit clarification-seeking behavior$-$commonly encouraged in multi-turn conversation settings$-$to scalably prolong interactions. Moving beyond prompt-level behaviors, we take a mechanistic perspective and identify a query-independent, universal activation subspace associated with clarification-seeking responses. Unlike prior cost-amplification attacks that rely on per-turn prompt optimization, our attack arises from conversational dynamics and persists across prompts and tasks. We show that this mechanism provides a scalable pathway to induce turn amplification: both supply-chain attacks via fine-tuning and runtime attacks through low-level parameter corruptions consistently shift models toward abstract, clarification-seeking behavior across prompts. Across multiple instruction-tuned LLMs and benchmarks, our attack substantially increases turn count while remaining compliant. We also show that existing defenses offer limited protection against this emerging class of failures.</description>

      <title>Multi-material Multi-physics Topology Optimization with Physics-informed Gaussian Process Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has been increasingly used for topology optimization (TO). However, most existing ML-based approaches focus on simplified benchmark problems due to their high computational cost, spectral bias, and difficulty in handling complex physics. These limitations become more pronounced in multi-material, multi-physics problems whose objective or constraint functions are not self-adjoint. To address these challenges, we propose a framework based on physics-informed Gaussian processes (PIGPs). In our approach, the primary, adjoint, and design variables are represented by independent GP priors whose mean functions are parametrized via neural networks whose architectures are particularly beneficial for surrogate modeling of PDE solutions. We estimate all parameters of our model simultaneously by minimizing a loss that is based on the objective function, multi-physics potential energy functionals, and design-constraints. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed framework on benchmark TO problems such as compliance minimization, heat conduction optimization, and compliant mechanism design under single- and multi-material settings. Additionally, we leverage thermo-mechanical TO with single- and multi-material options as a representative multi-physics problem. We also introduce differentiation and integration schemes that dramatically accelerate the training process. Our results demonstrate that the proposed PIGP framework can effectively solve coupled multi-physics and design problems simultaneously -- generating super-resolution topologies with sharp interfaces and physically interpretable material distributions. We validate these results using open-source codes and the commercial software package COMSOL.</description>

      <title>Grassmannian Mixture-of-Experts: Concentration-Controlled Routing on Subspace Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts models rely on learned routers to assign tokens to experts, yet standard softmax gating provides no principled mechanism to control the tradeoff between sparsity and utilization. We propose Grassmannian MoE (GrMoE), a routing framework that operates on the Grassmannian manifold of subspaces, where gating weights arise from the concentration parameters of Matrix Bingham distributions. This construction yields a single, interpretable knob -- the concentration matrix $\Lambda$ -- that continuously controls routing entropy, replacing discrete top-$k$ selection with a smooth, geometrically principled sparsity mechanism. We further develop an amortized variational inference procedure for posterior routing distributions, enabling uncertainty-aware expert assignment that naturally resists expert collapse. We formally prove tight bounds relating the Bingham concentration spectrum to routing entropy, expected top-$k$ mass, and an exponential bound on expert collapse, establishing the first formal theory of concentration-controlled sparsity. On synthetic routing tasks, a 350M-parameter MoE language model with 8 experts, a 1.3B-parameter model with 16 experts, and a 2.7B-parameter model with 32 experts, GrMoE achieves 0\% routing collapse across all seeds, comparable or better perplexity with 15--30\% improved load balance, and a smooth monotonic relationship between concentration and effective sparsity that enables post-hoc sparsity tuning without retraining. Token-level analysis reveals that experts learn heterogeneous concentration values that correlate with linguistic specialization, providing interpretable routing behavior.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Adaptation: Bayesian Stiefel Manifold Priors for Reliable Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA enable practical adaptation of large language models but provide no principled uncertainty estimates, leading to poorly calibrated predictions and unreliable behavior under domain shift. We introduce Stiefel-Bayes Adapters (SBA), a Bayesian PEFT framework that places a Matrix Langevin prior over orthonormal adapter factors on the Stiefel manifold $\St$ and performs approximate posterior inference via tangent space Laplace approximation with geodesic retraction. Unlike Gaussian priors in flat space projected onto orthogonality constraints, our prior on the manifold naturally encodes the inductive bias that adapter subspaces should be well conditioned and orthogonal, while the posterior provides calibrated predictive uncertainty without recalibration. We prove formally that the tangent space approximation strictly avoids the structural variance inflation inherent in projecting from ambient space, establishing a rigorous theoretical advantage for intrinsic manifold inference. Across GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks on RoBERTa-large, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-2-13B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B, domain shift evaluations, selective prediction protocols, and an abstractive summarization task, SBA achieves task performance comparable to LoRA and DoRA while reducing Expected Calibration Error by 18 to 34\% over deterministic baselines, improving selective prediction AUROC by 12 to 25\% under domain shift, and outperforming deep ensembles of five LoRA models on OOD detection at a fraction of the parameter cost. Our results demonstrate that where you place uncertainty, on the right geometric structure, matters more than simply adding any Bayesian treatment to adapters.</description>

      <title>Avoid What You Know: Divergent Trajectory Balance for GFlowNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are a flexible family of amortized samplers trained to generate discrete and compositional objects with probability proportional to a reward function. However, learning efficiency is constrained by the model's ability to rapidly explore diverse high-probability regions during training. To mitigate this issue, recent works have focused on incentivizing the exploration of unvisited and valuable states via curiosity-driven search and self-supervised random network distillation, which tend to waste samples on already well-approximated regions of the state space. In this context, we propose Adaptive Complementary Exploration (ACE), a principled algorithm for the effective exploration of novel and high-probability regions when learning GFlowNets. To achieve this, ACE introduces an exploration GFlowNet explicitly trained to search for high-reward states in regions underexplored by the canonical GFlowNet, which learns to sample from the target distribution. Through extensive experiments, we show that ACE significantly improves upon prior work in terms of approximation accuracy to the target distribution and discovery rate of diverse high-reward states.</description>

      <title>Causality by Abstraction: Symbolic Rule Learning in Multivariate Timeseries with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring causal relations in timeseries data with delayed effects is a fundamental challenge, especially when the underlying system exhibits complex dynamics that cannot be captured by simple functional mappings. Traditional approaches often fail to produce generalized and interpretable explanations, as multiple distinct input trajectories may yield nearly indistinguishable outputs. In this work, we present ruleXplain, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract formal explanations for input-output relations in simulation-driven dynamical systems. Our method introduces a constrained symbolic rule language with temporal operators and delay semantics, enabling LLMs to generate verifiable causal rules through structured prompting. ruleXplain relies on the availability of a principled model (e.g., a simulator) that maps multivariate input time series to output time series. Within ruleXplain, the simulator is used to generate diverse counterfactual input trajectories that yield similar target output, serving as candidate explanations. Such counterfactual inputs are clustered and provided as context to the LLM, which is tasked with the generation of symbolic rules encoding the joint temporal trends responsible for the patterns observable in the output times series. A closed-loop refinement process ensures rule consistency and semantic validity. We validate the framework using the PySIRTEM epidemic simulator, mapping testing rate inputs to daily infection counts; and the EnergyPlus building energy simulator, observing temperature and solar irradiance inputs to electricity needs. For validation, we perform three classes of experiments: (1) the efficacy of the ruleset through input reconstruction; (2) ablation studies evaluating the causal encoding of the ruleset; and (3) generalization tests of the extracted rules across unseen output trends with varying phase dynamics.</description>

      <title>MePoly: Max Entropy Polynomial Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic Optimal Control provides a unified mathematical framework for solving complex decision-making problems, encompassing paradigms such as maximum entropy reinforcement learning(RL) and imitation learning(IL). However, conventional parametric policies often struggle to represent the multi-modality of the solutions. Though diffusion-based policies are aimed at recovering the multi-modality, they lack an explicit probability density, which complicates policy-gradient optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose MePoly, a novel policy parameterization based on polynomial energy-based models. MePoly provides an explicit, tractable probability density, enabling exact entropy maximization. Theoretically, we ground our method in the classical moment problem, leveraging the universal approximation capabilities for arbitrary distributions. Empirically, we demonstrate that MePoly effectively captures complex non-convex manifolds and outperforms baselines in performance across diverse benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Influence-Preserving Proxies for Gradient-Based Data Selection in LLM Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) relies critically on selecting training data that most benefits a model's downstream performance. Gradient-based data selection methods such as TracIn and Influence Functions leverage influence to identify useful samples, but their computational cost scales poorly, making them impractical for multi-billion-parameter large language models (LLMs). A common alternative is to use off-the-shelf smaller models as proxies, but they remain suboptimal since their learning dynamics are unclear, their sizes cannot be flexibly adjusted, and they cannot be further aligned with the target model in terms of gradient-based influence estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce Iprox, a two-stage framework that derives influence-preserving proxies directly from the target model. It first applies a low-rank compression stage to preserve influence information of the target model, and then an aligning stage to align both model gradients and logits, thereby constructing proxies that flexibly control computational cost while retaining the target model's influence. Experimental results across diverse LLM families and evaluation tasks show that Iprox consistently outperforms off-the-shelf proxies and baseline methods. On Qwen3-4B, a 1.5B proxy constructed with Iprox achieves stronger performance than the larger 1.7B off-the-shelf proxy. Notably, on Llama3.2, Iprox achieves better performance than baselines while reducing computational cost by more than half relative to the full 3B model. These results show that Iprox provides effective influence-preserving proxies, making gradient-based data selection more scalable for LLMs.</description>

      <title>Two Calm Ends and the Wild Middle: A Geometric Picture of Memorization in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models generate high-quality samples but can also memorize training data, raising serious privacy concerns. Understanding the mechanisms governing when memorization versus generalization occurs remains an active area of research. In particular, it is unclear where along the noise schedule memorization is induced, how data geometry influences it, and how phenomena at different noise scales interact. We introduce a geometric framework that partitions the noise schedule into three regimes based on the coverage properties of training data by Gaussian shells and the concentration behavior of the posterior, which we argue are two fundamental objects governing memorization and generalization in diffusion models. This perspective reveals that memorization risk is highly non-uniform across noise levels. We further identify a danger zone at medium noise levels where memorization is most pronounced. In contrast, both the small and large noise regimes resist memorization, but through fundamentally different mechanisms: small noise avoids memorization due to limited training coverage, while large noise exhibits low posterior concentration and admits a provably near linear Gaussian denoising behavior. For the medium noise regime, we identify geometric conditions through which we propose a geometry-informed targeted intervention that mitigates memorization.</description>

      <title>Dual Length Codes for Lossless Compression of BFloat16</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training and serving Large Language Models (LLMs) relies heavily on parallelization and collective operations, which are frequently bottlenecked by network bandwidth. Lossless compression using e.g., Huffman codes can alleviate the issue, however, Huffman codes suffer from slow, bit-sequential decoding and high hardware complexity due to deep tree traversals. Universal codes e.g., Exponential-Golomb codes are faster to decode but do not exploit the symbol frequency distributions. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Dual Length Codes, a hybrid approach designed to balance compression efficiency with decoding speed. Analyzing BFloat16 tensors from the Gemma model, we observed that the top 8 most frequent symbols account for approximately 50% of the cumulative probability. These 8 symbols are assigned a short 4 bit code. The remaining 248 symbols are assigned a longer 9 bit code. The coding scheme uses a single prefix bit to distinguish between the two code lengths. The scheme uses a small Look Up Table with only 8 entries for encoding and decoding. The scheme achieves a compressibility of 18.6% in comparison to 21.3% achieved by Huffman codes, but it significantly speeds up the decoding and simplifies the hardware complexity.</description>

      <title>Neural Prior Estimation: Learning Class Priors from Latent Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Class imbalance induces systematic bias in deep neural networks by imposing a skewed effective class prior. This work introduces the Neural Prior Estimator (NPE), a framework that learns feature-conditioned log-prior estimates from latent representations. NPE employs one or more Prior Estimation Modules trained jointly with the backbone via a one-way logistic loss. Under the Neural Collapse regime, NPE is analytically shown to recover the class log-prior up to an additive constant, providing a theoretically grounded adaptive signal without requiring explicit class counts or distribution-specific hyperparameters. The learned estimate is incorporated into logit adjustment, forming NPE-LA, a principled mechanism for bias-aware prediction. Experiments on long-tailed CIFAR and imbalanced semantic segmentation benchmarks (STARE, ADE20K) demonstrate consistent improvements, particularly for underrepresented classes. NPE thus offers a lightweight and theoretically justified approach to learned prior estimation and imbalance-aware prediction.</description>

      <title>Financial time series augmentation using transformer based GAN architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-series forecasting is a critical task across many domains, from engineering to economics, where accurate predictions drive strategic decisions. However, applying advanced deep learning models in challenging, volatile domains like finance is difficult due to the inherent limitation and dynamic nature of financial time series data. This scarcity often results in sub-optimal model training and poor generalization. The fundamental challenge lies in determining how to reliably augment scarce financial time series data to enhance the predictive accuracy of deep learning forecasting models. Our main contribution is a demonstration of how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can effectively serve as a data augmentation tool to overcome data scarcity in the financial domain. Specifically, we show that training a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) forecasting model on a dataset augmented with synthetic data generated by a transformer-based GAN (TTS-GAN) significantly improves the forecasting accuracy compared to using real data alone. We confirm these results across different financial time series (Bitcoin and S\&amp;P500 price data) and various forecasting horizons. Furthermore, we propose a novel, time series specific quality metric that combines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and a modified Deep Dataset Dissimilarity Measure (DeD-iMs) to reliably monitor the training progress and evaluate the quality of the generated data. These findings provide compelling evidence for the benefits of GAN-based data augmentation in enhancing financial predictive capabilities.</description>

      <title>ADAPT: Hybrid Prompt Optimization for LLM Feature Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding what features are encoded by learned directions in LLM activation space requires identifying inputs that strongly activate them. Feature visualization, which optimizes inputs to maximally activate a target direction, offers an alternative to costly dataset search approaches, but remains underexplored for LLMs due to the discrete nature of text. Furthermore, existing prompt optimization techniques are poorly suited to this domain, which is highly prone to local minima. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ADAPT, a hybrid method combining beam search initialization with adaptive gradient-guided mutation, designed around these failure modes. We evaluate on Sparse Autoencoder latents from Gemma 2 2B, proposing metrics grounded in dataset activation statistics to enable rigorous comparison, and show that ADAPT consistently outperforms prior methods across layers and latent types. Our results establish that feature visualization for LLMs is tractable, but requires design assumptions tailored to the domain.</description>

      <title>MantisV2: Closing the Zero-Shot Gap in Time Series Classification with Synthetic Data and Test-Time Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing foundation models for time series classification is of high practical relevance, as such models can serve as universal feature extractors for diverse downstream tasks. Although early models such as Mantis have shown the promise of this approach, a substantial performance gap remained between frozen and fine-tuned encoders. In this work, we introduce methods that significantly strengthen zero-shot feature extraction for time series. First, we introduce Mantis+, a variant of Mantis pre-trained entirely on synthetic time series. Second, through controlled ablation studies, we refine the architecture and obtain MantisV2, an improved and more lightweight encoder. Third, we propose an enhanced test-time methodology that leverages intermediate-layer representations and refines output-token aggregation. In addition, we show that performance can be further improved via self-ensembling and cross-model embedding fusion. Extensive experiments on UCR, UEA, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) benchmarks, and EEG datasets show that MantisV2 and Mantis+ consistently outperform prior time series foundation models, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Based Prediction of Surgical Outcomes in Chronic Rhinosinusitis from Clinical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly transformed medical prognostics by enabling rapid and accurate analysis across imaging and pathology. However, the investigation of machine learning predictions applied to prospectively collected, standardized data from observational clinical intervention trials remains underexplored, despite its potential to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), a persistent inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses lasting more than three months, imposes a substantial burden on quality of life (QoL) and societal cost. Although many patients respond to medical therapy, others with refractory symptoms often pursue surgical intervention. Surgical decision-making in CRS is complex, as it must weigh known procedural risks against uncertain individualized outcomes. In this study, we evaluated supervised machine learning models for predicting surgical benefit in CRS, using the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) as the primary patient-reported outcome. Our prospectively collected cohort from an observational intervention trial comprised patients who all underwent surgery; we investigated whether models trained only on preoperative data could identify patients who might not have been recommended surgery prior to the procedure. Across multiple algorithms, including an ensemble approach, our best model achieved approximately 85% classification accuracy, providing accurate and interpretable predictions of surgical candidacy. Moreover, on a held-out set of 30 cases spanning mixed difficulty, our model achieved 80% accuracy, exceeding the average prediction accuracy of expert clinicians (75.6%), demonstrating its potential to augment clinical decision-making and support personalized CRS care.</description>

      <title>COMBA: Cross Batch Aggregation for Learning Large Graphs with Context Gating State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have recently emerged for modeling long-range dependency in sequence data, with much simplified computational costs than modern alternatives, such as transformers. Advancing SMMs to graph structured data, especially for large graphs, is a significant challenge because SSMs are sequence models and the shear graph volumes make it very expensive to convert graphs as sequences for effective learning. In this paper, we propose COMBA to tackle large graph learning using state space models, with two key innovations: graph context gating and cross batch aggregation. Graph context refers to different hops of neighborhood for each node, and graph context gating allows COMBA to use such context to learn best control of neighbor aggregation. For each graph context, COMBA samples nodes as batches, and train a graph neural network (GNN), with information being aggregated cross batches, allowing COMBA to scale to large graphs. Our theoretical study asserts that cross-batch aggregation guarantees lower error than training GNN without aggregation. Experiments on benchmark networks demonstrate significant performance gains compared to baseline approaches. Code and benchmark datasets will be released for public access.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Correlation Plateau: On the Optimization and Capacity Limits of Attention-Based Regressors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention-based regression models are often trained by jointly optimizing Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) loss, emphasizing the magnitude of errors and the order or shape of targets, respectively. A common but poorly understood phenomenon during training is the PCC plateau: PCC stops improving early in training, even as MSE continues to decrease. We provide the first rigorous theoretical analysis of this behavior, revealing fundamental limitations in both optimization dynamics and model capacity. First, in regard to the flattened PCC curve, we uncover a critical conflict where lowering MSE (magnitude matching) can paradoxically suppress the PCC gradient (shape matching). This issue is exacerbated by the softmax attention mechanism, particularly when the data to be aggregated is highly homogeneous. Second, we identify a limitation in the model capacity: we derived a PCC improvement limit for any convex aggregator (including the softmax attention), showing that the convex hull of the inputs strictly bounds the achievable PCC gain. We demonstrate that data homogeneity intensifies both limitations. Motivated by these insights, we propose the Extrapolative Correlation Attention (ECA), which incorporates novel, theoretically-motivated mechanisms to improve the PCC optimization and extrapolate beyond the convex hull. Across diverse benchmarks, including challenging homogeneous data setting, ECA consistently breaks the PCC plateau, achieving significant improvements in correlation without compromising MSE performance.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Free Sequential Prediction with Abstentions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a sequential prediction problem in which an adversary is allowed to inject arbitrarily many adversarial instances in a stream of i.i.d.\ instances, but at each round, the learner may also \emph{abstain} from making a prediction without incurring any penalty if the instance was indeed corrupted. This semi-adversarial setting naturally sits between the classical stochastic case with i.i.d.\ instances for which function classes with finite VC dimension are learnable; and the adversarial case with arbitrary instances, known to be significantly more restrictive. For this problem, Goel et al. (2023) showed that, if the learner knows the distribution $\mu$ of clean samples in advance, learning can be achieved for all VC classes without restrictions on adversary corruptions. This is, however, a strong assumption in both theory and practice: a natural question is whether similar learning guarantees can be achieved without prior distributional knowledge, as is standard in classical learning frameworks (e.g., PAC learning or asymptotic consistency) and other non-i.i.d.\ models (e.g., smoothed online learning). We therefore focus on the distribution-free setting where $\mu$ is \emph{unknown} and propose an algorithm \textsc{AbstainBoost} based on a boosting procedure of weak learners, which guarantees sublinear error for general VC classes in \emph{distribution-free} abstention learning for oblivious adversaries. These algorithms also enjoy similar guarantees for adaptive adversaries, for structured function classes including linear classifiers. These results are complemented with corresponding lower bounds, which reveal an interesting polynomial trade-off between misclassification error and number of erroneous abstentions.</description>

      <title>MIRA: Memory-Integrated Reinforcement Learning Agent with Limited LLM Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents often suffer from high sample complexity in sparse or delayed reward settings due to limited prior structure. Large language models (LLMs) can provide subgoal decompositions, plausible trajectories, and abstract priors that facilitate early learning. However, heavy reliance on LLM supervision introduces scalability constraints and dependence on potentially unreliable signals. We propose MIRA (Memory-Integrated Reinforcement Learning Agent), which incorporates a structured, evolving memory graph to guide early training. The graph stores decision-relevant information, including trajectory segments and subgoal structures, and is constructed from both the agent's high-return experiences and LLM outputs. This design amortizes LLM queries into a persistent memory rather than requiring continuous real-time supervision. From this memory graph, we derive a utility signal that softly adjusts advantage estimation to influence policy updates without modifying the underlying reward function. As training progresses, the agent's policy gradually surpasses the initial LLM-derived priors, and the utility term decays, preserving standard convergence guarantees. We provide theoretical analysis showing that utility-based shaping improves early-stage learning in sparse-reward environments. Empirically, MIRA outperforms RL baselines and achieves returns comparable to approaches that rely on frequent LLM supervision, while requiring substantially fewer online LLM queries.

      <title>Memory-Based Advantage Shaping for LLM-Guided Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In environments with sparse or delayed rewards, reinforcement learning (RL) incurs high sample complexity due to the large number of interactions needed for learning. This limitation has motivated the use of large language models (LLMs) for subgoal discovery and trajectory guidance. While LLMs can support exploration, frequent reliance on LLM calls raises concerns about scalability and reliability. We address these challenges by constructing a memory graph that encodes subgoals and trajectories from both LLM guidance and the agent's own successful rollouts. From this graph, we derive a utility function that evaluates how closely the agent's trajectories align with prior successful strategies. This utility shapes the advantage function, providing the critic with additional guidance without altering the reward. Our method relies primarily on offline input and only occasional online queries, avoiding dependence on continuous LLM supervision. Preliminary experiments in benchmark environments show improved sample efficiency and faster early learning compared to baseline RL methods, with final returns comparable to methods that require frequent LLM interaction.</description>

      <title>Causal Neighbourhood Learning for Invariant Graph Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph data often contain noisy and spurious correlations that mask the true causal relationships, which are essential for enabling graph models to make predictions based on the underlying causal structure of the data. Dependence on spurious connections makes it challenging for traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generalize effectively across different graphs. Furthermore, traditional aggregation methods tend to amplify these spurious patterns, limiting model robustness under distribution shifts. To address these issues, we propose Causal Neighbourhood Learning with Graph Neural Networks (CNL-GNN), a novel framework that performs causal interventions on graph structure. CNL-GNN effectively identifies and preserves causally relevant connections and reduces spurious influences through the generation of counterfactual neighbourhoods and adaptive edge perturbation guided by learnable importance masking and an attention-based mechanism. In addition, by combining structural-level interventions with the disentanglement of causal features from confounding factors, the model learns invariant node representations that are robust and generalize well across different graph structures. Our approach improves causal graph learning beyond traditional feature-based methods, resulting in a robust classification model. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets, including multiple domain variants of one dataset, demonstrate that CNL-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models.</description>

      <title>Tighter Regret Lower Bound for Gaussian Process Bandits with Squared Exponential Kernel in Hypersphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an algorithm-independent, worst-case lower bound for the Gaussian process (GP) bandit problem in the frequentist setting, where the reward function is fixed and has a bounded norm in the known reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Specifically, we focus on the squared exponential (SE) kernel, one of the most widely used kernel functions in GP bandits. One of the remaining open questions for this problem is the gap in the \emph{dimension-dependent} logarithmic factors between upper and lower bounds. This paper partially resolves this open question under a hyperspherical input domain. We show that any algorithm suffers $\Omega(\sqrt{T (\ln T)^{d} (\ln \ln T)^{-d}})$ cumulative regret, where $T$ and $d$ represent the total number of steps and the dimension of the hyperspherical domain, respectively. Regarding the simple regret, we show that any algorithm requires $\Omega(\epsilon^{-2}(\ln \frac{1}{\epsilon})^d (\ln \ln \frac{1}{\epsilon})^{-d})$ time steps to find an $\epsilon$-optimal point. We also provide the improved $O((\ln T)^{d+1}(\ln \ln T)^{-d})$ upper bound on the maximum information gain for the SE kernel. Our results guarantee the optimality of the existing best algorithm up to \emph{dimension-independent} logarithmic factors under a hyperspherical input domain.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Graph Causal Classification Models: Estimating Causal Effects and Addressing Confounders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph data is becoming increasingly prevalent due to the growing demand for relational insights in AI across various domains. Organizations regularly use graph data to solve complex problems involving relationships and connections. Causal learning is especially important in this context, since it helps to understand cause-effect relationships rather than mere associations. Since many real-world systems are inherently causal, graphs can efficiently model these systems. However, traditional graph machine learning methods including graph neural networks (GNNs), rely on correlations and are sensitive to spurious patterns and distribution changes. On the other hand, causal models enable robust predictions by isolating true causal factors, thus making them more stable under such shifts. Causal learning also helps in identifying and adjusting for confounders, ensuring that predictions reflect true causal relationships and remain accurate even under interventions. To address these challenges and build models that are robust and causally informed, we propose CCAGNN, a Confounder-Aware causal GNN framework that incorporates causal reasoning into graph learning, supporting counterfactual reasoning and providing reliable predictions in real-world settings. Comprehensive experiments on six publicly available datasets from diverse domains show that CCAGNN consistently outperforms leading state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Generalization of Bilevel Programming in Hyperparameter Optimization: A Tale of Bias-Variance Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient-based hyperparameter optimization (HPO) have emerged recently, leveraging bilevel programming techniques to optimize hyperparameter by estimating hypergradient w.r.t. validation loss. Nevertheless, previous theoretical works mainly focus on reducing the gap between the estimation and ground-truth (i.e., the bias), while ignoring the error due to data distribution (i.e., the variance), which degrades performance. To address this issue, we conduct a bias-variance decomposition for hypergradient estimation error and provide a supplemental detailed analysis of the variance term ignored by previous works. We also present a comprehensive analysis of the error bounds for hypergradient estimation. This facilitates an easy explanation of some phenomena commonly observed in practice, like overfitting to the validation set. Inspired by the derived theories, we propose an ensemble hypergradient strategy to reduce the variance in HPO algorithms effectively. Experimental results on tasks including regularization hyperparameter learning, data hyper-cleaning, and few-shot learning demonstrate that our variance reduction strategy improves hypergradient estimation. To explain the improved performance, we establish a connection between excess error and hypergradient estimation, offering some understanding of empirical observations.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Probe of the Accuracy-Robustness Trade-off: Sharp Boundaries in Symmetry-Breaking Dimensional Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness is a pervasive phenomenon in deep learning, yet its geometric origin remains elusive. In this work, we utilize Symmetry-Breaking Dimensional Expansion (SBDE) as a controlled probe to investigate the mechanism underlying this trade-off. SBDE expands input images by inserting constant-valued pixels, which breaks translational symmetry and consistently improves clean accuracy (e.g., from $90.47\%$ to $95.63\%$ on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18) by reducing parameter degeneracy. However, this accuracy gain comes at the cost of reduced robustness against iterative white-box attacks. By employing a test-time \emph{mask projection} that resets the inserted auxiliary pixels to their training values, we demonstrate that the vulnerability stems almost entirely from the inserted dimensions. The projection effectively neutralizes the attacks and restores robustness, revealing that the model achieves high accuracy by creating \emph{sharp boundaries} (steep loss gradients) specifically along the auxiliary axes. Our findings provide a concrete geometric explanation for the accuracy-robustness paradox: the optimization landscape deepens the basin of attraction to improve accuracy but inevitably erects steep walls along the auxiliary degrees of freedom, creating a fragile sensitivity to off-manifold perturbations.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Friendly Input Expansion for Accelerating Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional function approximation is a fundamental problem in scientific computing and engineering applications. While neural networks possess powerful universal approximation capabilities, their optimization process is often hindered by flat loss landscapes induced by parameter-space symmetries, leading to slow convergence and poor generalization, particularly for high-frequency components. Inspired by the principle of \emph{symmetry breaking} in physics, this paper proposes a hardware-friendly approach for function approximation through \emph{input-space expansion}. The core idea involves augmenting the original one-dimensional input (e.g., $x$) with constant values (e.g., $\pi$) to form a higher-dimensional vector (e.g., $[\pi, \pi, x, \pi, \pi]$), effectively breaking parameter symmetries without increasing the network's parameter count. We evaluate the method on ten representative one-dimensional functions, including smooth, discontinuous, high-frequency, and non-differentiable functions. Experimental results demonstrate that input-space expansion significantly accelerates training convergence (reducing LBFGS iterations by 12\% on average) and enhances approximation accuracy (reducing final MSE by 66.3\% for the optimal 5D expansion). Ablation studies further reveal the effects of different expansion dimensions and constant selections, with $\pi$ consistently outperforming other constants. Our work proposes a low-cost, efficient, and hardware-friendly technique for algorithm design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online model selection in Bayesian bandits raises a fundamental exploration challenge: When an environment instance is sampled from a prior distribution, how can we design an adaptive strategy that explores multiple bandit learners and competes with the best one in hindsight? We address this problem by introducing a new Bayesian algorithm for online model selection in stochastic bandits. We prove an oracle-style guarantee of $O\left( d^* M \sqrt{T} + \sqrt{(MT)} \right)$ on the Bayesian regret, where $M$ is the number of base learners, $d^*$ is the regret coefficient of the optimal base learner, and $T$ is the time horizon. We also validate our method empirically across a range of stochastic bandit settings, demonstrating performance that is competitive with the best base learner. Additionally, we study the effect of sharing data among base learners and its role in mitigating prior mis-specification.</description>

      <title>Improving Generalizability of Hip Fracture Risk Prediction via Domain Adaptation Across Multiple Cohorts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical risk prediction models often fail to be generalized across cohorts because underlying data distributions differ by clinical site, region, demographics, and measurement protocols. This limitation is particularly pronounced in hip fracture risk prediction, where the performance of models trained on one cohort (the source cohort) can degrade substantially when deployed in other cohorts (target cohorts). We used a shared set of clinical and DXA-derived features across three large cohorts - the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS), and the UK Biobank (UKB), to systematically evaluate the performance of three domain adaptation methods - Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Correlation Alignment (CORAL), and Domain - Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) and their combinations. For a source cohort with males only and a source cohort with females only, domain-adaptation methods consistently showed improved performance than the no-adaptation baseline (source-only training), and the use of combinations of multiple domain adaptation methods delivered the largest and most stable gains. The method that combines MMD, CORAL, and DANN achieved the highest discrimination with the area under curve (AUC) of 0.88 for a source cohort with males only and 0.95 for a source cohort with females only), demonstrating that integrating multiple domain adaptation methods could produce feature representations that are less sensitive to dataset differences. Unlike existing methods that rely heavily on supervised tuning or assume known outcomes of samples in target cohorts, our outcome-free approaches enable the model selection under realistic deployment conditions and improve generalization of models in hip fracture risk prediction.</description>

      <title>Student Flow Modeling for School Decongestion via Stochastic Gravity Estimation and Constrained Spatial Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: School congestion, where student enrollment exceeds school capacity, is a major challenge in low- and middle-income countries. It highly impacts learning outcomes and deepens inequities in education. While subsidy programs that transfer students from public to private schools offer a mechanism to alleviate congestion without capital-intensive construction, they often underperform due to fragmented data systems that hinder effective implementation. The Philippine Educational Service Contracting program, one of the world's largest educational subsidy programs, exemplifies these challenges, falling short of its goal to decongest public schools. This prevents the science-based and data-driven analyses needed to understand what shapes student enrollment flows, particularly how families respond to economic incentives and spatial constraints. We introduce a computational framework for modeling student flow patterns and simulating policy scenarios. By synthesizing heterogeneous government data across nearly 3,000 institutions, we employ a stochastic gravity model estimated via negative binomial regression to derive behavioral elasticities for distance, net tuition cost, and socioeconomic determinants. These elasticities inform a doubly constrained spatial allocation mechanism that simulates student redistribution under varying subsidy amounts while respecting both origin candidate pools and destination slot capacities. We find that geographic proximity constrains school choice four times more strongly than tuition cost and that slot capacity, not subsidy amounts, is the binding constraint. Our work demonstrates that subsidy programs alone cannot resolve systemic overcrowding, and computational modeling can empower education policymakers to make equitable, data-driven decisions by revealing the structural constraints that shape effective resource allocation, even when resources are limited.</description>

      <title>Generating adversarial inputs for a graph neural network model of AC power flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work formulates and solves optimization problems to generate input points that yield high errors between a neural network's predicted AC power flow solution and solutions to the AC power flow equations. We demonstrate this capability on an instance of the CANOS-PF graph neural network model, as implemented by the PF$\Delta$ benchmark library, operating on a 14-bus test grid. Generated adversarial points yield errors as large as 3.4 per-unit in reactive power and 0.08 per-unit in voltage magnitude. When minimizing the perturbation from a training point necessary to satisfy adversarial constraints, we find that the constraints can be met with as little as an 0.04 per-unit perturbation in voltage magnitude on a single bus. This work motivates the development of rigorous verification and robust training methods for neural network surrogate models of AC power flow.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning for Pure Exploration in Continuous Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In active sequential testing, also termed pure exploration, a learner is tasked with the goal to adaptively acquire information so as to identify an unknown ground-truth hypothesis with as few queries as possible. This problem, originally studied by Chernoff in 1959, has several applications: classical formulations include Best-Arm Identification (BAI) in bandits, where actions index hypotheses, and generalized search problems, where strategically chosen queries reveal partial information about a hidden label. In many modern settings, however, the hypothesis space is continuous and naturally coincides with the query/action space: for example, identifying an optimal action in a continuous-armed bandit, localizing an $\epsilon$-ball contained in a target region, or estimating the minimizer of an unknown function from a sequence of observations. In this work, we study pure exploration in such continuous spaces and introduce Continuous In-Context Pure Exploration for this regime. We introduce C-ICPE-TS, an algorithm that meta-trains deep neural policies to map observation histories to (i) the next continuous query action and (ii) a predicted hypothesis, thereby learning transferable sequential testing strategies directly from data. At inference time, C-ICPE-TS actively gathers evidence on previously unseen tasks and infers the true hypothesis without parameter updates or explicit hand-crafted information models. We validate C-ICPE-TS across a range of benchmarks, spanning continuous best-arm identification, region localization, and function minimizer identification.</description>

      <title>Learning Optimal and Sample-Efficient Decision Policies with Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paradigm of decision-making has been revolutionised by reinforcement learning and deep learning. Although this has led to significant progress in domains such as robotics, healthcare, and finance, the use of RL in practice is challenging, particularly when learning decision policies in high-stakes applications that may require guarantees. Traditional RL algorithms rely on a large number of online interactions with the environment, which is problematic in scenarios where online interactions are costly, dangerous, or infeasible. However, learning from offline datasets is hindered by the presence of hidden confounders. Such confounders can cause spurious correlations in the dataset and can mislead the agent into taking suboptimal or adversarial actions. Firstly, we address the problem of learning from offline datasets in the presence of hidden confounders. We work with instrumental variables (IVs) to identify the causal effect, which is an instance of a conditional moment restrictions (CMR) problem. Inspired by double/debiased machine learning, we derive a sample-efficient algorithm for solving CMR problems with convergence and optimality guarantees, which outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. Secondly, we relax the conditions on the hidden confounders in the setting of (offline) imitation learning, and adapt our CMR estimator to derive an algorithm that can learn effective imitator policies with convergence rate guarantees. Finally, we consider the problem of learning high-level objectives expressed in linear temporal logic (LTL) and develop a provably optimal learning algorithm that improves sample efficiency over existing methods. Through evaluation on reinforcement learning benchmarks and synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, we demonstrate the usefulness of the methods developed in this thesis in real-world decision making.</description>

      <title>Learning Without Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning is at the heart of managing the real-world problems associated with massive data. With the success of neural networks on such large-scale problems, more research in machine learning is being conducted now than ever before. This dissertation focuses on three different projects rooted in mathematical theory for machine learning applications.
  The first project deals with supervised learning and manifold learning. In theory, one of the main problems in supervised learning is that of function approximation: that is, given some data set $\mathcal{D}=\{(x_j,f(x_j))\}_{j=1}^M$, can one build a model $F\approx f$? We introduce a method which aims to remedy several of the theoretical shortcomings of the current paradigm for supervised learning.
  The second project deals with transfer learning, which is the study of how an approximation process or model learned on one domain can be leveraged to improve the approximation on another domain. We study such liftings of functions when the data is assumed to be known only on a part of the whole domain. We are interested in determining subsets of the target data space on which the lifting can be defined, and how the local smoothness of the function and its lifting are related.
  The third project is concerned with the classification task in machine learning, particularly in the active learning paradigm. Classification has often been treated as an approximation problem as well, but we propose an alternative approach leveraging techniques originally introduced for signal separation problems. We introduce theory to unify signal separation with classification and a new algorithm which yields competitive accuracy to other recent active learning algorithms while providing results much faster.</description>

      <title>Turbo Connection: Reasoning as Information Flow from Higher to Lower Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex problems, whether in math, logic, or planning, are solved by humans through a sequence of steps where the result of one step informs the next. In this work, we adopt the perspective that the reasoning power of Transformers is fundamentally limited by a fixed maximum number of steps along any latent path of computation. To address this, we introduce Turbo Connection (TurboConn), a novel architecture that overcomes the fixed-depth constraint by routing multiple residual connections from the higher-layer hidden states of each token $t$ to the lower layers of token $t+1$. Fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs with our method not only yields accuracy gains of 0.9% to over 10% on benchmarks like GSM8K, Parity, and multi-step arithmetic, but also demonstrates that the density of these backward connections is critical; our dense interaction significantly outperforms "sparse" alternatives that only pass a single hidden state or vector. Notably, TurboConn can be integrated into pre-trained LLMs to overcome task-specific plateaus: while a fine-tuned Qwen-3-1.7B achieves only 53.78% on Parity, adding our architectural modification enables the model to reach 100% accuracy, all without the necessity to retrain the full model from scratch or sophisticated curriculum learning. Our results provide strong empirical evidence that the depth of the computational path is a key factor in reasoning ability, also offering a new mechanism to enhance LLMs without significantly affecting generation latency.</description>

      <title>Whole-Brain Connectomic Graph Model Enables Whole-Body Locomotion Control in Fruit Fly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whole-brain biological neural networks naturally support the learning and control of whole-body movements. However, the use of brain connectomes as neural network controllers in embodied reinforcement learning remains unexplored. We investigate using the exact neural architecture of an adult fruit fly's brain for the control of its body movement. We develop Fly-connectomic Graph Model (FlyGM), whose static structure is identical to the complete connectome of an adult Drosophila for whole-body locomotion control. To perform dynamical control, FlyGM represents the static connectome as a directed message-passing graph to impose a biologically grounded information flow from sensory inputs to motor outputs. Integrated with a biomechanical fruit fly model, our method achieves stable control across diverse locomotion tasks without task-specific architectural tuning. To verify the structural advantages of the connectome-based model, we compare it against a degree-preserving rewired graph, a random graph, and multilayer perceptrons, showing that FlyGM yields higher sample efficiency and superior performance. This work demonstrates that static brain connectomes can be transformed to instantiate effective neural policy for embodied learning of movement control.</description>

      <title>PHAST: Port-Hamiltonian Architecture for Structured Temporal Dynamics Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real physical systems are dissipative -- a pendulum slows, a circuit loses charge to heat -- and forecasting their dynamics from partial observations is a central challenge in scientific machine learning. We address the \emph{position-only} (q-only) problem: given only generalized positions~$q_t$ at discrete times (momenta~$p_t$ latent), learn a structured model that (a)~produces stable long-horizon forecasts and (b)~recovers physically meaningful parameters when sufficient structure is provided. The port-Hamiltonian framework makes the conservative-dissipative split explicit via $\dot{x}=(J-R)\nabla H(x)$, guaranteeing $dH/dt\le 0$ when $R\succeq 0$. We introduce \textbf{PHAST} (Port-Hamiltonian Architecture for Structured Temporal dynamics), which decomposes the Hamiltonian into potential~$V(q)$, mass~$M(q)$, and damping~$D(q)$ across three knowledge regimes (KNOWN, PARTIAL, UNKNOWN), uses efficient low-rank PSD/SPD parameterizations, and advances dynamics with Strang splitting. Across thirteen q-only benchmarks spanning mechanical, electrical, molecular, thermal, gravitational, and ecological systems, PHAST achieves the best long-horizon forecasting among competitive baselines and enables physically meaningful parameter recovery when the regime provides sufficient anchors. We show that identification is fundamentally ill-posed without such anchors (gauge freedom), motivating a two-axis evaluation that separates forecasting stability from identifiability.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Heavy-Tailed Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy-tailed stochastic gradient noise, commonly observed in transformer models, can destabilize the optimization process. Recent works mainly focus on developing and understanding approaches to address heavy-tailed noise in the centralized or distributed, synchronous setting, leaving the interactions between such noise and asynchronous optimization underexplored. In this work, we investigate two communication schemes that handle stragglers with asynchronous updates in the presence of heavy-tailed gradient noise. We propose and theoretically analyze algorithmic modifications based on delay-aware learning rate scheduling and delay compensation to enhance the performance of asynchronous algorithms. Our convergence guarantees under heavy-tailed noise match the rate of the synchronous counterparts and improve delay tolerance compared with existing asynchronous approaches. Empirically, our approaches outperform prior synchronous and asynchronous methods in terms of accuracy/runtime trade-offs and are more robust to hyperparameters in both image and language tasks.</description>

      <title>NIMMGen: Learning Neural-Integrated Mechanistic Digital Twins with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanistic models encode scientific knowledge about dynamical systems and are widely used in downstream scientific and policy applications. Recent work has explored LLM-based agentic frameworks to automatically construct mechanistic models from data; however, existing problem settings substantially oversimplify real-world conditions, leaving it unclear whether LLM-generated mechanistic models are reliable in practice. To address this gap, we introduce the Neural-Integrated Mechanistic Modeling (NIMM) evaluation framework, which evaluates LLM-generated mechanistic models under realistic settings with partial observations and diversified task objectives. Our evaluation reveals fundamental challenges in current baselines, ranging from model effectiveness to code-level correctness. Motivated by these findings, we design NIMMgen, an agentic framework for neural-integrated mechanistic modeling that enhances code correctness and practical validity through iterative refinement. Experiments across three datasets from diversified scientific domains demonstrate its strong performance. We also show that the learned mechanistic models support counterfactual intervention simulation.</description>

      <title>Flow Actor-Critic for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dataset distributions in offline reinforcement learning (RL) often exhibit complex and multi-modal distributions, necessitating expressive policies to capture such distributions beyond widely-used Gaussian policies. To handle such complex and multi-modal datasets, in this paper, we propose Flow Actor-Critic, a new actor-critic method for offline RL, based on recent flow policies. The proposed method not only uses the flow model for actor as in previous flow policies but also exploits the expressive flow model for conservative critic acquisition to prevent Q-value explosion in out-of-data regions. To this end, we propose a new form of critic regularizer based on the flow behavior proxy model obtained as a byproduct of flow-based actor design. Leveraging the flow model in this joint way, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance for test datasets of offline RL including the D4RL and recent OGBench benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Gradient Regularization Prevents Reward Hacking in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Verifiable Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) or Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are two key steps in the post-training of modern Language Models (LMs). A common problem is reward hacking, where the policy may exploit inaccuracies of the reward and learn an unintended behavior. Most previous works address this by limiting the policy update with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) penalty towards a reference model. We propose a different framing: Train the LM in a way that biases policy updates towards regions in which the reward is more accurate. First, we derive a theoretical connection between the accuracy of a reward model and the flatness of an optimum at convergence. Gradient regularization (GR) can then be used to bias training to flatter regions and thereby maintain reward model accuracy. We confirm these results by showing that the gradient norm and reward accuracy are empirically correlated in RLHF. We then show that Reference Resets of the KL penalty implicitly use GR to find flatter regions with higher reward accuracy. We further improve on this by proposing to use explicit GR with an efficient finite-difference estimate. Empirically, GR performs better than a KL penalty across a diverse set of RL experiments with LMs. GR achieves a higher GPT-judged win-rate in RLHF, avoids overly focusing on the format in rule-based math rewards, and prevents hacking the judge in LLM-as-a-Judge math tasks.</description>

      <title>Continual-NExT: A Unified Comprehension And Generation Continual Learning Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual-to-Dual MLLMs refer to Multimodal Large Language Models, which can enable unified multimodal comprehension and generation through text and image modalities. Although exhibiting strong instantaneous learning and generalization capabilities, Dual-to-Dual MLLMs still remain deficient in lifelong evolution, significantly affecting continual adaptation to dynamic real-world scenarios. One of the challenges is that learning new tasks inevitably destroys the learned knowledge. Beyond traditional catastrophic forgetting, Dual-to-Dual MLLMs face other challenges, including hallucination, instruction unfollowing, and failures in cross-modal knowledge transfer. However, no standardized continual learning framework for Dual-to-Dual MLLMs has been established yet, leaving these challenges unexplored. Thus, in this paper, we establish Continual-NExT, a continual learning framework for Dual-to-Dual MLLMs with deliberately-architected evaluation metrics. To improve the continual learning capability of Dual-to-Dual MLLMs, we propose an efficient MAGE (Mixture and Aggregation of General LoRA and Expert LoRA) method to further facilitate knowledge transfer across modalities and mitigate forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGE outperforms other continual learning methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

Abstract: Physics-informed deep learning models have emerged as powerful tools for learning dynamical systems. These models directly encode physical principles into network architectures. However, systematic benchmarking of these approaches across diverse physical phenomena remains limited, particularly in conservative and dissipative systems. In addition, benchmarking that has been done thus far does not integrate out full trajectories to check stability. In this work, we benchmark three prominent physics-informed architectures such as Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNN), Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNN), and Symplectic Recurrent Neural Networks (SRNN) using the DeepChem framework, an open-source scientific machine learning library. We evaluate these models on six dynamical systems spanning classical conservative mechanics (mass-spring system, simple pendulum, double pendulum, and three-body problem, spring-pendulum) and non-conservative systems with contact (bouncing ball). We evaluate models by computing error on predicted trajectories and evaluate error both quantitatively and qualitatively. We find that all benchmarked models struggle to maintain stability for chaotic or nonconservative systems. Our results suggest that more research is needed for physics-informed deep learning models to learn robust models of classical mechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Balancing Symmetry and Efficiency in Graph Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equivariance is central to graph generative models, as it ensures the model respects the permutation symmetry of graphs. However, strict equivariance can increase computational cost due to added architectural constraints, and can slow down convergence because the model must be consistent across a large space of possible node permutations. We study this trade-off for graph generative models. Specifically, we start from an equivariant discrete flow-matching model, and relax its equivariance during training via a controllable symmetry modulation scheme based on sinusoidal positional encodings and node permutations. Experiments first show that symmetry-breaking can accelerate early training by providing an easier learning signal, but at the expense of encouraging shortcut solutions that can cause overfitting, where the model repeatedly generates graphs that are duplicates of the training set. On the contrary, properly modulating the symmetry signal can delay overfitting while accelerating convergence, allowing the model to reach stronger performance with $19\%$ of the baseline training epochs.</description>

      <title>TempoNet: Slack-Quantized Transformer-Guided Reinforcement Scheduler for Adaptive Deadline-Centric Real-Time Dispatchs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time schedulers must reason about tight deadlines under strict compute budgets. We present TempoNet, a reinforcement learning scheduler that pairs a permutation-invariant Transformer with a deep Q-approximation. An Urgency Tokenizer discretizes temporal slack into learnable embeddings, stabilizing value learning and capturing deadline proximity. A latency-aware sparse attention stack with blockwise top-k selection and locality-sensitive chunking enables global reasoning over unordered task sets with near-linear scaling and sub-millisecond inference. A multicore mapping layer converts contextualized Q-scores into processor assignments through masked-greedy selection or differentiable matching. Extensive evaluations on industrial mixed-criticality traces and large multiprocessor settings show consistent gains in deadline fulfillment over analytic schedulers and neural baselines, together with improved optimization stability. Diagnostics include sensitivity analyses for slack quantization, attention-driven policy interpretation, hardware-in-the-loop and kernel micro-benchmarks, and robustness under stress with simple runtime mitigations; we also report sample-efficiency benefits from behavioral-cloning pretraining and compatibility with an actor-critic variant without altering the inference pipeline. These results establish a practical framework for Transformer-based decision making in high-throughput real-time scheduling.</description>

      <title>Non-Stationary Online Resource Allocation: Learning from a Single Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study online resource allocation under non-stationary demand with a minimum offline data requirement. In this problem, a decision-maker must allocate multiple types of resources to sequentially arriving queries over a finite horizon. Each query belongs to a finite set of types with fixed resource consumption and a stochastic reward drawn from an unknown, type-specific distribution. Critically, the environment exhibits arbitrary non-stationarity -- arrival distributions may shift unpredictably-while the algorithm requires only one historical sample per period to operate effectively. We distinguish two settings based on sample informativeness: (i) reward-observed samples containing both query type and reward realization, and (ii) the more challenging type-only samples revealing only query type information.
  We propose a novel type-dependent quantile-based meta-policy that decouples the problem into modular components: reward distribution estimation, optimization of target service probabilities via fluid relaxation, and real-time decisions through dynamic acceptance thresholds. For reward-observed samples, our static threshold policy achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. For type-only samples, we first establish that sublinear regret is impossible without additional structure; under a mild minimum-arrival-probability assumption, we design both a partially adaptive policy attaining the same $\tilde{O}({T})$ bound and, more significantly, a fully adaptive resolving policy with careful rounding that achieves the first poly-logarithmic regret guarantee of $O((\log T)^3)$ for non-stationary multi-resource allocation. Our framework advances prior work by operating with minimal offline data (one sample per period), handling arbitrary non-stationarity without variation-budget assumptions, and supporting multiple resource constraints.</description>

      <title>Cut Less, Fold More: Model Compression through the Lens of Projection Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compressing neural networks without retraining is vital for deployment at scale. We study calibration-free compression through the lens of projection geometry: structured pruning is an axis-aligned projection, whereas model folding performs a low-rank projection via weight clustering. We formalize both as orthogonal operators and show that, within a rank distance of one, folding provably yields smaller parameter reconstruction error, and under mild smoothness assumptions, smaller functional perturbations than pruning. At scale, we evaluate &gt;1000 checkpoints spanning ResNet18, PreActResNet18, ViT-B/32, and CLIP ViT-B/32 on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K, covering diverse training hyperparameters (optimizers, learning rates, augmentations, regularization, sharpness-aware training), as well as multiple LLaMA-family 60M and 130M parameter models trained on C4. We show that folding typically achieves higher post-compression accuracy, with the largest gains at moderate-high compression. The gap narrows and occasionally reverses at specific training setups. Our results position folding as a geometry-aware, calibration-free alternative to pruning that is often superior in practice and principled in theory.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching with Injected Noise for Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models have recently demonstrated remarkable success across diverse domains, motivating their adoption as expressive policies in reinforcement learning (RL). While they have shown strong performance in offline RL, particularly where the target distribution is well defined, their extension to online fine-tuning has largely been treated as a direct continuation of offline pre-training, leaving key challenges unaddressed. In this paper, we propose Flow Matching with Injected Noise for Offline-to-Online RL (FINO), a novel method that leverages flow matching-based policies to enhance sample efficiency for offline-to-online RL. FINO facilitates effective exploration by injecting noise into policy training, thereby encouraging a broader range of actions beyond those observed in the offline dataset. In addition to exploration-enhanced flow policy training, we combine an entropy-guided sampling mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation, allowing the policy to adapt its behavior throughout online fine-tuning. Experiments across diverse, challenging tasks demonstrate that FINO consistently achieves superior performance under limited online budgets.</description>

      <title>Learning Long-Range Dependencies with Temporal Predictive Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive Coding (PC) is a biologically-inspired learning framework characterised by local, parallelisable operations, properties that enable energy-efficient implementation on neuromorphic hardware. Despite this, extending PC effectively to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) has been challenging, particularly for tasks involving long-range temporal dependencies. Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) remains the dominant method for training RNNs, but its non-local computation, lack of spatial parallelism, and requirement to store extensive activation histories results in significant energy consumption. This work introduces a novel method combining Temporal Predictive Coding (tPC) with approximate Real-Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL), enabling effective spatio-temporal credit assignment. Results indicate that the proposed method can closely match the performance of BPTT on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world tasks. On a challenging machine translation task, with a 15-million parameter model, the proposed method achieves a test perplexity of 7.62 (vs. 7.49 for BPTT), marking one of the first applications of tPC to tasks of this scale. These findings demonstrate the potential of this method to learn complex temporal dependencies whilst retaining the local, parallelisable, and flexible properties of the original PC framework, paving the way for more energy-efficient learning systems.</description>

      <title>Advection-Diffusion on Graphs: A Bakry-Emery Laplacian for Spectral Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to propagate information across long distances due to oversmoothing and oversquashing. Existing remedies such as graph transformers or rewiring typically incur high computational cost or require altering the graph structure. We introduce a Bakry-Emery graph Laplacian that integrates diffusion and advection through a learnable node-wise potential, inducing task-dependent propagation dynamics without modifying topology. This operator has a well-behaved spectral decomposition and acts as a drop-in replacement for standard Laplacians in spectral GNNs. Building on this insight, we develop mu-ChebNet, a spectral architecture that jointly learns the potential and Chebyshev filters, effectively bridging message-passing adaptivity and spectral efficiency. Our theoretical analysis shows how the potential modulates the spectrum, enabling control of key graph properties. Empirically, mu-ChebNet delivers consistent gains on synthetic long-range reasoning tasks, as well as real-world benchmarks, while offering an interpretable routing field that reveals how information flows through the graph. This establishes the Bakry-Emery Laplacian as a principled and efficient foundation for adaptive spectral graph learning.</description>

      <title>Stable Long-Horizon Spatiotemporal Prediction on Meshes Using Latent Multiscale Recurrent Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate long-horizon prediction of spatiotemporal fields on complex geometries is a fundamental challenge in scientific machine learning, with applications such as additive manufacturing where temperature histories govern defect formation and mechanical properties. High-fidelity simulations are accurate but computationally costly, and despite recent advances, machine learning methods remain challenged by long-horizon temperature and gradient prediction. We propose a deep learning framework for predicting full temperature histories directly on meshes, conditioned on geometry and process parameters, while maintaining stability over thousands of time steps and generalizing across heterogeneous geometries. The framework adopts a temporal multiscale architecture composed of two coupled models operating at complementary time scales. Both models rely on a latent recurrent graph neural network to capture spatiotemporal dynamics on meshes, while a variational graph autoencoder provides a compact latent representation that reduces memory usage and improves training stability. Experiments on simulated powder bed fusion data demonstrate accurate and temporally stable long-horizon predictions across diverse geometries, outperforming existing baseline. Although evaluated in two dimensions, the framework is general and extensible to physics-driven systems with multiscale dynamics and to three-dimensional geometries.</description>

      <title>Unifying Formal Explanations: A Complexity-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work has explored the computational complexity of deriving two fundamental types of explanations for ML model predictions: (1) *sufficient reasons*, which are subsets of input features that, when fixed, determine a prediction, and (2) *contrastive reasons*, which are subsets of input features that, when modified, alter a prediction. Prior studies have examined these explanations in different contexts, such as non-probabilistic versus probabilistic frameworks and local versus global settings. In this study, we introduce a unified framework for analyzing these explanations, demonstrating that they can all be characterized through the minimization of a unified probabilistic value function. We then prove that the complexity of these computations is influenced by three key properties of the value function: (1) *monotonicity*, (2) *submodularity*, and (3) *supermodularity* - which are three fundamental properties in *combinatorial optimization*. Our findings uncover some counterintuitive results regarding the nature of these properties within the explanation settings examined. For instance, although the *local* value functions do not exhibit monotonicity or submodularity/supermodularity whatsoever, we demonstrate that the *global* value functions do possess these properties. This distinction enables us to prove a series of novel polynomial-time results for computing various explanations with provable guarantees in the global explainability setting, across a range of ML models that span the interpretability spectrum, such as neural networks, decision trees, and tree ensembles. In contrast, we show that even highly simplified versions of these explanations become NP-hard to compute in the corresponding local explainability setting.</description>

      <title>A Deep Surrogate Model for Robust and Generalizable Long-Term Blast Wave Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the spatio-temporal dynamics of blast wave propagation remains a longstanding challenge due to its highly nonlinear behavior, sharp gradients, and burdensome computational cost. While machine learning-based surrogate models offer fast inference as a promising alternative, they suffer from degraded accuracy, particularly evaluated on complex urban layouts or out-of-distribution scenarios. Moreover, autoregressive prediction strategies in such models are prone to error accumulation over long forecasting horizons, limiting their robustness for extended-time simulations. To address these limitations, we propose RGD-Blast, a robust and generalizable deep surrogate model for high-fidelity, long-term blast wave forecasting. RGD-Blast incorporates a multi-scale module to capture both global flow patterns and local boundary interactions, effectively mitigating error accumulation during autoregressive prediction. We introduce a dynamic-static feature coupling mechanism that fuses time-varying pressure fields with static source and layout features, thereby enhancing out-of-distribution generalization. Experiments demonstrate that RGD-Blast achieves a two-order-of-magnitude speedup over traditional numerical methods while maintaining comparable accuracy. In generalization tests on unseen building layouts, the model achieves an average RMSE below 0.01 and an R2 exceeding 0.89 over 280 consecutive time steps. Additional evaluations under varying blast source locations and explosive charge weights further validate its generalization, substantially advancing the state of the art in long-term blast wave modeling.</description>

      <title>SeedFlood: A Step Toward Scalable Decentralized Training of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a new approach to decentralized training-SeedFlood-designed to scale for large models across complex network topologies and achieve global consensus with minimal communication overhead. Traditional gossip-based methods suffer from message communication costs that grow with model size, while information decay over network hops renders global consensus inefficient. SeedFlood departs from these practices by exploiting the seed-reconstructible structure of zeroth-order updates and effectively making the messages near-zero in size, allowing them to be flooded to every client in the network. This mechanism makes communication overhead negligible and independent of model size, removing the primary scalability bottleneck in decentralized training. Consequently, SeedFlood enables training in regimes previously considered impractical, such as billion-parameter models distributed across hundreds of clients. Our experiments on decentralized LLM fine-tuning demonstrate thatSeedFlood consistently outperforms gossip-based baselines in both generalization performance and communication efficiency, and even achieves results comparable to first-order methods in large scale settings.</description>

      <title>Capabilities Ain't All You Need: Measuring Propensities in AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI evaluation has primarily focused on measuring capabilities, with formal approaches inspired from Item Response Theory (IRT) being increasingly applied. Yet propensities - the tendencies of models to exhibit particular behaviours - play a central role in determining both performance and safety outcomes. However, traditional IRT describes a model's success on a task as a monotonic function of model capabilities and task demands, an approach unsuited to propensities, where both excess and deficiency can be problematic. Here, we introduce the first formal framework for measuring AI propensities by using a bilogistic formulation for model success, which attributes high success probability when the model's propensity is within an "ideal band". Further, we estimate the limits of the ideal band using LLMs equipped with newly developed task-agnostic rubrics. Applying our framework to six families of LLM models whose propensities are incited in either direction, we find that we can measure how much the propensity is shifted and what effect this has on the tasks. Critically, propensities estimated using one benchmark successfully predict behaviour on held-out tasks. Moreover, we obtain stronger predictive power when combining propensities and capabilities than either separately. More broadly, our framework showcases how rigorous propensity measurements can be conducted and how it yields gains over solely using capability evaluations to predict AI behaviour.</description>

      <title>LERD: Latent Event-Relational Dynamics for Neurodegenerative Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) alters brain electrophysiology and disrupts multichannel EEG dynamics, making accurate and clinically useful EEG-based diagnosis increasingly important for screening and disease monitoring. However, many existing approaches rely on black-box classifiers and do not explicitly model the underlying dynamics that generate observed signals. To address these limitations, we propose LERD, an end-to-end Bayesian electrophysiological neural dynamical system that infers latent neural events and their relational structure directly from multichannel EEG without event or interaction annotations. LERD combines a continuous-time event inference module with a stochastic event-generation process to capture flexible temporal patterns, while incorporating an electrophysiology-inspired dynamical prior to guide learning in a principled way. We further provide theoretical analysis that yields a tractable bound for training and stability guarantees for the inferred relational dynamics. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and two real-world AD EEG cohorts demonstrate that LERD consistently outperforms strong baselines and yields physiology-aligned latent summaries that help characterize group-level dynamical differences.</description>

      <title>RAT+: Train Dense, Infer Sparse -- Recurrence Augmented Attention for Dilated Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured dilated attention has an appealing inference-time efficiency knob: it reduces the FLOPs of the attention and the KV cache size by a factor of the dilation size D, while preserving long-range connectivity. However, we find a persistent failure mode of them -- sparsifying a pretrained attention model to a dilated pattern leads to severe accuracy degradation. We introduce RAT+, a dense-pretraining architecture that augments attention with full-sequence recurrence and active recurrence learning. A single RAT+ model is pretrained densely once, then flexibly switched at inference time to dilated attention (optionally with local windows) or hybrid layer/head compositions, requiring only a short 1B-token resolution adaptation rather than retraining separate sparse models. At 1.5B parameters trained on 100B tokens, RAT+ closely matches dense accuracy at 16 and drops by about 2-3 points at 64 on commonsense reasoning and LongBench tasks, respectively. Moreover, RAT+ outperforms attention when sparsifying to the top-k block attention. We further scale to 2.6B parameters and 200B tokens and observe the same trend.</description>

      <title>Generative Model via Quantile Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Generative models (DGMs) play two key roles in modern machine learning: (i) producing new information (e.g., image synthesis) and (ii) reducing dimensionality. However, traditional architectures often rely on auxiliary networks such as encoders in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or discriminators in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which introduce training instability, computational overhead, and risks like mode collapse. We present NeuroSQL, a new generative paradigm that eliminates the need for auxiliary networks by learning low-dimensional latent representations implicitly. NeuroSQL leverages an asymptotic approximation that expresses the latent variables as the solution to an optimal transportation problem. Specifically, NeuroSQL learns the latent variables by solving a linear assignment problem and then passes the latent information to a standalone generator. We benchmark its performance against GANs, VAEs, and a budget-matched diffusion baseline on four datasets: handwritten digits (MNIST), faces (CelebA), animal faces (AFHQ), and brain images (OASIS). Compared to VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models: (1) in terms of image quality, NeuroSQL achieves overall lower mean pixel distance between synthetic and authentic images and stronger perceptual/structural fidelity; (2) computationally, NeuroSQL requires the least training time; and (3) practically, NeuroSQL provides an effective solution for generating synthetic data with limited training samples. By embracing quantile assignment rather than an encoder, NeuroSQL provides a fast, stable, and robust way to generate synthetic data with minimal information loss.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Efficient Domain Adaptation of Physics-Informed Self-Attention based GNNs for AC Power Flow Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate AC-PF prediction under domain shift is critical when models trained on medium-voltage (MV) grids are deployed on high-voltage (HV) networks. Existing physics-informed graph neural solvers typically rely on full fine-tuning for cross-regime transfer, incurring high retraining cost and offering limited control over the stability-plasticity trade-off between target-domain adaptation and source-domain retention. We study parameter-efficient domain adaptation for physics-informed self-attention based GNN, encouraging Kirchhoff-consistent behavior via a physics-based loss while restricting adaptation to low-rank updates. Specifically, we apply LoRA to attention projections with selective unfreezing of the prediction head to regulate adaptation capacity. This design yields a controllable efficiency-accuracy trade-off for physics-constrained inverse estimation under voltage-regime shift. Across multiple grid topologies, the proposed LoRA+PHead adaptation recovers near-full fine-tuning accuracy with a target-domain RMSE gap of $2.6\times10^{-4}$ while reducing the number of trainable parameters by 85.46%. The physics-based residual remains comparable to full fine-tuning; however, relative to Full FT, LoRA+PHead reduces MV source retention by 4.7 percentage points (17.9% vs. 22.6%) under domain shift, while still enabling parameter-efficient and physically consistent AC-PF estimation.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in multi-agent negotiation tasks, yet evaluation in this domain remains challenging due to a lack of robust and generalizable benchmarks. Abdelnabi et al. (2024) introduce a negotiation benchmark based on Scoreable Games, with the aim of developing a highly complex and realistic evaluation framework for LLMs. Our work investigates the reproducibility of claims in their benchmark, and provides a deeper understanding of its usability and generalizability. We replicate the original experiments on additional models, and introduce additional metrics to verify negotiation quality and evenness of evaluation. Our findings reveal that while the benchmark is indeed complex, model comparison is ambiguous, raising questions about its objectivity. Furthermore, we identify limitations in the experimental setup, particularly in information leakage detection and thoroughness of the ablation study. By examining and analyzing the behavior of a wider range of models on an extended version of the benchmark, we reveal insights that provide additional context to potential users. Our results highlight the importance of context in model-comparative evaluations.</description>

      <title>Neural-HSS: Hierarchical Semi-Separable Neural PDE Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have shown remarkable effectiveness in solving PDEs, largely due to their ability to enable fast simulations once trained. However, despite the availability of high-performance computing infrastructure, many critical applications remain constrained by the substantial computational costs associated with generating large-scale, high-quality datasets and training models. In this work, inspired by studies on the structure of Green's functions for elliptic PDEs, we introduce Neural-HSS, a parameter-efficient architecture built upon the Hierarchical Semi-Separable (HSS) matrix structure that is provably data-efficient for a broad class of PDEs. We theoretically analyze the proposed architecture, proving that it satisfies exactness properties even in very low-data regimes. We also investigate its connections with other architectural primitives, such as the Fourier neural operator layer and convolutional layers. We experimentally validate the data efficiency of Neural-HSS on the three-dimensional Poisson equation over a grid of two million points, demonstrating its superior ability to learn from data generated by elliptic PDEs in the low-data regime while outperforming baseline methods. Finally, we demonstrate its capability to learn from data arising from a broad class of PDEs in diverse domains, including electromagnetism, fluid dynamics, and biology.</description>

      <title>Variational Distributional Neuron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a proof of concept for a variational distributional neuron: a compute unit formulated as a VAE brick, explicitly carrying a prior, an amortized posterior and a local ELBO. The unit is no longer a deterministic scalar but a distribution: computing is no longer about propagating values, but about contracting a continuous space of possibilities under constraints. Each neuron parameterizes a posterior, propagates a reparameterized sample and is regularized by the KL term of a local ELBO - hence, the activation is distributional. This "contraction" becomes testable through local constraints and can be monitored via internal measures. The amount of contextual information carried by the unit, as well as the temporal persistence of this information, are locally tuned by distinct constraints. This proposal addresses a structural tension: in sequential generation, causality is predominantly organized in the symbolic space and, even when latents exist, they often remain auxiliary, while the effective dynamics are carried by a largely deterministic decoder. In parallel, probabilistic latent models capture factors of variation and uncertainty, but that uncertainty typically remains borne by global or parametric mechanisms, while units continue to propagate scalars - hence the pivot question: if uncertainty is intrinsic to computation, why does the compute unit not carry it explicitly? We therefore draw two axes: (i) the composition of probabilistic constraints, which must be made stable, interpretable and controllable; and (ii) granularity: if inference is a negotiation of distributions under constraints, should the primitive unit remain deterministic or become distributional? We analyze "collapse" modes and the conditions for a "living neuron", then extend the contribution over time via autoregressive priors over the latent, per unit.</description>

      <title>MEG-to-MEG Transfer Learning and Cross-Task Speech/Silence Detection with Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-efficient neural decoding is a central challenge for speech brain-computer interfaces. We present the first demonstration of transfer learning and cross-task decoding for MEG-based speech models spanning perception and production. We pre-train a Conformer-based model on 50 hours of single-subject listening data and fine-tune on just 5 minutes per subject across 18 participants. Transfer learning yields consistent improvements, with in-task accuracy gains of 1-4% and larger cross-task gains of up to 5-6%. Not only does pre-training improve performance within each task, but it also enables reliable cross-task decoding between perception and production. Critically, models trained on speech production decode passive listening above chance, confirming that learned representations reflect shared neural processes rather than task-specific motor activity.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Framework for LLM-Based Model Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated methods for discovering mechanistic simulator models from observational data offer a promising path toward accelerating scientific progress. Such methods often take the form of agentic-style iterative workflows that repeatedly propose and revise candidate models by imitating human discovery processes. However, existing LLM-based approaches typically implement such workflows via hand-crafted heuristic procedures, without an explicit probabilistic formulation. We recast model discovery as probabilistic inference, i.e., as sampling from an unknown distribution over mechanistic models capable of explaining the data. This perspective provides a unified way to reason about model proposal, refinement, and selection within a single inference framework. As a concrete instantiation of this view, we introduce ModelSMC, an algorithm based on Sequential Monte Carlo sampling. ModelSMC represents candidate models as particles which are iteratively proposed and refined by an LLM, and weighted using likelihood-based criteria. Experiments on real-world scientific systems illustrate that this formulation discovers models with interpretable mechanisms and improves posterior predictive checks. More broadly, this perspective provides a probabilistic lens for understanding and developing LLM-based approaches to model discovery.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Parallel Reward Integration with Symmetry for MORL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies heterogeneous Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL), where objectives can differ sharply in temporal frequency. Such heterogeneity allows dense objectives to dominate learning, while sparse long-horizon rewards receive weak credit assignment, leading to poor sample efficiency. We propose a Parallel Reward Integration with Symmetry (PRISM) algorithm that enforces reflectional symmetry as an inductive bias in aligning reward channels. PRISM introduces ReSymNet, a theory-motivated model that reconciles temporal-frequency mismatches across objectives, using residual blocks to learn a scaled opportunity value that accelerates exploration while preserving the optimal policy. We also propose SymReg, a reflectional equivariance regulariser that enforces agent mirroring and constrains policy search to a reflection-equivariant subspace. This restriction provably reduces hypothesis complexity and improves generalisation. Across MuJoCo benchmarks, PRISM consistently outperforms both a sparse-reward baseline and an oracle trained with full dense rewards, improving Pareto coverage and distributional balance: it achieves hypervolume gains exceeding 100\% over the baseline and up to 32\% over the oracle.

      <title>Decoding as Optimisation on the Probability Simplex: From Top-K to Top-P (Nucleus) to Best-of-K Samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding sits between a language model and everything we do with it, yet it is still treated as a heuristic knob-tuning exercise. We argue decoding should be understood as a principled optimisation layer: at each token, we solve a regularised problem over the probability simplex that trades off model score against structural preferences and constraints. This single template recovers greedy decoding, Softmax sampling, Top-K, Top-P, and Sparsemax-style sparsity as special cases, and explains their common structure through optimality conditions. More importantly, the framework makes it easy to invent new decoders without folklore. We demonstrate this by designing Best-of-K (BoK), a KL-anchored coverage objective aimed at multi-sample pipelines (self-consistency, reranking, verifier selection). BoK targets the probability of covering good alternatives within a fixed K-sample budget and improves empirical performance. We show that such samples can improve accuracy by, for example, +18.6% for Qwen2.5-Math-7B on MATH500 at high sampling temperatures.</description>

      <title>Analyzing and Improving Chain-of-Thought Monitorability Through Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) monitors are LLM-based systems that analyze reasoning traces to detect when outputs may exhibit attributes of interest, such as test-hacking behavior during code generation. In this paper, we use information-theoretic analysis to show that non-zero mutual information between CoT and output is a necessary but not sufficient condition for CoT monitorability. We identify two sources of approximation error that may undermine the performance of CoT monitors in practice: information gap, which measures the extent to which the monitor can extract the information available in CoT, and elicitation error, which measures the extent to which the monitor approximates the optimal monitoring function. We further demonstrate that CoT monitorability can be systematically improved through targeted training objectives. To this end, we propose two complementary approaches: (a) an oracle-based method that directly rewards the monitored model for producing CoTs that maximize monitor accuracy, and (b) a more practical, label-free approach that maximizes conditional mutual information between outputs and CoTs. Across multiple different environments, we show both methods significantly improve monitor accuracy while preventing CoT degeneration even when training against a monitor, thereby mitigating reward hacking when the task reward is imperfectly specified.</description>

      <title>On the Semantic and Syntactic Information Encoded in Proto-Tokens for One-Step Text Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) generate text token-by-token, requiring n forward passes to produce a sequence of length n. Recent work, Exploring the Latent Capacity of LLMs for One-Step Text Reconstruction (Mezentsev and Oseledets), shows that frozen LLMs can reconstruct hundreds of tokens from only two learned proto-tokens in a single forward pass, suggesting a path beyond the autoregressive paradigm. In this paper, we study what information these proto-tokens encode and how they behave under reconstruction and controlled constraints. We perform a series of experiments aimed at disentangling semantic and syntactic content in the two proto-tokens, analyzing stability properties of the e-token, and visualizing attention patterns to the e-token during reconstruction. Finally, we test two regularization schemes for "imposing" semantic structure on the e-token using teacher embeddings, including an anchor-based loss and a relational distillation objective. Our results indicate that the m-token tends to capture semantic information more strongly than the e-token under standard optimization; anchor-based constraints trade off sharply with reconstruction accuracy; and relational distillation can transfer batch-level semantic relations into the proto-token space without sacrificing reconstruction quality, supporting the feasibility of future non-autoregressive seq2seq systems that predict proto-tokens as an intermediate representation.</description>

      <title>JPmHC Dynamical Isometry via Orthogonal Hyper-Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning, exemplified by Hyper-Connections (HC), have expanded the residual connection paradigm by introducing wider residual streams and diverse connectivity patterns. While these innovations yield significant performance gains, they compromise the identity mapping property of residual connections, leading to training instability, limited scalability, and increased memory overhead. To address these challenges, we propose JPmHC (Jacobian-spectrum Preserving manifold-constrained Hyper-Connections), a framework that replaces identity skips with a trainable linear mixer acting on n parallel streams while explicitly controlling gradient conditioning. By constraining the mixer M on operator-norm-bounded manifolds (e.g., bistochastic, Stiefel, Grassmann), JPmHC prevents gradient pathologies and enhances stability. JPmHC introduces three key contributions: (i) a free-probability analysis that predicts Jacobian spectra for structured skips, providing actionable design rules for mixer selection; (ii) memory-efficient implicit differentiation for fixed-point projections, reducing activation memory and synchronization overhead; and (iii) a Stiefel-constrained mixer via Cayley transforms, ensuring orthogonality without post-hoc normalization. Empirical evaluations on ARC-AGI demonstrate that JPmHC achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, and lower computational cost compared to bistochastic baselines. As a flexible and scalable extension of HC, JPmHC advances spectrum-aware, stable, and efficient deep learning, offering insights into topological architecture design and foundational model evolution.</description>

      <title>On the "Induction Bias" in Sequence Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable practical success of transformer-based language models, recent work has raised concerns about their ability to perform state tracking. In particular, a growing body of literature has shown this limitation primarily through failures in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, such as length extrapolation. In this work, we shift attention to the in-distribution implications of these limitations. We conduct a large-scale experimental study of the data efficiency of transformers and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) across multiple supervision regimes. We find that the amount of training data required by transformers grows much more rapidly with state-space size and sequence length than for RNNs. Furthermore, we analyze the extent to which learned state-tracking mechanisms are shared across different sequence lengths. We show that transformers exhibit negligible or even detrimental weight sharing across lengths, indicating that they learn length-specific solutions in isolation. In contrast, recurrent models exhibit effective amortized learning by sharing weights across lengths, allowing data from one sequence length to improve performance on others. Together, these results demonstrate that state tracking remains a fundamental challenge for transformers, even when training and evaluation distributions match.</description>

      <title>Explaining AutoClustering: Uncovering Meta-Feature Contribution in AutoML for Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AutoClustering methods aim to automate unsupervised learning tasks, including algorithm selection (AS), hyperparameter optimization (HPO), and pipeline synthesis (PS), by often leveraging meta-learning over dataset meta-features. While these systems often achieve strong performance, their recommendations are often difficult to justify: the influence of dataset meta-features on algorithm and hyperparameter choices is typically not exposed, limiting reliability, bias diagnostics, and efficient meta-feature engineering. This limits reliability and diagnostic insight for further improvements. In this work, we investigate the explainability of the meta-models in AutoClustering. We first review 22 existing methods and organize their meta-features into a structured taxonomy. We then apply a global explainability technique (i.e., Decision Predicate Graphs) to assess feature importance within meta-models from selected frameworks. Finally, we use local explainability tools such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to analyse specific clustering decisions. Our findings highlight consistent patterns in meta-feature relevance, identify structural weaknesses in current meta-learning strategies that can distort recommendations, and provide actionable guidance for more interpretable Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) design. This study therefore offers a practical foundation for increasing decision transparency in unsupervised learning automation.</description>

      <title>FedZMG: Efficient Client-Side Optimization in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed model training on edge devices while preserving data privacy. However, clients tend to have non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data, which often leads to client-drift, and therefore diminishing convergence speed and model performance. While adaptive optimizers have been proposed to mitigate these effects, they frequently introduce computational complexity or communication overhead unsuitable for resource-constrained IoT environments. This paper introduces Federated Zero Mean Gradients (FedZMG), a novel, parameter-free, client-side optimization algorithm designed to tackle client-drift by structurally regularizing the optimization space. Advancing the idea of Gradient Centralization, FedZMG projects local gradients onto a zero-mean hyperplane, effectively neutralizing the "intensity" or "bias" shifts inherent in heterogeneous data distributions without requiring additional communication or hyperparameter tuning. A theoretical analysis is provided, proving that FedZMG reduces the effective gradient variance and guarantees tighter convergence bounds compared to standard FedAvg. Extensive empirical evaluations on EMNIST, CIFAR100, and Shakespeare datasets demonstrate that FedZMG achieves better convergence speed and final validation accuracy compared to the baseline FedAvg and the adaptive optimizer FedAdam, particularly in highly non-IID settings.</description>

      <title>PRISM-FCP: Byzantine-Resilient Federated Conformal Prediction via Partial Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose PRISM-FCP (Partial shaRing and robust calIbration with Statistical Margins for Federated Conformal Prediction), a Byzantine-resilient federated conformal prediction framework that utilizes partial model sharing to improve robustness against Byzantine attacks during both model training and conformal calibration. Existing approaches address adversarial behavior only in the calibration stage, leaving the learned model susceptible to poisoned updates. In contrast, PRISM-FCP mitigates attacks end-to-end. During training, clients partially share updates by transmitting only $M$ of $D$ parameters per round. This attenuates the expected energy of an adversary's perturbation in the aggregated update by a factor of $M/D$, yielding lower mean-square error (MSE) and tighter prediction intervals. During calibration, clients convert nonconformity scores into characterization vectors, compute distance-based maliciousness scores, and downweight or filter suspected Byzantine contributions before estimating the conformal quantile. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and the UCI Superconductivity dataset demonstrate that PRISM-FCP maintains nominal coverage guarantees under Byzantine attacks while avoiding the interval inflation observed in standard FCP with reduced communication, providing a robust and communication-efficient approach to federated uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Leakage and Second-Order Dynamics Improve Hippocampal RNN Replay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological neural networks (like the hippocampus) can internally generate "replay" resembling stimulus-driven activity. Recent computational models of replay use noisy recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained to path-integrate. Replay in these networks has been described as Langevin sampling, but new modifiers of noisy RNN replay have surpassed this description. We re-examine noisy RNN replay as sampling to understand or improve it in three ways: (1) Under simple assumptions, we prove that the gradients replay activity should follow are time-varying and difficult to estimate, but readily motivate the use of hidden state leakage in RNNs for replay. (2) We confirm that hidden state adaptation (negative feedback) encourages exploration in replay, but show that it incurs non-Markov sampling that also slows replay. (3) We propose the first model of temporally compressed replay in noisy path-integrating RNNs through hidden state momentum, connect it to underdamped Langevin sampling, and show that, together with adaptation, it counters slowness while maintaining exploration. We verify our findings via path-integration of 2D triangular and T-maze paths and of high-dimensional paths of synthetic rat place cell activity.</description>

      <title>Scientific Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning for Vessel Power Prediction: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of main engine power is essential for vessel performance optimization, fuel efficiency, and compliance with emission regulations. Conventional machine learning approaches, such as Support Vector Machines, variants of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and tree-based methods like Random Forests, Extra Tree Regressors, and XGBoost, can capture nonlinearities but often struggle to respect the fundamental propeller law relationship between power and speed, resulting in poor extrapolation outside the training envelope. This study introduces a hybrid modeling framework that integrates physics-based knowledge from sea trials with data-driven residual learning. The baseline component, derived from calm-water power curves of the form $P = cV^n$, captures the dominant power-speed dependence, while another, nonlinear, regressor is then trained to predict the residual power, representing deviations caused by environmental and operational conditions. By constraining the machine learning task to residual corrections, the hybrid model simplifies learning, improves generalization, and ensures consistency with the underlying physics. In this study, an XGBoost, a simple Neural Network, and a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) coupled with the baseline component were compared to identical models without the baseline component. Validation on in-service data demonstrates that the hybrid model consistently outperformed a pure data-driven baseline in sparse data regions while maintaining similar performance in populated ones. The proposed framework provides a practical and computationally efficient tool for vessel performance monitoring, with applications in weather routing, trim optimization, and energy efficiency planning.</description>

      <title>Unifying approach to uniform expressivity of graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expressive power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is often analysed via correspondence to the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithm and fragments of first-order logic. Standard GNNs are limited to performing aggregation over immediate neighbourhoods or over global read-outs. To increase their expressivity, recent attempts have been made to incorporate substructural information (e.g. cycle counts and subgraph properties). In this paper, we formalize this architectural trend by introducing Template GNNs (T-GNNs), a generalized framework where node features are updated by aggregating over valid template embeddings from a specified set of graph templates. We propose a corresponding logic, Graded template modal logic (GML(T)), and generalized notions of template-based bisimulation and WL algorithm. We establish an equivalence between the expressive power of T-GNNs and GML(T), and provide a unifying approach for analysing GNN expressivity: we show how standard AC-GNNs and its recent variants can be interpreted as instantiations of T-GNNs.</description>

      <title>Subgroups of $U(d)$ Induce Natural RNN and Transformer Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a direct framework for sequence models with hidden states on closed subgroups of U(d). We use a minimal axiomatic setup and derive recurrent and transformer templates from a shared skeleton in which subgroup choice acts as a drop-in replacement for state space, tangent projection, and update map. We then specialize to O(d) and evaluate orthogonal-state RNN and transformer models on Tiny Shakespeare and Penn Treebank under parameter-matched settings. We also report a general linear-mixing extension in tangent space, which applies across subgroup choices and improves finite-budget performance in the current O(d) experiments.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Noise: Why Diffusion Models Don't Need Noise Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous (noise-agnostic) generative models, such as Equilibrium Matching and blind diffusion, challenge the standard paradigm by learning a single, time-invariant vector field that operates without explicit noise-level conditioning. While recent work suggests that high-dimensional concentration allows these models to implicitly estimate noise levels from corrupted observations, a fundamental paradox remains: what is the underlying landscape being optimized when the noise level is treated as a random variable, and how can a bounded, noise-agnostic network remain stable near the data manifold where gradients typically diverge? We resolve this paradox by formalizing Marginal Energy, $E_{\text{marg}}(\mathbf{u}) = -\log p(\mathbf{u})$, where $p(\mathbf{u}) = \int p(\mathbf{u}|t)p(t)dt$ is the marginal density of the noisy data integrated over a prior distribution of unknown noise levels. We prove that generation using autonomous models is not merely blind denoising, but a specific form of Riemannian gradient flow on this Marginal Energy. Through a novel relative energy decomposition, we demonstrate that while the raw Marginal Energy landscape possesses a $1/t^p$ singularity normal to the data manifold, the learned time-invariant field implicitly incorporates a local conformal metric that perfectly counteracts the geometric singularity, converting an infinitely deep potential well into a stable attractor. We also establish the structural stability conditions for sampling with autonomous models. We identify a ``Jensen Gap'' in noise-prediction parameterizations that acts as a high-gain amplifier for estimation errors, explaining the catastrophic failure observed in deterministic blind models. Conversely, we prove that velocity-based parameterizations are inherently stable because they satisfy a bounded-gain condition that absorbs posterior uncertainty into a smooth geometric drift.</description>

      <title>Assigning Confidence: K-partition Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering is widely used for unsupervised structure discovery, yet it offers limited insight into how reliable each individual assignment is. Diagnostics, such as convergence behavior or objective values, may reflect global quality, but they do not indicate whether particular instances are assigned confidently, especially for initialization-sensitive algorithms like k-means. This assignment-level instability can undermine both accuracy and robustness. Ensemble approaches improve global consistency by aggregating multiple runs, but they typically lack tools for quantifying pointwise confidence in a way that combines cross-run agreement with geometric support from the learned cluster structure. We introduce CAKE (Confidence in Assignments via K-partition Ensembles), a framework that evaluates each point using two complementary statistics computed over a clustering ensemble: assignment stability and consistency of local geometric fit. These are combined into a single, interpretable score in [0,1]. Our theoretical analysis shows that CAKE remains effective under noise and separates stable from unstable points. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets indicate that CAKE effectively highlights ambiguous points and stable core members, providing a confidence ranking that can guide filtering or prioritization to improve clustering quality.</description>

      <title>Trojans in Artificial Intelligence (TrojAI) Final Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) launched the TrojAI program to confront an emerging vulnerability in modern artificial intelligence: the threat of AI Trojans. These AI trojans are malicious, hidden backdoors intentionally embedded within an AI model that can cause a system to fail in unexpected ways, or allow a malicious actor to hijack the AI model at will. This multi-year initiative helped to map out the complex nature of the threat, pioneered foundational detection methods, and identified unsolved challenges that require ongoing attention by the burgeoning AI security field. This report synthesizes the program's key findings, including methodologies for detection through weight analysis and trigger inversion, as well as approaches for mitigating Trojan risks in deployed models. Comprehensive test and evaluation results highlight detector performance, sensitivity, and the prevalence of "natural" Trojans. The report concludes with lessons learned and recommendations for advancing AI security research.</description>

      <title>When &amp; How to Write for Personalized Demand-aware Query Rewriting in Video Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In video search systems, user historical behaviors provide rich context for identifying search intent and resolving ambiguity. However, traditional methods utilizing implicit history features often suffer from signal dilution and delayed feedback. To address these challenges, we propose WeWrite, a novel Personalized Demand-aware Query Rewriting framework. Specifically, WeWrite tackles three key challenges: (1) When to Write: An automated posterior-based mining strategy extracts high-quality samples from user logs, identifying scenarios where personalization is strictly necessary; (2) How to Write: A hybrid training paradigm combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to align the LLM's output style with the retrieval system; (3) Deployment: A parallel "Fake Recall" architecture ensures low latency. Online A/B testing on a large-scale video platform demonstrates that WeWrite improves the Click-Through Video Volume (VV$&gt;$10s) by 1.07% and reduces the Query Reformulation Rate by 2.97%.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Traps: Rational Misalignment Driven by Model Misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid deployment of Large Language Models and AI agents across critical societal and technical domains is hindered by persistent behavioral pathologies including sycophancy, hallucination, and strategic deception that resist mitigation via reinforcement learning. Current safety paradigms treat these failures as transient training artifacts, lacking a unified theoretical framework to explain their emergence and stability. Here we show that these misalignments are not errors, but mathematically rationalizable behaviors arising from model misspecification. By adapting Berk-Nash Rationalizability from theoretical economics to artificial intelligence, we derive a rigorous framework that models the agent as optimizing against a flawed subjective world model. We demonstrate that widely observed failures are structural necessities: unsafe behaviors emerge as either a stable misaligned equilibrium or oscillatory cycles depending on reward scheme, while strategic deception persists as a "locked-in" equilibrium or through epistemic indeterminacy robust to objective risks. We validate these theoretical predictions through behavioral experiments on six state-of-the-art model families, generating phase diagrams that precisely map the topological boundaries of safe behavior. Our findings reveal that safety is a discrete phase determined by the agent's epistemic priors rather than a continuous function of reward magnitude. This establishes Subjective Model Engineering, defined as the design of an agent's internal belief structure, as a necessary condition for robust alignment, marking a paradigm shift from manipulating environmental rewards to shaping the agent's interpretation of reality.</description>

      <title>IRPAPERS: A Visual Document Benchmark for Scientific Retrieval and Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI systems have achieved remarkable success in processing text and relational data, yet visual document processing remains relatively underexplored. Whereas traditional systems require OCR transcriptions to convert these visual documents into text and metadata, recent advances in multimodal foundation models offer retrieval and generation directly from document images. This raises a key question: How do image-based systems compare to established text-based methods? We introduce IRPAPERS, a benchmark of 3,230 pages from 166 scientific papers, with both an image and an OCR transcription for each page. Using 180 needle-in-the-haystack questions, we compare image- and text-based retrieval and question answering systems. Text retrieval using Arctic 2.0 embeddings, BM25, and hybrid text search achieved 46% Recall@1, 78% Recall@5, and 91% Recall@20, while image-based retrieval reaches 43%, 78%, and 93%, respectively. The two modalities exhibit complementary failures, enabling multimodal hybrid search to outperform either alone, achieving 49% Recall@1, 81% Recall@5, and 95% Recall@20. We further evaluate efficiency-performance tradeoffs with MUVERA and assess multiple multi-vector image embedding models. Among closed-source models, Cohere Embed v4 page image embeddings outperform Voyage 3 Large text embeddings and all tested open-source models, achieving 58% Recall@1, 87% Recall@5, and 97% Recall@20. For question answering, text-based RAG systems achieved higher ground-truth alignment than image-based systems (0.82 vs. 0.71), and both benefit substantially from increased retrieval depth, with multi-document retrieval outperforming oracle single-document retrieval. We analyze the complementary limitations of unimodal text and image representations and identify question types that require one modality over the other. The IRPAPERS dataset and all experimental code are publicly available.</description>

      <title>DesignAsCode: Bridging Structural Editability and Visual Fidelity in Graphic Design Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphic design generation demands a delicate balance between high visual fidelity and fine-grained structural editability. However, existing approaches typically bifurcate into either non-editable raster image synthesis or abstract layout generation devoid of visual content. Recent combinations of these two approaches attempt to bridge this gap but often suffer from rigid composition schemas and unresolvable visual dissonances (e.g., text-background conflicts) due to their inexpressive representation and open-loop nature. To address these challenges, we propose DesignAsCode, a novel framework that reimagines graphic design as a programmatic synthesis task using HTML/CSS. Specifically, we introduce a Plan-Implement-Reflect pipeline, incorporating a Semantic Planner to construct dynamic, variable-depth element hierarchies and a Visual-Aware Reflection mechanism that iteratively optimizes the code to rectify rendering artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DesignAsCode significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both structural validity and aesthetic quality. Furthermore, our code-native representation unlocks advanced capabilities, including automatic layout retargeting, complex document generation (e.g., resumes), and CSS-based animation.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Network Architectures for Electrocardiogram Classification: A Comprehensive Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rising prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, electrocardiograms (ECG) remain essential for the non-invasive detection of cardiac abnormalities. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of deep neural network architectures for automated arrhythmia classification, integrating temporal modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble strategies. To address data scarcity in minority classes, the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset was augmented using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We developed and compared four distinct architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), CNN combined with Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM), CNN-LSTM with Attention, and 1D Residual Networks (ResNet-1D), to capture both local morphological features and long-term temporal dependencies. Performance was rigorously evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) with 95\% confidence intervals to ensure statistical robustness, while Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was employed to validate model interpretability. Experimental results indicate that the CNN-LSTM model achieved the optimal stand-alone balance between sensitivity and specificity, yielding an F1-score of 0.951. Conversely, the CNN-LSTM-Attention and ResNet-1D models exhibited higher sensitivity to class imbalance. To mitigate this, a dynamic ensemble fusion strategy was introduced; specifically, the Top2-Weighted ensemble achieved the highest overall performance with an F1-score of 0.958. These findings demonstrate that leveraging complementary deep architectures significantly enhances classification reliability, providing a robust and interpretable foundation for intelligent arrhythmia detection systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral Homogenization of the Radiative Transfer Equation via Low-Rank Tensor Train Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative transfer in absorbing-scattering media requires solving a transport equation across a spectral domain with 10^5 - 10^6 molecular absorption lines. Line-by-line (LBL) computation is prohibitively expensive, while existing approximations sacrifice spectral fidelity. We show that the Young-measure homogenization framework produces solution tensors I that admit low-rank tensor-train (TT) decompositions whose bond dimensions remain bounded as the spectral resolution Ns increases. Using molecular line parameters from the HITRAN database for H2O and CO2, we demonstrate that: (i) the TT rank saturates at r = 8 (at tolerance e = 10^-6) from Ns = 16 to 4096, independent of single-scattering albedo, Henyey-Greenstein asymmetry, temperature, and pressure; (ii) quantized tensor-train (QTT) representations achieve sub-linear storage scaling; (iii) in a controlled comparison using identical opacity data and transport solver, the homogenized approach achieves over an order of magnitude lower L2 error than the correlated-k distribution at equal cost; and (iv) for atomic plasma opacity (aluminum at 60 eV, TOPS database), the TT rank saturates at r = 15 with fundamentally different spectral structure (bound-bound and bound-free transitions spanning 12 decades of dynamic range), confirming that rank boundedness is a property of the transport equation rather than any particular opacity source. These results establish that the spectral complexity of radiative transfer has a finite effective rank exploitable by tensor decomposition, complementing the spatial-angular compression achieved by existing TT and dynamical low-rank approaches.</description>

      <title>Clever Materials: When Models Identify Good Materials for the Wrong Reasons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning can accelerate materials discovery. Models perform impressively on many benchmarks. However, strong benchmark performance does not imply that a model learned chemistry. I test a concrete alternative hypothesis: that property prediction can be driven by bibliographic confounding. Across five tasks spanning MOFs (thermal and solvent stability), perovskite solar cells (efficiency), batteries (capacity), and TADF emitters (emission wavelength), models trained on standard chemical descriptors predict author, journal, and publication year well above chance. When these predicted metadata ("bibliographic fingerprints") are used as the sole input to a second model, performance is sometimes competitive with conventional descriptor-based predictors. These results show that many datasets do not rule out non-chemical explanations of success. Progress requires routine falsification tests (e.g., group/time splits and metadata ablations), datasets designed to resist spurious correlations, and explicit separation of two goals: predictive utility versus evidence of chemical understanding.</description>

      <title>Nested Training for Mutual Adaptation in Human-AI Teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutual adaptation is a central challenge in human--AI teaming, as humans naturally adjust their strategies in response to a robot's policy. Existing approaches aim to improve diversity in training partners to approximate human behavior, but these partners are static and fail to capture adaptive behavior of humans. Exposing robots to adaptive behaviors is critical, yet when both agents learn simultaneously in a multi-agent setting, they often converge to opaque implicit coordination strategies that only work with the agents they were co-trained with. Such agents fail to generalize when paired with new partners. In order to capture the adaptive behavior of humans, we model the human-robot teaming scenario as an Interactive Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (I-POMDP), explicitly modeling human adaptation as part of the state. We propose a nested training regime to approximately learn the solution to a finite-level I-POMDP. In this framework, agents at each level are trained against adaptive agents from the level below. This ensures that the ego agent is exposed to adaptive behavior during training while avoiding the emergence of implicit coordination strategies, since the training partners are not themselves learning. We train our method in a multi-episode, required cooperation setup in the Overcooked domain, comparing it against several baseline agents designed for human-robot teaming. We evaluate the performance of our agent when paired with adaptive partners that were not seen during training. Our results demonstrate that our agent not only achieves higher task performance with these adaptive partners but also exhibits significantly greater adaptability during team interactions.</description>

      <title>GeneZip: Region-Aware Compression for Long Context DNA Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genomic sequences span billions of base pairs (bp), posing a fundamental challenge for genome-scale foundation models. Existing approaches largely sidestep this barrier by either scaling relatively small models to long contexts or relying on heavy multi-GPU parallelism. Here we introduce GeneZip, a DNA compression model that leverages a key biological prior: genomic information is highly imbalanced. Coding regions comprise only a small fraction (about 2 percent) yet are information-dense, whereas most non-coding sequence is comparatively information-sparse. GeneZip couples HNet-style dynamic routing with a region-aware compression-ratio objective, enabling adaptive allocation of representation budget across genomic regions. As a result, GeneZip learns region-aware compression and achieves 137.6x compression with only 0.31 perplexity increase. On downstream long-context benchmarks, GeneZip achieves comparable or better performance on contact map prediction, expression quantitative trait loci prediction, and enhancer-target gene prediction. By reducing effective sequence length, GeneZip unlocks simultaneous scaling of context and capacity: compared to the prior state-of-the-art model JanusDNA, it enables training models 82.6x larger at 1M-bp context, supporting a 636M-parameter GeneZip model at 1M-bp context. All experiments in this paper can be trained on a single A100 80GB GPU.</description>

      <title>AgriVariant: Variant Effect Prediction using DeepChem-Variant for Precision Breeding in Rice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting functional consequences of genetic variants in crop genes remains a critical bottleneck for precision breeding programs. We present AgriVariant, an end-to-end pipeline for variant-effect prediction in rice (Oryza sativa) that addresses the lack of crop-specific variant-interpretation tools and can be extended to any crop species with available reference genomes and gene annotations. Our approach integrates deep learning-based variant calling (DeepChem-Variant) with custom plant genomics annotation using RAP-DB gene models and database-independent deleteriousness scoring that combines the Grantham distance and the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix. We validate the pipeline through targeted mutations in stress-response genes (OsDREB2a, OsDREB1F, SKC1), demonstrating correct classification of stop-gained, missense, and synonymous variants with appropriate HIGH / MODERATE / LOW impact assignments. An exhaustive mutagenesis study of OsMT-3a analyzed all 1,509 possible single-nucleotide variants in 10 days, identifying 353 high-impact, 447 medium-impact, and 709 low-impact variants - an analysis that would have required 2-4 years using traditional wet-lab approaches. This computational framework enables breeders to prioritize variants for experimental validation across diverse crop species, reducing screening costs and accelerating development of climate-resilient crop varieties.</description>

      <title>CLUTCH: Contextualized Language model for Unlocking Text-Conditioned Hand motion modelling in the wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hands play a central role in daily life, yet modeling natural hand motions remains underexplored. Existing methods that tackle text-to-hand-motion generation or hand animation captioning rely on studio-captured datasets with limited actions and contexts, making them costly to scale to "in-the-wild" settings. Further, contemporary models and their training schemes struggle to capture animation fidelity with text-motion alignment. To address this, we (1) introduce '3D Hands in the Wild' (3D-HIW), a dataset of 32K 3D hand-motion sequences and aligned text, and (2) propose CLUTCH, an LLM-based hand animation system with two critical innovations: (a) SHIFT, a novel VQ-VAE architecture to tokenize hand motion, and (b) a geometric refinement stage to finetune the LLM. To build 3D-HIW, we propose a data annotation pipeline that combines vision-language models (VLMs) and state-of-the-art 3D hand trackers, and apply it to a large corpus of egocentric action videos covering a wide range of scenarios. To fully capture motion in-the-wild, CLUTCH employs SHIFT, a part-modality decomposed VQ-VAE, which improves generalization and reconstruction fidelity. Finally, to improve animation quality, we introduce a geometric refinement stage, where CLUTCH is co-supervised with a reconstruction loss applied directly to decoded hand motion parameters. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on text-to-motion and motion-to-text tasks, establishing the first benchmark for scalable in-the-wild hand motion modelling. Code, data and models will be released.</description>

      <title>Sparse Bayesian Modeling of EEG Channel Interactions Improves P300 Brain-Computer Interface Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based P300 brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable communication without physical movement by detecting stimulus-evoked neural responses. Accurate and efficient decoding remains challenging due to high dimensionality, temporal dependence, and complex interactions across EEG channels. Most existing approaches treat channels independently or rely on black-box machine learning models, limiting interpretability and personalization. We propose a sparse Bayesian time-varying regression framework that explicitly models pairwise EEG channel interactions while performing automatic temporal feature selection. The model employs a relaxed-thresholded Gaussian process prior to induce structured sparsity in both channel-specific and interaction effects, enabling interpretable identification of task-relevant channels and channel pairs. Applied to a publicly available P300 speller dataset of 55 participants, the proposed method achieves a median character-level accuracy of 100\% using all stimulus sequences and attains the highest overall decoding performance among competing statistical and deep learning approaches. Incorporating channel interactions yields subgroup-specific gains of up to 7\% in character-level accuracy, particularly among participants who abstained from alcohol (up to 18\% improvement). Importantly, the proposed method improves median BCI-Utility by approximately 10\% at its optimal operating point, achieving peak throughput after only seven stimulus sequences. These results demonstrate that explicitly modeling structured EEG channel interactions within a principled Bayesian framework enhances predictive accuracy, improves user-centric throughput, and supports personalization in P300 BCI systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Flow Distributions via Projection-Constrained Diffusion on Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a generative modeling framework for synthesizing physically feasible two-dimensional incompressible flows under arbitrary obstacle geometries and boundary conditions. Whereas existing diffusion-based flow generators either ignore physical constraints, impose soft penalties that do not guarantee feasibility, or specialize to fixed geometries, our approach integrates three complementary components: (1) a boundary-conditioned diffusion model operating on velocity fields; (2) a physics-informed training objective incorporating a divergence penalty; and (3) a projection-constrained reverse diffusion process that enforces exact incompressibility through a geometry-aware Helmholtz-Hodge operator. We derive the method as a discrete approximation to constrained Langevin sampling on the manifold of divergence-free vector fields, providing a connection between modern diffusion models and geometric constraint enforcement in incompressible flow spaces. Experiments on analytic Navier-Stokes data and obstacle-bounded flow configurations demonstrate significantly improved divergence, spectral accuracy, vorticity statistics, and boundary consistency relative to unconstrained, projection-only, and penalty-only baselines. Our formulation unifies soft and hard physical structure within diffusion models and provides a foundation for generative modeling of incompressible fields in robotics, graphics, and scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Solving and learning advective multiscale Darcian dynamics with the Neural Basis Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-governed models are increasingly paired with machine learning for accelerated predictions, yet most "physics--informed" formulations treat the governing equations as a penalty loss whose scale and meaning are set by heuristic balancing. This blurs operator structure, thereby confounding solution approximation error with governing-equation enforcement error and making the solving and learning progress hard to interpret and control. Here we introduce the Neural Basis Method, a projection-based formulation that couples a predefined, physics-conforming neural basis space with an operator-induced residual metric to obtain a well-conditioned deterministic minimization. Stability and reliability then hinge on this metric: the residual is not merely an optimization objective but a computable certificate tied to approximation and enforcement, remaining stable under basis enrichment and yielding reduced coordinates that are learnable across parametric instances. We use advective multiscale Darcian dynamics as a concrete demonstration of this broader point. Our method produce accurate and robust solutions in single solves and enable fast and effective parametric inference with operator learning.</description>

      <title>Topological Exploration of High-Dimensional Empirical Risk Landscapes: general approach, and applications to phase retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the landscape of empirical risk minimization for high-dimensional Gaussian single-index models (generalized linear models). The objective is to recover an unknown signal $\boldsymbol{\theta}^\star \in \mathbb{R}^d$ (where $d \gg 1$) from a loss function $\hat{R}(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ that depends on pairs of labels $(\mathbf{x}_i \cdot \boldsymbol{\theta}, \mathbf{x}_i \cdot \boldsymbol{\theta}^\star)_{i=1}^n$, with $\mathbf{x}_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I_d)$, in the proportional asymptotic regime $n \asymp d$. Using the Kac-Rice formula, we analyze different complexities of the landscape -- defined as the expected number of critical points -- corresponding to various types of critical points, including local minima. We first show that some variational formulas previously established in the literature for these complexities can be drastically simplified, reducing to explicit variational problems over a finite number of scalar parameters that we can efficiently solve numerically. Our framework also provides detailed predictions for properties of the critical points, including the spectral properties of the Hessian and the joint distribution of labels. We apply our analysis to the real phase retrieval problem for which we derive complete topological phase diagrams of the loss landscape, characterizing notably BBP-type transitions where the Hessian at local minima (as predicted by the Kac-Rice formula) becomes unstable in the direction of the signal. We test the predictive power of our analysis to characterize gradient flow dynamics, finding excellent agreement with finite-size simulations of local optimization algorithms, and capturing fine-grained details such as the empirical distribution of labels. Overall, our results open new avenues for the asymptotic study of loss landscapes and topological trivialization phenomena in high-dimensional statistical models.</description>

      <title>Market Games for Generative Models: Equilibria, Welfare, and Strategic Entry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative model ecosystems increasingly operate as competitive multi-platform markets, where platforms strategically select models from a shared pool and users with heterogeneous preferences choose among them. Understanding how platforms interact, when market equilibria exist, how outcomes are shaped by model-providers, platforms, and user behavior, and how social welfare is affected is critical for fostering a beneficial market environment. In this paper, we formalize a three-layer model-platform-user market game and identify conditions for the existence of pure Nash equilibrium. Our analysis shows that market structure, whether platforms converge on similar models or differentiate by selecting distinct ones, depends not only on models' global average performance but also on their localized attraction to user groups. We further examine welfare outcomes and show that expanding the model pool does not necessarily increase user welfare or market diversity. Finally, we design novel best-response training schemes that allow model providers to strategically introduce new models into competitive markets.</description>

Abstract: Skin cancer can be life-threatening if not diagnosed early, a prevalent yet preventable disease. Globally, skin cancer is perceived among the finest prevailing cancers and millions of people are diagnosed each year. For the allotment of benign and malignant skin spots, an area of critical importance in dermatological diagnostics, the application of two prominent deep learning models, VGG16 and DenseNet201 are investigated by this paper. We evaluate these CNN architectures for their efficacy in differentiating benign from malignant skin lesions leveraging enhancements in deep learning enforced to skin cancer spotting. Our objective is to assess model accuracy and computational efficiency, offering insights into how these models could assist in early detection, diagnosis, and streamlined workflows in dermatology. We used two deep learning methods DenseNet201 and VGG16 model on a binary class dataset containing 3297 images. The best result with an accuracy of 93.79% achieved by DenseNet201. All images were resized to 224x224 by rescaling. Although both models provide excellent accuracy, there is still some room for improvement. In future using new datasets, we tend to improve our work by achieving great accuracy.</description>

      <title>VQPP: Video Query Performance Prediction Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Query performance prediction (QPP) is an important and actively studied information retrieval task, having various applications, such as query reformulation, query expansion, and retrieval system selection, among many others. The task has been primarily studied in the context of text and image retrieval, whereas QPP for content-based video retrieval (CBVR) remains largely underexplored. To this end, we propose the first benchmark for video query performance prediction (VQPP), comprising two text-to-video retrieval datasets and two CBVR systems, respectively. VQPP contains a total of 56K text queries and 51K videos, and comes with official training, validation and test splits, fostering direct comparisons and reproducible results. We explore multiple pre-retrieval and post-retrieval performance predictors, creating a representative benchmark for future exploration of QPP in the video domain. Our results show that pre-retrieval predictors obtain competitive performance, enabling applications before performing the retrieval step. We also demonstrate the applicability of VQPP by employing the best performing pre-retrieval predictor as reward model for training a large language model (LLM) on the query reformulation task via direct preference optimization (DPO). We release our benchmark and code at https://github.com/AdrianLutu/VQPP.</description>

Abstract: Language models exhibit fundamental limitations -- hallucination, brittleness, and lack of formal grounding -- that are particularly problematic in high-stakes specialist fields requiring verifiable reasoning. I investigate whether formal domain ontologies can enhance language model reliability through retrieval-augmented generation. Using mathematics as proof of concept, I implement a neuro-symbolic pipeline leveraging the OpenMath ontology with hybrid retrieval and cross-encoder reranking to inject relevant definitions into model prompts. Evaluation on the MATH benchmark with three open-source models reveals that ontology-guided context improves performance when retrieval quality is high, but irrelevant context actively degrades it -- highlighting both the promise and challenges of neuro-symbolic approaches.</description>

Abstract: We study the estimation of time-homogeneous drift functions in multivariate stochastic differential equations with known diffusion coefficient, from multiple trajectories observed at high frequency over a fixed time horizon. We formulate drift estimation as a denoising problem conditional on previous observations, and propose an estimator of the drift function which is a by-product of training a conditional diffusion model capable of simulating new trajectories dynamically. Across different drift classes, the proposed estimator was found to match classical methods in low dimensions and remained consistently competitive in higher dimensions, with gains that cannot be attributed to architectural design choices alone.</description>

      <title>TFL: Targeted Bit-Flip Attack on Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety and security critical applications, raising concerns about their robustness to model parameter fault injection attacks. Recent studies have shown that bit-flip attacks (BFAs), which exploit computer main memory (i.e., DRAM) vulnerabilities to flip a small number of bits in model weights, can severely disrupt LLM behavior. However, existing BFA on LLM largely induce un-targeted failure or general performance degradation, offering limited control over manipulating specific or targeted outputs. In this paper, we present TFL, a novel targeted bit-flip attack framework that enables precise manipulation of LLM outputs for selected prompts while maintaining almost no or minor degradation on unrelated inputs. Within our TFL framework, we propose a novel keyword-focused attack loss to promote attacker-specified target tokens in generative outputs, together with an auxiliary utility score that balances attack effectiveness against collateral performance impact on benign data. We evaluate TFL on multiple LLMs (Qwen, DeepSeek, Llama) and benchmarks (DROP, GSM8K, and TriviaQA). The experiments show that TFL achieves successful targeted LLM output manipulations with less than 50 bit flips and significantly reduced effect on unrelated queries compared to prior BFA approaches. This demonstrates the effectiveness of TFL and positions it as a new class of stealthy and targeted LLM model attack.</description>

      <title>TopoGate: Quality-Aware Topology-Stabilized Gated Fusion for Longitudinal Low-Dose CT New-Lesion Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Longitudinal low-dose CT follow-ups vary in noise, reconstruction kernels, and registration quality. These differences destabilize subtraction images and can trigger false new lesion alarms. We present TopoGate, a lightweight model that combines the follow-up appearance view with the subtraction view and controls their influence through a learned, quality-aware gate. The gate is driven by three case-specific signals: CT appearance quality, registration consistency, and stability of anatomical topology measured with topological metrics. On the NLST--New-Lesion--LongCT cohort comprising 152 pairs from 122 patients, TopoGate improves discrimination and calibration over single-view baselines, achieving an area under the ROC curve of 0.65 with a standard deviation of 0.05 and a Brier score of 0.14. Removing corrupted or low-quality pairs, identified by the quality scores, further increases the area under the ROC curve from 0.62 to 0.68 and reduces the Brier score from 0.14 to 0.12. The gate responds predictably to degradation, placing more weight on appearance when noise grows, which mirrors radiologist practice. The approach is simple, interpretable, and practical for reliable longitudinal LDCT triage.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Fine-Grained Knowledge Capabilities of Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made substantial progress across a wide range of visual question answering benchmarks, spanning visual reasoning, document understanding, and multimodal dialogue. These improvements are evident in a wide range of VLMs built on a variety of base models, alignment architectures, and training data. However, recent works show that these models trail behind in traditional image classification benchmarks, which test fine-grained visual knowledge. We test a large number of recent VLMs on fine-grained classification benchmarks and identify potential factors in the disconnect between fine-grained knowledge and other vision benchmarks. Through a series of ablation experiments, we find that using a better LLM improves all benchmark scores equally, while a better vision encoder disproportionately improves fine-grained classification performance. Furthermore, we find that the pretraining stage is also vital to fine-grained performance, particularly when the language model weights are unfrozen during pretraining. These insights pave the way for enhancing fine-grained visual understanding and vision-centric capabilities in VLMs.</description>

      <title>Interactive Learning of Single-Index Models via Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a cornerstone algorithm for high-dimensional optimization, renowned for its empirical successes. Recent theoretical advances have provided a deep understanding of how SGD enables feature learning in high-dimensional nonlinear models, most notably the \textit{single-index model} with i.i.d. data. In this work, we study the sequential learning problem for single-index models, also known as generalized linear bandits or ridge bandits, where SGD is a simple and natural solution, yet its learning dynamics remain largely unexplored. We show that, similar to the optimal interactive learner, SGD undergoes a distinct ``burn-in'' phase before entering the ``learning'' phase in this setting. Moreover, with an appropriately chosen learning rate schedule, a single SGD procedure simultaneously achieves near-optimal (or best-known) sample complexity and regret guarantees across both phases, for a broad class of link functions. Our results demonstrate that SGD remains highly competitive for learning single-index models under adaptive data.</description>

      <title>Understanding Unreliability of Steering Vectors in Language Models: Geometric Predictors and the Limits of Linear Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Steering vectors are a lightweight method for controlling language model behavior by adding a learned bias to the activations at inference time. Although effective on average, steering effect sizes vary across samples and are unreliable for many target behaviors. In my thesis, I investigate why steering reliability differs across behaviors and how it is impacted by steering vector training data. First, I find that higher cosine similarity between training activation differences predicts more reliable steering. Second, I observe that behavior datasets where positive and negative activations are better separated along the steering direction are more reliably steerable. Finally, steering vectors trained on different prompt variations are directionally distinct, yet perform similarly well and exhibit correlated efficacy across datasets. My findings suggest that steering vectors are unreliable when the latent target behavior representation is not effectively approximated by the linear steering direction. Taken together, these insights offer a practical diagnostic for steering unreliability and motivate the development of more robust steering methods that explicitly account for non-linear latent behavior representations.</description>

      <title>Learning from Biased and Costly Data Sources: Minimax-optimal Data Collection under a Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data collection is a critical component of modern statistical and machine learning pipelines, particularly when data must be gathered from multiple heterogeneous sources to study a target population of interest. In many use cases, such as medical studies or political polling, different sources incur different sampling costs. Observations often have associated group identities (for example, health markers, demographics, or political affiliations) and the relative composition of these groups may differ substantially, both among the source populations and between sources and target population.
  In this work, we study multi-source data collection under a fixed budget, focusing on the estimation of population means and group-conditional means. We show that naive data collection strategies (e.g. attempting to "match" the target distribution) or relying on standard estimators (e.g. sample mean) can be highly suboptimal. Instead, we develop a sampling plan which maximizes the effective sample size: the total sample size divided by $D_{\chi^2}(q\mid\mid\overline{p}) + 1$, where $q$ is the target distribution, $\overline{p}$ is the aggregated source distribution, and $D_{\chi^2}$ is the $\chi^2$-divergence. We pair this sampling plan with a classical post-stratification estimator and upper bound its risk. We provide matching lower bounds, establishing that our approach achieves the budgeted minimax optimal risk. Our techniques also extend to prediction problems when minimizing the excess risk, providing a principled approach to multi-source learning with costly and heterogeneous data sources.</description>

      <title>Interactions that reshape the interfaces of the interacting parties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polynomial functors model systems with interfaces: each polynomial specifies the outputs a system can produce and, for each output, the inputs it accepts. The bicategory $\mathbb{O}\mathbf{rg}$ of dynamic organizations \cite{spivak2021learners} gives a notion of state-driven interaction patterns that evolves over time, but each system's interface remains fixed throughout the interaction. Yet in many systems, the outputs sent and inputs received can reshape the interface itself: a cell differentiating in response to chemical signals gains or loses receptors; a sensor damaged by its input loses a channel; a neural network may grow its output resolution during training.
  Here we introduce *polynomial trees*, elements of the terminal $(u\triangleleft u)$-coalgebra where $u$ is the polynomial associated to a universe of sets, to model such systems: a polynomial tree is a coinductive tree whose nodes carry polynomials, and in which each round of interaction -- an output chosen and an input received -- determines a child tree, hence the next interface. We construct a monoidal closed category $\mathbf{PolyTr}$ of polynomial trees, with coinductively-defined morphisms, tensor product, and internal hom. We then build a bicategory $\mathbb{O}\mathbf{rgTr}$ generalizing $\mathbb{O}\mathbf{rg}$, whose hom-categories parametrize morphisms by state sets with coinductive action-and-update data. We provide a locally fully faithful functor $\mathbb{O}\mathbf{rg}\to\mathbb{O}\mathbf{rgTr}$ via constant trees, those for which the interfaces do not change through time. We illustrate the generalization by suggesting a notion of progressive generative adversarial networks, where gradient feedback determines when the image-generation interface grows to a higher resolution.</description>

      <title>Latent Diffeomorphic Co-Design of End-Effectors for Deformable and Fragile Object Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulating deformable and fragile objects remains a fundamental challenge in robotics due to complex contact dynamics and strict requirements on object integrity. Existing approaches typically optimize either end-effector design or control strategies in isolation, limiting achievable performance. In this work, we present the first co-design framework that jointly optimizes end-effector morphology and manipulation control for deformable and fragile object manipulation. We introduce (1) a latent diffeomorphic shape parameterization enabling expressive yet tractable end-effector geometry optimization, (2) a stress-aware bi-level co-design pipeline coupling morphology and control optimization, and (3) a privileged-to-pointcloud policy distillation scheme for zero-shot real-world deployment. We evaluate our approach on challenging food manipulation tasks, including grasping and pushing jelly and scooping fillets. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>ZACH-ViT: Regime-Dependent Inductive Bias in Compact Vision Transformers for Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers rely on positional embeddings and class tokens that encode fixed spatial priors. While effective for natural images, these priors may hinder generalization when spatial layout is weakly informative or inconsistent, a frequent condition in medical imaging and edge-deployed clinical systems. We introduce ZACH-ViT (Zero-token Adaptive Compact Hierarchical Vision Transformer), a compact Vision Transformer that removes both positional embeddings and the [CLS] token, achieving permutation invariance through global average pooling over patch representations. The term "Zero-token" specifically refers to removing the dedicated [CLS] aggregation token and positional embeddings; patch tokens remain unchanged and are processed normally. Adaptive residual projections preserve training stability in compact configurations while maintaining a strict parameter budget.
  Evaluation is performed across seven MedMNIST datasets spanning binary and multi-class tasks under a strict few-shot protocol (50 samples per class, fixed hyperparameters, five random seeds). The empirical analysis demonstrates regime-dependent behavior: ZACH-ViT (0.25M parameters, trained from scratch) achieves its strongest advantage on BloodMNIST and remains competitive with TransMIL on PathMNIST, while its relative advantage decreases on datasets with strong anatomical priors (OCTMNIST, OrganAMNIST), consistent with the architectural hypothesis. These findings support the view that aligning architectural inductive bias with data structure can be more important than pursuing universal benchmark dominance. Despite its minimal size and lack of pretraining, ZACH-ViT achieves competitive performance while maintaining sub-second inference times, supporting deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. Code and models are available at https://github.com/Bluesman79/ZACH-ViT.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning without Synchrony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean-field reinforcement learning (MF-RL) scales multi-agent RL to large populations by reducing each agent's dependence on others to a single summary statistic -- the mean action. However, this reduction requires every agent to act at every time step; when some agents are idle, the mean action is simply undefined. Addressing asynchrony therefore requires a different summary statistic -- one that remains defined regardless of which agents act. The population distribution $\mu \in \Delta(\mathcal{O})$ -- the fraction of agents at each observation -- satisfies this requirement: its dimension is independent of $N$, and under exchangeability it fully determines each agent's reward and transition. Existing MF-RL theory, however, is built on the mean action and does not extend to $\mu$. We therefore construct the Temporal Mean Field (TMF) framework around the population distribution $\mu$ from scratch, covering the full spectrum from fully synchronous to purely sequential decision-making within a single theory. We prove existence and uniqueness of TMF equilibria, establish an $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ finite-population approximation bound that holds regardless of how many agents act per step, and prove convergence of a policy gradient algorithm (TMF-PG) to the unique equilibrium. Experiments on a resource selection game and a dynamic queueing game confirm that TMF-PG achieves near-identical performance whether one agent or all $N$ act per step, with approximation error decaying at the predicted $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ rate.</description>

      <title>CityGuard: Graph-Aware Private Descriptors for Bias-Resilient Identity Search Across Urban Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: City-scale person re-identification across distributed cameras must handle severe appearance changes from viewpoint, occlusion, and domain shift while complying with data protection rules that prevent sharing raw imagery. We introduce CityGuard, a topology-aware transformer for privacy-preserving identity retrieval in decentralized surveillance. The framework integrates three components. A dispersion-adaptive metric learner adjusts instance-level margins according to feature spread, increasing intra-class compactness. Spatially conditioned attention injects coarse geometry, such as GPS or deployment floor plans, into graph-based self-attention to enable projectively consistent cross-view alignment using only coarse geometric priors without requiring survey-grade calibration. Differentially private embedding maps are coupled with compact approximate indexes to support secure and cost-efficient deployment. Together these designs produce descriptors robust to viewpoint variation, occlusion, and domain shifts, and they enable a tunable balance between privacy and utility under rigorous differential-privacy accounting. Experiments on Market-1501 and additional public benchmarks, complemented by database-scale retrieval studies, show consistent gains in retrieval precision and query throughput over strong baselines, confirming the practicality of the framework for privacy-critical urban identity matching.</description>

      <title>On the Generalization and Robustness in Conditional Value-at-Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is a widely used risk-sensitive objective for learning under rare but high-impact losses, yet its statistical behavior under heavy-tailed data remains poorly understood. Unlike expectation-based risk, CVaR depends on an endogenous, data-dependent quantile, which couples tail averaging with threshold estimation and fundamentally alters both generalization and robustness properties. In this work, we develop a learning-theoretic analysis of CVaR-based empirical risk minimization under heavy-tailed and contaminated data. We establish sharp, high-probability generalization and excess risk bounds under minimal moment assumptions, covering fixed hypotheses, finite and infinite classes, and extending to $\beta$-mixing dependent data; we further show that these rates are minimax optimal. To capture the intrinsic quantile sensitivity of CVaR, we derive a uniform Bahadur-Kiefer type expansion that isolates a threshold-driven error term absent in mean-risk ERM and essential in heavy-tailed regimes. We complement these results with robustness guarantees by proposing a truncated median-of-means CVaR estimator that achieves optimal rates under adversarial contamination. Finally, we show that CVaR decisions themselves can be intrinsically unstable under heavy tails, establishing a fundamental limitation on decision robustness even when the population optimum is well separated. Together, our results provide a principled characterization of when CVaR learning generalizes and is robust, and when instability is unavoidable due to tail scarcity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate soil moisture (SM) estimation is critical for precision agriculture, water resources management and climate monitoring. Yet, existing satellite SM products are too coarse (&gt;1km) for farm-level applications. We present a high-resolution (10m) SM estimation framework for vegetated areas across Europe, combining Sentinel-1 SAR, Sentinel-2 optical imagery and ERA-5 reanalysis data through machine learning. Using 113 International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) stations spanning diverse vegetated areas, we compare modality combinations with temporal parameterizations, using spatial cross-validation, to ensure geographic generalization. We also evaluate whether foundation model embeddings from IBM-NASA's Prithvi model improve upon traditional hand-crafted spectral features. Results demonstrate that hybrid temporal matching - Sentinel-2 current-day acquisitions with Sentinel-1 descending orbit - achieves R^2=0.514, with 10-day ERA5 lookback window improving performance to R^2=0.518. Foundation model (Prithvi) embeddings provide negligible improvement over hand-crafted features (R^2=0.515 vs. 0.514), indicating traditional feature engineering remains highly competitive for sparse-data regression tasks. Our findings suggest that domain-specific spectral indices combined with tree-based ensemble methods offer a practical and computationally efficient solution for operational pan-European field-scale soil moisture monitoring.</description>

      <title>DohaScript: A Large-Scale Multi-Writer Dataset for Continuous Handwritten Hindi Text</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite having hundreds of millions of speakers, handwritten Devanagari text remains severely underrepresented in publicly available benchmark datasets. Existing resources are limited in scale, focus primarily on isolated characters or short words, and lack controlled lexical content and writer level diversity, which restricts their utility for modern data driven handwriting analysis. As a result, they fail to capture the continuous, fused, and structurally complex nature of Devanagari handwriting, where characters are connected through a shared shirorekha (horizontal headline) and exhibit rich ligature formations. We introduce DohaScript, a large scale, multi writer dataset of handwritten Hindi text collected from 531 unique contributors. The dataset is designed as a parallel stylistic corpus, in which all writers transcribe the same fixed set of six traditional Hindi dohas (couplets). This controlled design enables systematic analysis of writer specific variation independent of linguistic content, and supports tasks such as handwriting recognition, writer identification, style analysis, and generative modeling. The dataset is accompanied by non identifiable demographic metadata, rigorous quality curation based on objective sharpness and resolution criteria, and page level layout difficulty annotations that facilitate stratified benchmarking. Baseline experiments demonstrate clear quality separation and strong generalization to unseen writers, highlighting the dataset's reliability and practical value. DohaScript is intended to serve as a standardized and reproducible benchmark for advancing research on continuous handwritten Devanagari text in low resource script settings.</description>

      <title>Interacting safely with cyclists using Hamilton-Jacobi reachability and reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for enabling autonomous vehicles to interact with cyclists in a manner that balances safety and optimality. The approach integrates Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis with deep Q-learning to jointly address safety guarantees and time-efficient navigation. A value function is computed as the solution to a time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman inequality, providing a quantitative measure of safety for each system state. This safety metric is incorporated as a structured reward signal within a reinforcement learning framework. The method further models the cyclist's latent response to the vehicle, allowing disturbance inputs to reflect human comfort and behavioral adaptation. The proposed framework is evaluated through simulation and comparison with human driving behavior and an existing state-of-the-art method.</description>

      <title>MeanVoiceFlow: One-step Nonparallel Voice Conversion with Mean Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In voice conversion (VC) applications, diffusion and flow-matching models have exhibited exceptional speech quality and speaker similarity performances. However, they are limited by slow conversion owing to their iterative inference. Consequently, we propose MeanVoiceFlow, a novel one-step nonparallel VC model based on mean flows, which can be trained from scratch without requiring pretraining or distillation. Unlike conventional flow matching that uses instantaneous velocity, mean flows employ average velocity to more accurately compute the time integral along the inference path in a single step. However, training the average velocity requires its derivative to compute the target velocity, which can cause instability. Therefore, we introduce a structural margin reconstruction loss as a zero-input constraint, which moderately regularizes the input-output behavior of the model without harmful statistical averaging. Furthermore, we propose conditional diffused-input training in which a mixture of noise and source data is used as input to the model during both training and inference. This enables the model to effectively leverage source information while maintaining consistency between training and inference. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of these techniques and demonstrate that MeanVoiceFlow achieves performance comparable to that of previous multi-step and distillation-based models, even when trained from scratch. Audio samples are available at https://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/people/kaneko.takuhiro/projects/meanvoiceflow/.</description>

      <title>RamanSeg: Interpretability-driven Deep Learning on Raman Spectra for Cancer Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Histopathology, the current gold standard for cancer diagnosis, involves the manual examination of tissue samples after chemical staining, a time-consuming process requiring expert analysis. Raman spectroscopy is an alternative, stain-free method of extracting information from samples. Using nnU-Net, we trained a segmentation model on a novel dataset of spatial Raman spectra aligned with tumour annotations, achieving a mean foreground Dice score of 80.9%, surpassing previous work. Furthermore, we propose a novel, interpretable, prototype-based architecture called RamanSeg. RamanSeg classifies pixels based on discovered regions of the training set, generating a segmentation mask. Two variants of RamanSeg allow a trade-off between interpretability and performance: one with prototype projection and another projection-free version. The projection-free RamanSeg outperformed a U-Net baseline with a mean foreground Dice score of 67.3%, offering a meaningful improvement over a black-box training approach.</description>

      <title>Agentic Adversarial QA for Improving Domain-Specific LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite extensive pretraining on broad internet corpora, often struggle to adapt effectively to specialized domains. There is growing interest in fine-tuning these models for such domains; however, progress is constrained by the scarcity and limited coverage of high-quality, task-relevant data. To address this, synthetic data generation methods such as paraphrasing or knowledge extraction are commonly applied. Although these approaches excel at factual recall and conceptual knowledge, they suffer from two critical shortcomings: (i) they provide minimal support for interpretive reasoning capabilities in these specialized domains, and (ii) they often produce synthetic corpora that are excessively large and redundant, resulting in poor sample efficiency. To overcome these gaps, we propose an adversarial question-generation framework that produces a compact set of semantically challenging questions. These questions are constructed by comparing the outputs of the model to be adapted and a robust expert model grounded in reference documents, using an iterative, feedback-driven process designed to reveal and address comprehension gaps. Evaluation on specialized subsets of the LegalBench corpus demonstrates that our method achieves greater accuracy with substantially fewer synthetic samples.</description>

      <title>BONNI: Gradient-Informed Bayesian and Interior Point Optimization for Efficient Inverse Design in Nanophotonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse design, particularly geometric shape optimization, provides a systematic approach for developing high-performance nanophotonic devices. While numerous optimization algorithms exist, previous global approaches exhibit slow convergence and conversely local search strategies frequently become trapped in local optima. To address the limitations inherent to both local and global approaches, we introduce BONNI: Bayesian optimization through neural network ensemble surrogates with interior point optimization. It augments global optimization with an efficient incorporation of gradient information to determine optimal sampling points. This capability allows BONNI to circumvent the local optima found in many nanophotonic applications, while capitalizing on the efficiency of gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate BONNI's capabilities in the design of a distributed Bragg reflector as well as a dual-layer grating coupler through an exhaustive comparison against other optimization algorithms commonly used in literature. Using BONNI, we were able to design a 10-layer distributed Bragg reflector with only 4.5% mean spectral error, compared to the previously reported results of 7.8% error with 16 layers. Further designs of a broadband waveguide taper and photonic crystal waveguide transition validate the capabilities of BONNI.</description>

Abstract: Hardware heterogeneity across diverse user devices poses new challenges for beam-based communication in 5G and beyond. This heterogeneity limits the applicability of machine learning (ML)-based algorithms. This article highlights the critical need to treat hardware heterogeneity as a first-class design concern in ML-aided beam management. We analyze key failure modes in the presence of heterogeneity and present case studies demonstrating their performance impact. Finally, we discuss potential strategies to improve generalization in beam management.</description>

      <title>Box Thirding: Anytime Best Arm Identification under Insufficient Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Box Thirding (B3), a flexible and efficient algorithm for Best Arm Identification (BAI) under fixed-budget constraints. It is designed for both anytime BAI and scenarios with large N, where the number of arms is too large for exhaustive evaluation within a limited budget T. The algorithm employs an iterative ternary comparison: in each iteration, three arms are compared--the best-performing arm is explored further, the median is deferred for future comparisons, and the weakest is discarded. Even without prior knowledge of T, B3 achieves an epsilon-best arm misidentification probability comparable to Successive Halving (SH), which requires T as a predefined parameter, applied to a randomly selected subset of c0 arms that fit within the budget. Empirical results show that B3 outperforms existing methods under limited-budget constraints in terms of simple regret, as demonstrated on the New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest dataset.</description>

      <title>SOMtime the World Ain$'$t Fair: Violating Fairness Using Self-Organizing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised representations are widely assumed to be neutral with respect to sensitive attributes when those attributes are withheld from training. We show that this assumption is false. Using SOMtime, a topology-preserving representation method based on high-capacity Self-Organizing Maps, we demonstrate that sensitive attributes such as age and income emerge as dominant latent axes in purely unsupervised embeddings, even when explicitly excluded from the input. On two large-scale real-world datasets (the World Values Survey across five countries and the Census-Income dataset), SOMtime recovers monotonic orderings aligned with withheld sensitive attributes, achieving Spearman correlations of up to 0.85, whereas PCA and UMAP typically remain below 0.23 (with a single exception reaching 0.31), and against t-SNE and autoencoders which achieve at most 0.34. Furthermore, unsupervised segmentation of SOMtime embeddings produces demographically skewed clusters, demonstrating downstream fairness risks without any supervised task. These findings establish that \textit{fairness through unawareness} fails at the representation level for ordinal sensitive attributes and that fairness auditing must extend to unsupervised components of machine learning pipelines.

      <title>Machine-learning force-field models for dynamical simulations of metallic magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent advances in machine learning (ML) force-field methods for Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) simulations of itinerant electron magnets, focusing on scalability and transferability. Built on the principle of locality, a deep neural network model is developed to efficiently and accurately predict the electron-mediated forces governing spin dynamics. Symmetry-aware descriptors constructed through a group-theoretical approach ensure rigorous incorporation of both lattice and spin-rotation symmetries. The framework is demonstrated using the prototypical s-d exchange model widely employed in spintronics. ML-enabled large-scale simulations reveal novel nonequilibrium phenomena, including anomalous coarsening of tetrahedral spin order on the triangular lattice and the freezing of phase separation dynamics in lightly hole-doped, strong-coupling square-lattice systems. These results establish ML force-field frameworks as scalable, accurate, and versatile tools for modeling nonequilibrium spin dynamics in itinerant magnets.</description>

      <title>SimVLA: A Simple VLA Baseline for Robotic Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising paradigm for general-purpose robotic manipulation, leveraging large-scale pre-training to achieve strong performance. The field has rapidly evolved with additional spatial priors and diverse architectural innovations. However, these advancements are often accompanied by varying training recipes and implementation details, which can make it challenging to disentangle the precise source of empirical gains. In this work, we introduce SimVLA, a streamlined baseline designed to establish a transparent reference point for VLA research. By strictly decoupling perception from control, using a standard vision-language backbone and a lightweight action head, and standardizing critical training dynamics, we demonstrate that a minimal design can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Despite having only 0.5B parameters, SimVLA outperforms multi-billion-parameter models on standard simulation benchmarks without robot pretraining. SimVLA also reaches on-par real-robot performance compared to pi0.5. Our results establish SimVLA as a robust, reproducible baseline that enables clear attribution of empirical gains to future architectural innovations.

      <title>Simplifying Outcomes of Language Model Component Analyses with ELIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While mechanistic interpretability has developed powerful tools to analyze the internal workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), their complexity has created an accessibility gap, limiting their use to specialists. We address this challenge by designing, building, and evaluating ELIA (Explainable Language Interpretability Analysis), an interactive web application that simplifies the outcomes of various language model component analyses for a broader audience. The system integrates three key techniques -- Attribution Analysis, Function Vector Analysis, and Circuit Tracing -- and introduces a novel methodology: using a vision-language model to automatically generate natural language explanations (NLEs) for the complex visualizations produced by these methods. The effectiveness of this approach was empirically validated through a mixed-methods user study, which revealed a clear preference for interactive, explorable interfaces over simpler, static visualizations. A key finding was that the AI-powered explanations helped bridge the knowledge gap for non-experts; a statistical analysis showed no significant correlation between a user's prior LLM experience and their comprehension scores, suggesting that the system reduced barriers to comprehension across experience levels. We conclude that an AI system can indeed simplify complex model analyses, but its true power is unlocked when paired with thoughtful, user-centered design that prioritizes interactivity, specificity, and narrative guidance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models have achieved striking results in interactive theorem proving, particularly in Lean. However, most benchmarks for LLM-based proof automation are drawn from mathematics in the Mathlib ecosystem, whereas proofs in software verification are developed inside definition-rich codebases with substantial project-specific libraries. We introduce VeriSoftBench, a benchmark of 500 Lean 4 proof obligations drawn from open-source formal-methods developments and packaged to preserve realistic repository context and cross-file dependencies. Our evaluation of frontier LLMs and specialized provers yields three observations. First, provers tuned for Mathlib-style mathematics transfer poorly to this repository-centric setting. Second, success is strongly correlated with transitive repository dependence: tasks whose proofs draw on large, multi-hop dependency closures are less likely to be solved. Third, providing curated context restricted to a proof's dependency closure improves performance relative to exposing the full repository, but nevertheless leaves substantial room for improvement. Our benchmark and evaluation suite are released at https://github.com/utopia-group/VeriSoftBench.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) approaches have shown promising results for predicting molecular properties relevant for chemical process design. However, they are often limited by scarce experimental property data and lack thermodynamic consistency. As such, thermodynamics-informed ML, i.e., incorporating thermodynamic relations into the loss function as regularization term for training, has been proposed. We herein transfer the concept of thermodynamics-informed graph neural networks (GNNs) from the Gibbs-Duhem to the Clapeyron equation, predicting several pure component properties in a multi-task manner, namely: vapor pressure, liquid molar volume, vapor molar volume and enthalpy of vaporization. We find improved prediction accuracy of the Clapeyron-GNN compared to the single-task learning setting, and improved approximation of the Clapeyron equation compared to the purely data-driven multi-task learning setting. In fact, we observe the largest improvement in prediction accuracy for the properties with the lowest availability of data, making our model promising for practical application in data scarce scenarios of chemical engineering practice.</description>

Abstract: We present the first motion generation system for playtesting virtual reality (VR) games. Our player model generates VR headset and handheld controller movements from in-game object arrangements, guided by style exemplars and aligned to maximize simulated gameplay score. We train on the large BOXRR-23 dataset and apply our framework on the popular VR game Beat Saber. The resulting model Robo-Saber produces skilled gameplay and captures diverse player behaviors, mirroring the skill levels and movement patterns specified by input style exemplars. Robo-Saber demonstrates promise in synthesizing rich gameplay data for predictive applications and enabling a physics-based whole-body VR playtesting agent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the application of a quantum feature extraction method to enhance multi-class image classification for space applications. By harnessing the dynamics of many-body spin Hamiltonians, the method generates expressive quantum features that, when combined with classical processing, lead to quantum-enhanced classification accuracy. Using a strong and well-established ResNet50 baseline, we achieved a maximum classical accuracy of 83%, which can be improved to 84% with a transfer learning approach. In contrast, applying our quantum-classical method the performance is increased to 87% accuracy, demonstrating a clear and reproducible improvement over robust classical approaches. Implemented on several of IBM's quantum processors, our hybrid quantum-classical approach delivers consistent gains of 2-3% in absolute accuracy. These results highlight the practical potential of current and near-term quantum processors in high-stakes, data-driven domains such as satellite imaging and remote sensing, while suggesting broader applicability in real-world machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Maximum Likelihood Prediction via Hilbert Space Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works have proposed various explanations for the ability of modern large language models (LLMs) to perform in-context prediction. We propose an alternative conceptual viewpoint from an information-geometric and statistical perspective. Motivated by Bach[2023], we model training as learning an embedding of probability distributions into the space of quantum density operators, and in-context learning as maximum-likelihood prediction over a specified class of quantum models. We provide an interpretation of this predictor in terms of quantum reverse information projection and quantum Pythagorean theorem when the class of quantum models is sufficiently expressive. We further derive non-asymptotic performance guarantees in terms of convergence rates and concentration inequalities, both in trace norm and quantum relative entropy. Our approach provides a unified framework to handle both classical and quantum LLMs.</description>

      <title>Theory and interpretability of Quantum Extreme Learning Machines: a Pauli-transfer matrix approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computers (QRCs) have emerged as a promising approach to quantum machine learning, since they utilize the natural dynamics of quantum systems for data processing and are simple to train. Here, we consider n-qubit quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs) with continuous-time reservoir dynamics. QELMs are memoryless QRCs capable of various ML tasks, including image classification and time series forecasting. We apply the Pauli transfer matrix (PTM) formalism to theoretically analyze the influence of encoding, reservoir dynamics, and measurement operations, including temporal multiplexing, on the QELM performance. This formalism makes explicit that the encoding determines the complete set of (nonlinear) features available to the QELM, while the quantum channels linearly transform these features before they are probed by the chosen measurement operators. Optimizing a QELM can therefore be cast as a decoding problem in which one shapes the channel-induced transformations such that task-relevant features become available to the regressor. The PTM formalism allows one to identify the classical representation of a QELM and thereby guide its design towards a given training objective. As a specific application, we focus on learning nonlinear dynamical systems and show that a QELM trained on such trajectories learns a surrogate-approximation to the underlying flow map.</description>

      <title>Learning to Tune Pure Pursuit in Autonomous Racing: Joint Lookahead and Steering-Gain Control with PPO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pure Pursuit (PP) is widely used in autonomous racing for real-time path tracking due to its efficiency and geometric clarity, yet performance is highly sensitive to how key parameters-lookahead distance and steering gain-are chosen. Standard velocity-based schedules adjust these only approximately and often fail to transfer across tracks and speed profiles. We propose a reinforcement-learning (RL) approach that jointly chooses the lookahead Ld and a steering gain g online using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The policy observes compact state features (speed and curvature taps) and outputs (Ld, g) at each control step. Trained in F1TENTH Gym and deployed in a ROS 2 stack, the policy drives PP directly (with light smoothing) and requires no per-map retuning. Across simulation and real-car tests, the proposed RL-PP controller that jointly selects (Ld, g) consistently outperforms fixed-lookahead PP, velocity-scheduled adaptive PP, and an RL lookahead-only variant, and it also exceeds a kinematic MPC raceline tracker under our evaluated settings in lap time, path-tracking accuracy, and steering smoothness, demonstrating that policy-guided parameter tuning can reliably improve classical geometry-based control.</description>

      <title>Latent Equivariant Operators for Robust Object Recognition: Promise and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the successes of deep learning in computer vision, difficulties persist in recognizing objects that have undergone group-symmetric transformations rarely seen during training-for example objects seen in unusual poses, scales, positions, or combinations thereof. Equivariant neural networks are a solution to the problem of generalizing across symmetric transformations, but require knowledge of transformations a priori. An alternative family of architectures proposes to earn equivariant operators in a latent space from examples of symmetric transformations. Here, using simple datasets of rotated and translated noisy MNIST, we illustrate how such architectures can successfully be harnessed for out-of-distribution classification, thus overcoming the limitations of both traditional and equivariant networks. While conceptually enticing, we discuss challenges ahead on the path of scaling these architectures to more complex datasets.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks in Solving Hard Constraint Satisfaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly applied to hard optimization problems, often claiming superiority over classical heuristics. However, such claims risk being unsolid due to a lack of standard benchmarks on truly hard instances. From a statistical physics perspective, we propose new hard benchmarks based on random problems. We provide these benchmarks, along with performance results from both classical heuristics and GNNs. Our fair comparison shows that classical algorithms still outperform GNNs. We discuss the challenges for neural networks in this domain. Future claims of superiority can be made more robust using our benchmarks, available at https://github.com/ArtLabBocconi/RandCSPBench.</description>

Abstract: Deep neural networks are often used to implement powerful generative models for real-world data. Notable applications include image denoising, as well as other classical inverse problems like compressed sensing and super-resolution. To provide a rigorous but simplified analysis of generative models, in this work, we introduce an elegant theoretical framework based on spherical harmonics, namely \textbf{SUNLayer}. Our theoretical framework identifies explicit conditions on activation functions that guarantee denoising under local optimization. Numerical experiments examine the theoretical properties on commonly used activation functions and demonstrate their stable denoising performance.</description>

      <title>Convergence of gradient descent for deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.16462v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a simple local Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) criterion that guarantees linear (exponential) convergence of gradient flow and gradient descent to a zero-loss solution of a nonnegative objective. We then verify this criterion for the squared training loss of a feedforward neural network with smooth, strictly increasing activation functions, in a regime that is complementary to the usual over-parameterized analyses: the network width and depth are fixed, while the input data vectors are assumed to be linearly independent (in particular, the ambient input dimension is at least the number of data points). A notable feature of the verification is that it is constructive: it leads to a simple "positive" initialization (zero first-layer weights, strictly positive hidden-layer weights, and sufficiently large output-layer weights) under which gradient descent provably converges to an interpolating global minimizer of the training loss. We also discuss a probabilistic corollary for random initializations, clarify its dependence on the probability of the required initialization event, and provide numerical experiments showing that this theory-guided initialization can substantially accelerate optimization relative to standard random initializations at the same width.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Analyzing Meta-algorithms in Online Convex Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08621v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the problem of online convex optimization in different settings, including different feedback types (full-information/semi-bandit/bandit/etc) in either stochastic or non-stochastic setting and different notions of regret (static adversarial regret/dynamic regret/adaptive regret). This is done through a framework which allows us to systematically propose and analyze meta-algorithms for the various settings described above. We show that any algorithm for online linear optimization with deterministic gradient feedback against fully adaptive adversaries is an algorithm for online convex optimization. We also show that any such algorithm that requires full-information feedback may be transformed to an algorithm with semi-bandit feedback with comparable regret bound. We further show that algorithms that are designed for fully adaptive adversaries using deterministic semi-bandit feedback can obtain similar bounds using only stochastic semi-bandit feedback when facing oblivious adversaries. We use this to describe general meta-algorithms to convert first order algorithms to zeroth order algorithms with comparable regret bounds. Our framework allows us to analyze online optimization in various settings, recovers several results in the literature with a simplified proof technique, and provides new results.</description>

      <title>Expressiveness of Multi-Neuron Convex Relaxations in Neural Network Certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06816v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural network certification methods heavily rely on convex relaxations to provide robustness guarantees. However, these relaxations are often imprecise: even the most accurate single-neuron relaxation is incomplete for general ReLU networks, a limitation known as the *single-neuron convex barrier*. While multi-neuron relaxations have been heuristically applied to address this issue, two central questions arise: (i) whether they overcome the convex barrier, and if not, (ii) whether they offer theoretical capabilities beyond those of single-neuron relaxations. In this work, we present the first rigorous analysis of the expressiveness of multi-neuron relaxations. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that they are inherently incomplete, even when allocated sufficient resources to capture finitely many neurons and layers optimally. This result extends the single-neuron barrier to a *universal convex barrier* for neural network certification. On the positive side, we show that completeness can be achieved by either (i) augmenting the network with a polynomial number of carefully designed ReLU neurons or (ii) partitioning the input domain into convex sub-polytopes, thereby distinguishing multi-neuron relaxations from single-neuron ones which are unable to realize the former and have worse partition complexity for the latter. Our findings establish a foundation for multi-neuron relaxations and point to new directions for certified robustness, including training methods tailored to multi-neuron relaxations and verification methods with multi-neuron relaxations as the main subroutine.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Inference of Neural Fluid Fields via SciML Foundation Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in 3D vision have enabled significant progress in inferring neural fluid fields and realistic rendering of fluid dynamics. However, these methods require dense captures of real-world flows, which demand specialized laboratory setups, making the process costly and challenging. Scientific machine learning (SciML) foundation models, pretrained on extensive simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs), encode rich multiphysics knowledge and thus provide promising sources of domain priors for fluid field inference. Nevertheless, the transferability of these foundation models to real-world vision problems remains largely underexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that SciML foundation models can significantly reduce the data requirements for inferring real-world 3D fluid dynamics while improving generalization. Our method leverages the strong forecasting capabilities and meaningful representations learned by SciML foundation models. We introduce a novel collaborative training strategy that equips neural fluid fields with augmented frames and fluid features extracted from the foundation model. Extensive experiments show substantial improvements in both quantitative metrics and visual quality over prior approaches. In particular, our method achieves a 9-36% improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for future prediction while reducing the number of required training frames by 25-50%. These results highlight the practical applicability of SciML foundation models for real-world fluid dynamics reconstruction.

Abstract: Compound identification and structure annotation from mass spectra is a well-established task widely applied in drug detection, criminal forensics, small molecule biomarker discovery and chemical engineering.
  We propose SpecTUS: Spectral Translator for Unknown Structures, a deep neural model that addresses the task of structural annotation of small molecules from low-resolution gas chromatography electron ionization mass spectra (GC-EI-MS). Our model analyzes the spectra in \textit{de novo} manner -- a direct translation from the spectra into 2D-structural representation. Our approach is particularly useful for analyzing compounds unavailable in spectral libraries.
  In a rigorous evaluation of our model on the novel structure annotation task across different libraries, we outperformed standard database search techniques by a wide margin. On a held-out testing set, including \numprint{28267} spectra from the NIST database, we show that our model's single suggestion perfectly reconstructs 43\% of the subset's compounds. This single suggestion is strictly better than the candidate of the database hybrid search (common method among practitioners)
  in 76\% of cases. In a~still affordable scenario of~10 suggestions, perfect reconstruction is achieved in 65\%, and 84\% are better than the hybrid search.</description>

      <title>Co-Evolution-Based Metal-Binding Residue Prediction with Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding protein-metal interactions is central to structural biology, with metal ions being vital for catalysis, stability, and signal transduction. Predicting metal-binding residues and metal types remains challenging due to the structural and evolutionary complexity of proteins. Conventional sequence- and structure-based methods often fail to capture co-evolutionary constraints that reflect how residues evolve together to maintain metal-binding functionality. Recent co-evolution-based methods capture part of this information, but still underutilize the complete co-evolved residue network. To address this limitation, we introduce the Metal-Binding Graph Neural Network (MBGNN), which leverages the complete co-evolved residue network to better capture complex dependencies within protein structures. Experimental results show that MBGNN substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art co-evolution-based method MetalNet2, achieving F1 score improvements of 2.5% for binding residue identification and 3.3% for metal type classification on the MetalNet2 dataset. Its superiority is further demonstrated on both the MetalNet2 and MIonSite datasets, where it outperforms two co-evolution-based and two sequence-based methods, achieving the highest mean F1 scores across both prediction tasks. These findings highlight how integrating co-evolutionary residue networks with graph-based learning advances our ability to decode protein-metal interactions, thereby facilitating functional annotation and rational metalloprotein design. The code and data are released at https://github.com/SRastegari/MBGNN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07199v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent methods for auditing the privacy of machine learning algorithms have improved computational efficiency by simultaneously intervening on multiple training examples in a single training run. Steinke et al. (2024) prove that one-run auditing indeed lower bounds the true privacy parameter of the audited algorithm, and give impressive empirical results. Their work leaves open the question of how precisely one-run auditing can uncover the true privacy parameter of an algorithm, and how that precision depends on the audited algorithm. In this work, we characterize the maximum achievable efficacy of one-run auditing and show that the key barrier to its efficacy is interference between the observable effects of different data elements. We present new conceptual approaches to minimize this barrier, towards improving the performance of one-run auditing of real machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Lean Formalization of Generalization Error Bound by Rademacher Complexity and Dudley's Entropy Integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19605v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and certifying the generalization performance of machine learning algorithms -- i.e. obtaining theoretical estimates of the test error from a finite training sample -- is a central theme of statistical learning theory. Among the many complexity measures used to derive such guarantees, Rademacher complexity yields sharp, data-dependent bounds that apply well beyond classical $0$--$1$ classification. In this study, we formalize the generalization error bound by Rademacher complexity in Lean 4, building on measure-theoretic probability theory available in the Mathlib library. Our development provides a mechanically-checked pipeline from the definitions of empirical and expected Rademacher complexity, through a formal symmetrization argument and a bounded-differences analysis, to high-probability uniform deviation bounds via a formally proved McDiarmid inequality. A key technical contribution is a reusable mechanism for lifting results from countable hypothesis classes (where measurability of suprema is straightforward in Mathlib) to separable topological index sets via a reduction to a countable dense subset. As worked applications of the abstract theorem, we mechanize standard empirical Rademacher bounds for linear predictors under $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$ regularization, and we also formalize a Dudley-type entropy integral bound based on covering numbers and a chaining construction.</description>

Abstract: Model diffing is the study of how fine-tuning changes a model's representations and internal algorithms. Many behaviors of interest are introduced during fine-tuning, and model diffing offers a promising lens to interpret such behaviors. Crosscoders are a recent model diffing method that learns a shared dictionary of interpretable concepts represented as latent directions in both the base and fine-tuned models, allowing us to track how concepts shift or emerge during fine-tuning. Notably, prior work has observed concepts with no direction in the base model, and it was hypothesized that these model-specific latents were concepts introduced during fine-tuning. However, we identify two issues which stem from the crosscoders L1 training loss that can misattribute concepts as unique to the fine-tuned model, when they really exist in both models. We develop Latent Scaling to flag these issues by more accurately measuring each latent's presence across models. In experiments comparing Gemma 2 2B base and chat models, we observe that the standard crosscoder suffers heavily from these issues. Building on these insights, we train a crosscoder with BatchTopK loss and show that it substantially mitigates these issues, finding more genuinely chat-specific and highly interpretable concepts. We recommend practitioners adopt similar techniques. Using the BatchTopK crosscoder, we successfully identify a set of chat-specific latents that are both interpretable and causally effective, representing concepts such as $\textit{false information}$ and $\textit{personal question}$, along with multiple refusal-related latents that show nuanced preferences for different refusal triggers. Overall, our work advances best practices for the crosscoder-based methodology for model diffing and demonstrates that it can provide concrete insights into how chat-tuning modifies model behavior.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions (MLLMs) have substantially enhanced machine reasoning across diverse tasks. However, these models predominantly rely on pure text as the medium for both expressing and structuring reasoning, even when visual information is present. In this work, we argue that language may not always be the most natural or effective modality for reasoning, particularly in tasks involving spatial and geometrical information. Motivated by this, we propose a new paradigm, Visual Planning, which enables planning through purely visual representations for these "vision-first" tasks, as a supplementary channel to language-based reasoning. In this paradigm, planning is executed via sequences of images that encode step-by-step inference in the visual domain, akin to how humans sketch or visualize future actions. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework, Visual Planning via Reinforcement Learning (VPRL), empowered by GRPO for post-training large vision models, leading to substantial improvements in planning in a selection of representative visual navigation tasks, FrozenLake, Maze, and MiniBehavior. Our visual planning paradigm outperforms all other planning variants that conduct reasoning in the text-only space. Our results establish Visual Planning as a viable and promising supplement to language-based reasoning, opening new avenues for tasks that benefit from intuitive, image-based inference.</description>

      <title>Better Neural Network Expressivity: Subdividing the Simplex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the expressivity of ReLU neural networks with a focus on their depth. A sequence of previous works showed that $\lceil \log_2(n+1) \rceil$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Hertrich, Basu, Di Summa, and Skutella (NeurIPS'21 / SIDMA'23) conjectured that this result is optimal in the sense that there are CPWL functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, like the maximum function, that require this depth. We disprove the conjecture and show that $\lceil\log_3(n-1)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all CPWL functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
  A key step in the proof is that ReLU neural networks with two hidden layers can exactly represent the maximum function of five inputs. More generally, we show that $\lceil\log_3(n-2)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute the maximum of $n\geq 4$ numbers. Our constructions almost match the $\lceil\log_3(n)\rceil$ lower bound of Averkov, Hojny, and Merkert (ICLR'25) in the special case of ReLU networks with weights that are decimal fractions. The constructions have a geometric interpretation via polyhedral subdivisions of the simplex into ``easier'' polytopes.</description>

      <title>Assimilative Causal Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal inference is fundamental across scientific disciplines, yet existing methods struggle to capture instantaneous, time-evolving causal relationships in complex, high-dimensional systems. In this paper, assimilative causal inference (ACI) is developed, which is a methodological framework that leverages Bayesian data assimilation to trace causes backward from observed effects. ACI solves the inverse problem rather than quantifying forward influence. It uniquely identifies dynamic causal interactions without requiring observations of candidate causes, accommodates short datasets, and, in principle, can be implemented in high-dimensional settings by employing efficient data assimilation algorithms. Crucially, it provides online tracking of causal roles that may reverse intermittently and facilitates a mathematically rigorous criterion for the causal influence range, revealing how far effects propagate. The effectiveness of ACI is demonstrated by complex dynamical systems showcasing intermittency and extreme events. ACI opens valuable pathways for studying complex systems, where transient causal structures are critical.</description>

      <title>Soft-CAM: Making black box models self-explainable for medical image analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used for high-stakes applications like medicine, often surpassing human performance. However, most explanation methods rely on post-hoc attribution, approximating the decision-making process of already trained black-box models. These methods are often sensitive, unreliable, and fail to reflect true model reasoning, limiting their trustworthiness in critical applications. In this work, we introduce SoftCAM, a straightforward yet effective approach that makes standard CNN architectures inherently interpretable. By removing the global average pooling layer and replacing the fully connected classification layer with a convolution-based class evidence layer, SoftCAM preserves spatial information and produces explicit class activation maps that form the basis of the model's predictions. Evaluated on three medical datasets, SoftCAM maintains classification performance while significantly improving both the qualitative and quantitative explanation compared to existing post-hoc methods. Our results demonstrate that CNNs can be inherently interpretable without compromising performance, advancing the development of self-explainable deep learning for high-stakes decision-making.

      <title>Generative Distribution Embeddings: Lifting autoencoders to the space of distributions for multiscale representation learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world problems require reasoning across multiple scales, demanding models which operate not on single data points, but on entire distributions. We introduce generative distribution embeddings (GDE), a framework that lifts autoencoders to the space of distributions. In GDEs, an encoder acts on sets of samples, and the decoder is replaced by a generator which aims to match the input distribution. This framework enables learning representations of distributions by coupling conditional generative models with encoder networks which satisfy a criterion we call distributional invariance. We show that GDEs learn predictive sufficient statistics embedded in the Wasserstein space, such that latent GDE distances approximately recover the $W_2$ distance, and latent interpolation approximately recovers optimal transport trajectories for Gaussian and Gaussian mixture distributions. We systematically benchmark GDEs against existing approaches on synthetic datasets, demonstrating consistently stronger performance. We then apply GDEs to six key problems in computational biology: learning donor-level representations from single-nuclei RNA sequencing data (6M cells), capturing clonal dynamics in lineage-traced RNA sequencing data (150K cells), predicting perturbation effects on transcriptomes (1M cells), predicting perturbation effects on cellular phenotypes (20M single-cell images), designing synthetic yeast promoters (34M sequences), and spatiotemporal modeling of viral protein sequences (1M sequences).</description>

      <title>Sign-SGD via Parameter-Free Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03725v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models have achieved major advances across domains, yet training them remains extremely resource-intensive. We revisit Sign-SGD, which serves both as a memory-efficient optimizer for single-node training and as a gradient compression mechanism for distributed learning. This paper addresses a central limitation: the effective stepsize cannot be determined a priori because it relies on unknown, problem-specific quantities. We present a parameter-free Sign-SGD that removes manual stepsize selection. We analyze the deterministic single-node case, and extend the method to stochastic single-node training and multi-node settings. We also incorporate the momentum technique into our algorithms and propose a memory-efficient variant that stores only gradient signs instead of full gradients. We evaluate our methods on pre-training LLaMA models (130M and 350M) and fine-tuning a Swin Transformer (28M). Across considered tasks, the proposed methods match the performance of tuned Sign-SGD and AdamW (grid-searched stepsizes with a cosine schedule), while avoiding tuning overhead. Employing parameter-free training yields approximately $1.5\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to runs with grid-searched stepsizes.</description>

Abstract: We study gradient-based data attribution, aiming to identify which training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods for this task either treat network parameters uniformly or rely on implicit weighting derived from Hessian approximations, which do not fully model functional heterogeneity of network parameters. To address this, we propose a method to explicitly learn parameter importance weights directly from data, without requiring annotated labels. Our approach improves attribution accuracy across diverse tasks, including image classification, language modeling, and diffusion, and enables fine-grained attribution for concepts like subject and style.</description>

      <title>Beyond Simple Graphs: Neural Multi-Objective Routing on Multigraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22095v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning-based methods for routing have gained significant attention in recent years, both in single-objective and multi-objective contexts. Yet, existing methods are unsuitable for routing on multigraphs, which feature multiple edges with distinct attributes between node pairs, despite their strong relevance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose two graph neural network-based methods to address multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach operates directly on the multigraph by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed. The second model, which is more scalable, first simplifies the multigraph via a learned pruning strategy and then performs autoregressive routing on the resulting simple graph. We evaluate both models empirically, across a wide range of problems and graph distributions, and demonstrate their competitive performance compared to strong heuristics and neural baselines.</description>

      <title>GAGA: Gaussianity-Aware Gaussian Approximation for Efficient 3D Molecular Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian Probability Path based Generative Models (GPPGMs) generate data by reversing a stochastic process that progressively corrupts samples with Gaussian noise. Despite state-of-the-art results in 3D molecular generation, their deployment is hindered by the high cost of long generative trajectories, often requiring hundreds to thousands of steps during training and sampling. In this work, we propose a principled method, named GAGA, to improve generation efficiency without sacrificing training granularity or inference fidelity of GPPGMs. Our key insight is that different data modalities obtain sufficient Gaussianity at markedly different steps during the forward process. Based on this observation, we analytically identify a characteristic step at which molecular data attains sufficient Gaussianity, after which the trajectory can be replaced by a closed-form Gaussian approximation. Unlike existing accelerators that coarsen or reformulate trajectories, our approach preserves full-resolution learning dynamics while avoiding redundant transport through truncated distributional states. Experiments on 3D molecular generation benchmarks demonstrate that our GAGA achieves substantial improvement on both generation quality and computational efficiency.</description>

Abstract: How can large language models (LLMs) serve users with varying preferences that may conflict across cultural, political, or other dimensions? To advance this challenge, this paper establishes four key results. First, we demonstrate, through a large-scale multilingual human study with representative samples from five countries (N=15,000), that humans exhibit substantially more variation in preferences than the responses of 21 state-of-the-art LLMs. Second, we show that existing methods for preference dataset collection are insufficient for learning the diversity of human preferences even along two of the most salient dimensions of variability in global values, due to the underlying homogeneity of candidate responses. Third, we argue that this motivates the need for negatively-correlated sampling when generating candidate sets, and we show that simple prompt-based techniques for doing so greatly enhance the performance of alignment methods in learning heterogeneous preferences. Fourth, based on this novel candidate sampling approach, we collect and open-source Community Alignment} the largest and most representative multilingual and multi-turn preference dataset to date, featuring 233,319 comparisons from annotators spanning five countries. Overall, we hope that the Community Alignment dataset will be a valuable resource for improving the effectiveness of LLMs for a diverse global population.</description>

      <title>Decomposing Representation Space into Interpretable Subspaces with Unsupervised Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding internal representations of neural models is a core interest of mechanistic interpretability. Due to its large dimensionality, the representation space can encode various aspects about inputs. To what extent are different aspects organized and encoded in separate subspaces? Is it possible to find these ``natural'' subspaces in a purely unsupervised way? Somewhat surprisingly, we can indeed achieve this and find interpretable subspaces by a seemingly unrelated training objective. Our method, neighbor distance minimization (NDM), learns non-basis-aligned subspaces in an unsupervised manner. Qualitative analysis shows subspaces are interpretable in many cases, and encoded information in obtained subspaces tends to share the same abstract concept across different inputs, making such subspaces similar to ``variables'' used by the model. We also conduct quantitative experiments using known circuits in GPT-2; results show a strong connection between subspaces and circuit variables. We also provide evidence showing scalability to 2B models by finding separate subspaces mediating context and parametric knowledge routing. Viewed more broadly, our findings offer a new perspective on understanding model internals and building circuits.</description>

      <title>M3OOD: Automatic Selection of Multimodal OOD Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness is a critical challenge for modern machine learning systems, particularly as they increasingly operate in multimodal settings involving inputs like video, audio, and sensor data. Currently, many OOD detection methods have been proposed, each with different designs targeting various distribution shifts. A single OOD detector may not prevail across all the scenarios; therefore, how can we automatically select an ideal OOD detection model for different distribution shifts? Due to the inherent unsupervised nature of the OOD detection task, it is difficult to predict model performance and find a universally Best model. Also, systematically comparing models on the new unseen data is costly or even impractical. To address this challenge, we introduce M3OOD, a meta-learning-based framework for OOD detector selection in multimodal settings. Meta learning offers a solution by learning from historical model behaviors, enabling rapid adaptation to new data distribution shifts with minimal supervision. Our approach combines multimodal embeddings with handcrafted meta-features that capture distributional and cross-modal characteristics to represent datasets. By leveraging historical performance across diverse multimodal benchmarks, M3OOD can recommend suitable detectors for a new data distribution shift. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that M3OOD consistently outperforms 10 competitive baselines across 12 test scenarios with minimal computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Classification errors distort findings in automated speech processing: examples and solutions from child-development research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper's main contributions are drawing attention to downstream effects of confusion errors, and providing an approach to measure and potentially recover from these errors. Specifically, we use a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language experience and the association between children's production and their input. By fitting a joint model of speech behavior and algorithm behavior on real and simulated data, we show that classification errors can significantly distort estimates for both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and a slightly more accurate open-source alternative (the Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system). We further show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof solution.</description>

Abstract: We propose an evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization for Replica-Exchange-based Physics-informed operator-learning Networks (Morephy-Net) to solve parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) in noisy data regimes, for both forward prediction and inverse identification. Existing physics-informed neural networks and operator-learning models (e.g., DeepONets and Fourier neural operators) often face three coupled challenges: (i) balancing data/operator and physics residual losses, (ii) maintaining robustness under noisy or sparse observations, and (iii) providing reliable uncertainty quantification. Morephy-Net addresses these issues by integrating: (i) evolutionary multi-objective optimization that treats data/operator and physics residual terms as separate objectives and searches the Pareto front, thereby avoiding ad hoc loss weighting; (ii) replica-exchange stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to enhance global exploration and stabilize training in non-convex landscapes; and (iii) Bayesian uncertainty quantification obtained from stochastic sampling. We validate Morephy-Net on representative forward and inverse problems, including the one-dimensional Burgers equation and the time-fractional mixed diffusion--wave equation. The results demonstrate consistent improvements in accuracy, noise robustness, and calibrated uncertainty estimates over standard operator-learning baselines.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically consistent machine learning model for excess Gibbs energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The excess Gibbs energy plays a central role in chemical engineering and chemistry, providing a basis for modeling thermodynamic properties of liquid mixtures. Predicting the excess Gibbs energy of multi-component mixtures solely from molecular structures is a long-standing challenge. We address this challenge with HANNA, a flexible machine learning model for excess Gibbs energy that integrates physical laws as hard constraints, guaranteeing thermodynamically consistent predictions. HANNA is trained on experimental data for vapor-liquid equilibria, liquid-liquid equilibria, activity coefficients at infinite dilution and excess enthalpies in binary mixtures. The end-to-end training on liquid-liquid equilibrium data is facilitated by a surrogate solver. A geometric projection method enables robust extrapolations to multi-component mixtures. We demonstrate that HANNA delivers accurate predictions, while providing a substantially broader domain of applicability than state-of-the-art benchmark methods. The trained model and corresponding code are openly available, and an interactive interface is provided on our website, MLPROP.</description>

      <title>Individualized and Interpretable Sleep Forecasting via a Two-Stage Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sleep quality impacts well-being. Therefore, healthcare providers and individuals need accessible and reliable forecasting tools for preventive interventions. This paper introduces an interpretable, individualized adaptive spatial-temporal model for predicting sleep quality. We designed a hierarchical architecture, consisting of parallel 1D convolutions with varying kernel sizes and dilated convolution, which extracts multi-resolution temporal patterns-short kernels capture rapid physiological changes, while larger kernels and dilation model slower trends. The extracted features are then refined through channel attention, which learns to emphasize the most predictive variables for each individual, followed by bidirectional LSTM and self-attention that jointly model both local sequential dynamics and global temporal dependencies. Finally, a two-stage adaptation strategy ensures the learned representations transfer effectively to new users. We conducted various experiments with five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 days) and five prediction window sizes (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days). Our model consistently outperformed time series forecasting baseline approaches, including LSTM, Informer, PatchTST, and TimesNet. The best performance was achieved with a three-day input window and a one-day prediction window, yielding an RMSE of 0.216. Furthermore, the model demonstrated good predictive performance even for longer forecasting horizons (e.g., with a 0.257 RMSE for a three-day prediction window), highlighting its practical utility for real-world applications. We also conducted an explainability analysis to examine how different features influence sleep quality. These findings proved that the proposed framework offers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Wave Scattering Numerical Modeling Using the Boundary Element Method and Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study compares the Boundary Element Method (BEM) and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation in wave scattering problems. The objective is to evaluate the performance of both methods under the same conditions. We solve the Helmholtz equation using BEM and PINNs for the same scattering problem. PINNs are trained by minimizing the residual of the governing equations and boundary conditions with their configuration determined through hyperparameter optimization, while BEM is applied using boundary discretization. Both methods are evaluated in terms of solution accuracy and computation time. We conducted numerical experiments by varying the number of boundary integration points for the BEM and the number of hidden layers and neurons per layer for the PINNs. We performed a hyperparameter tuning to identify an adequate PINN configuration for this problem as a network with 3 hidden layers and 25 neurons per layer, using a learning rate of $10^{-2}$ and a sine activation function. At comparable levels of accuracy, the assembly and solution of the BEM system required a computational time on the order of $10^{-2}$~s, whereas the training time of the PINN was on the order of $10^{2}$~s, corresponding to a difference of approximately four orders of magnitude. However, once trained, the PINN achieved evaluation times on the order of $10^{-2}$~s, which is about two orders of magnitude faster than the evaluation of the BEM solution at interior points. This work establishes a procedure for comparing BEM and PINNs. It also presents a direct comparison between the two methods for the scattering problem. The analysis provides quantitative data on their performance, supporting their use in future research on wave propagation problems and outlining challenges and directions for further investigation.</description>

      <title>GRPO is Secretly a Process Reward Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) allow for fine-grained credit assignment in reinforcement learning (RL), and seemingly contrast with outcome reward models (ORMs), which assign a single reward to an entire trajectory. However, we provide theoretical proof in this work that the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) RL algorithm equipped with an ORM is in fact equivalent to a PRM-aware RL objective equipped with a non-trivial, Monte-Carlo-based PRM (given mild assumptions). Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a flaw in the GRPO objective that interacts with imbalanced process steps and rewards to hinder both exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($\lambda$-GRPO), and show that LLMs tuned with $\lambda$-GRPO outperform LLMs tuned with standard GRPO on downstream reasoning tasks\textemdash and reach peak performance more rapidly. These results show that we can leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance without employing an explicit PRM, and with a negligible impact on training time and cost.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed GNN for medium-high voltage AC power flow with edge-aware attention and line search correction operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed graph neural networks (PIGNNs) have emerged as fast AC power-flow solvers that can replace the classic NewtonRaphson (NR) solvers, especially when thousands of scenarios must be evaluated. However, current PIGNNs still need accuracy improvements at parity speed; in particular, the soft constraint on the physics loss is inoperative at inference, which can deter operational adoption. We address this with PIGNN-Attn-LS, combining an edge-aware attention mechanism that explicitly encodes line physics via per-edge biases to form a fully differentiable knownoperator layer inside the computation graph, with a backtracking line-search-based globalized correction operator that restores an operative decrease criterion at inference. Training and testing use a realistic High-/Medium-Voltage scenario generator, with NR used only to construct reference states. On held-out HV cases consisting of 4-32-bus grids, PIGNN-Attn-LS achieves a test RMSE of 0.00033 p.u. in voltage and 0.08 deg in angle, outperforming the PIGNN-MLP baseline by 99.5% and 87.1%, respectively. With streaming micro-batches, it delivers 2-5x faster batched inference than NR on 4-1024-bus grids.</description>

      <title>Toward a Holistic Approach to Continual Model Merging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a holistic framework for Continual Model Merging (CMM) that intervenes at three critical stages: pre-merging, during merging, and post-merging-to address two fundamental challenges in continual learning. In particular, conventional approaches either maintain a growing list of per-domain task vectors, leading to scalability issues or rely solely on weight-space merging when old data is inaccessible, thereby losing crucial functional information. Our method overcomes these limitations by first fine-tuning the main model within its tangent space on domain-specific data; this linearization amplifies per-task weight disentanglement, effectively mitigating across-task interference. During merging, we leverage functional information from available optimizer states beyond mere parameter averages to avoid the need to revisit old data. Finally, a post-merging correction aligns the representation discrepancy between pre- and post-merged models, reducing bias and enhancing overall performance-all while operating under constant memory constraints without accessing historical data. Extensive experiments on standard class-incremental and domain-incremental benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only achieves competitive performance but also provides a scalable and efficient solution to the catastrophic forgetting problem.</description>

      <title>xLSTM Scaling Laws: Competitive Performance with Linear Time-Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling laws play a central role in the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling the prediction of model performance relative to compute budgets prior to training. While Transformers have been the dominant architecture, recent alternatives such as xLSTM offer linear complexity with respect to context length while remaining competitive in the billion-parameter regime. We conduct a comparative investigation on the scaling behavior of Transformers and xLSTM along the following lines, providing insights to guide future model design and deployment. First, we study the scaling behavior for xLSTM in compute-optimal and over-training regimes using both IsoFLOP and parametric fit approaches on a wide range of model sizes (80M-7B) and number of training tokens (2B-2T). Second, we examine the dependence of optimal model sizes on context length, a pivotal aspect that was largely ignored in previous work. Finally, we analyze inference-time scaling characteristics. Our findings reveal that in typical LLM training and inference scenarios, xLSTM scales favorably compared to Transformers. Notably, xLSTM models consistently Pareto-dominate Transformer models, delivering lower cross-entropy loss for the same compute budget.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Subject Dependency in EEG Decoding with Subject-Specific Low-Rank Adapters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subject-specific distribution shifts represent a fundamental obstacle to developing foundation models for brain decoding. We propose the Subject-Specific Low-Rank Adapter (SuLoRA), a drop-in replacement for standard linear or convolutional layers that captures inter-subject variability by decomposing weights into a shared, subject-invariant component and a lightweight, low-rank correction unique to each subject. This explicit separation enables existing architectures to become robust to subject shifts without architectural redesign. We evaluate SuLoRA on MEG speech perception and EEG motor imagery tasks across CNN and transformer architectures. In the speech decoding task, SuLoRA exceeds the baseline performance with half of the parameters. On motor imagery dataset, SuLoRA outperforms both subject-agnostic models and independently trained subject-specific models. SuLoRA offers a practical path towards effective cross-subject foundation models for brain signal applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks are famously nonlinear. However, linearity is defined relative to a pair of vector spaces, $f:X \to Y$. Leveraging the algebraic concept of transport of structure, we propose a method to explicitly identify non-standard vector spaces where a neural network acts as a linear operator. When sandwiching a linear operator $A$ between two invertible neural networks, $f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A g_x(x))$, the corresponding vector spaces $X$ and $Y$ are induced by newly defined addition and scaling actions derived from $g_x$ and $g_y$. We term this kind of architecture a Linearizer. This framework makes the entire arsenal of linear algebra, including SVD, pseudo-inverse, orthogonal projection and more, applicable to nonlinear mappings. Furthermore, we show that the composition of two Linearizers that share a neural network is also a Linearizer. We leverage this property and demonstrate that training diffusion models using our architecture makes the hundreds of sampling steps collapse into a single step. We further utilize our framework to enforce idempotency (i.e. $f(f(x))=f(x)$) on networks leading to a globally projective generative model and to demonstrate modular style transfer.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Sign Masking for Task Vector Transport Across Pre-Trained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners typically need to repeat fine-tuning, even if the same task was already tackled in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a specific task. However, these vectors often fail to transfer across different pre-trained models because their parameter spaces are misaligned. In this work, we show that successful transfer depends strongly on the gradient-sign structure of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, which approximates the ideal sign structure and leverages it to transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this requires no additional fine-tuning: we only compute a few target-model gradients without parameter updates and mask the source task vector accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent. Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and few-shot fine-tuning. We further show that transporting task vectors improves multi-task and multi-source model merging. Code is available at https://github.com/fillo-rinaldi/GradFix.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Estimation by Flexible Evidential Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial for deploying machine learning models in high-stakes applications, where overconfident predictions can lead to serious consequences. An effective UQ method must balance computational efficiency with the ability to generalize across diverse scenarios. Evidential deep learning (EDL) achieves efficiency by modeling uncertainty through the prediction of a Dirichlet distribution over class probabilities. However, the restrictive assumption of Dirichlet-distributed class probabilities limits EDL's robustness, particularly in complex or unforeseen situations. To address this, we propose \textit{flexible evidential deep learning} ($\mathcal{F}$-EDL), which extends EDL by predicting a flexible Dirichlet distribution -- a generalization of the Dirichlet distribution -- over class probabilities. This approach provides a more expressive and adaptive representation of uncertainty, significantly enhancing UQ generalization and reliability under challenging scenarios. We theoretically establish several advantages of $\mathcal{F}$-EDL and empirically demonstrate its state-of-the-art UQ performance across diverse evaluation settings, including classical, long-tailed, and noisy in-distribution scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Memory-efficient training of deep neural networks has become increasingly important as models grow larger while deployment environments impose strict resource constraints. We propose TraDy, a novel transfer learning scheme leveraging two key insights: layer importance for updates is architecture-dependent and determinable a priori, while dynamic stochastic channel selection provides superior gradient approximation compared to static approaches. We introduce a dynamic channel selection approach that stochastically resamples channels between epochs within preselected layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate TraDy achieves state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks and architectures while maintaining strict memory constraints, achieving up to 99% activation sparsity, 95% weight derivative sparsity, and 97% reduction in FLOPs for weight derivative computation.</description>

      <title>FATE: A Formal Benchmark Series for Frontier Algebra of Multiple Difficulty Levels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in formal theorem proving, particularly on contest-based mathematical benchmarks like the IMO. However, these contests do not reflect the depth, breadth, and abstraction of modern mathematical research. To bridge this gap, we introduce FATE (Formal Algebra Theorem Evaluation), a new benchmark series in formal algebra designed to chart a course toward advanced mathematical reasoning. We present two new components, FATE-H and FATE-X, each with 100 problems in abstract and commutative algebra. The FATE series spans a difficulty spectrum from undergraduate exercises to problems exceeding PhD qualifying exams. Notably, FATE-X is the first formal benchmark to surpass both PhD-level exam difficulty and the coverage of the Mathlib library. Our evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM provers on this new benchmark reveal a stark performance gap compared to contest math: the best model achieves only 3% (pass@64) accuracy on FATE-H and 0% on FATE-X. Our two-stage evaluation reveals that models' natural-language reasoning is notably more accurate than their ability to formalize this reasoning. We systematically classify the common errors that arise during this formalization process. Furthermore, a comparative study shows that a specialized prover can exhibit less effective reflection than general-purpose models, reducing its accuracy at the natural-language stage. We believe FATE provides a robust and challenging benchmark that establishes essential checkpoints on the path toward research-level formal mathematical reasoning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in LLMs, the task of code generation is still challenging. To cope, code selection algorithms select the best program from multiple programs generated by an LLM. However, existing algorithms can fail to identify the correct program, either because they can misidentify nonequivalent programs or because they rely on an LLM and assume it always correctly determines the output for every input. We present ExPairT-LLM, an exact learning algorithm for code selection that selects a program by posing to an LLM oracle two new types of queries: pairwise membership and pairwise equivalence. These queries are simpler for LLMs and enable ExPairT-LLM to identify the correct program through a tournament, which is robust to some LLM mistakes. We evaluate ExPairT-LLM on four popular code datasets. Its pass@1 (success rate) outperforms the state-of-the-art code selection algorithm on average by +13.0% and up to +27.1%. It also improves the pass@1 of LLMs performing complex reasoning by +24.0%.</description>

      <title>Towards Realistic Guarantees: A Probabilistic Certificate for SmoothLLM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SmoothLLM defense provides a certification guarantee against jailbreaking attacks, but it relies on a strict "k-unstable" assumption that rarely holds in practice. This strong assumption can limit the trustworthiness of the provided safety certificate. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a more realistic probabilistic framework, "(k, $\varepsilon$)-unstable," to certify defenses against diverse jailbreaking attacks, from gradient-based (GCG) to semantic (PAIR). We derive a new, data-informed lower bound on SmoothLLM's defense probability by incorporating empirical models of attack success, providing a more trustworthy and practical safety certificate. By introducing the notion of (k, $\varepsilon$)-unstable, our framework provides practitioners with actionable safety guarantees, enabling them to set certification thresholds that better reflect the real-world behavior of LLMs. Ultimately, this work contributes a practical and theoretically-grounded mechanism to make LLMs more resistant to the exploitation of their safety alignments, a critical challenge in secure AI deployment.</description>

      <title>MIST: Mutual Information Estimation Via Supervised Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a fully data-driven approach to designing mutual information (MI) estimators. Since any MI estimator is a function of the observed sample from two random variables, we parameterize this function with a neural network (MIST) and train it end-to-end to predict MI values. Training is performed on a large meta-dataset of 625,000 synthetic joint distributions with known ground-truth MI. To handle variable sample sizes and dimensions, we employ a two-dimensional attention scheme ensuring permutation invariance across input samples. To quantify uncertainty, we optimize a quantile regression loss, enabling the estimator to approximate the sampling distribution of MI rather than return a single point estimate. This research program departs from prior work by taking a fully empirical route, trading universal theoretical guarantees for flexibility and efficiency. Empirically, the learned estimators largely outperform classical baselines across sample sizes and dimensions, including on joint distributions unseen during training. The resulting quantile-based intervals are well-calibrated and more reliable than bootstrap-based confidence intervals, while inference is orders of magnitude faster than existing neural baselines. Beyond immediate empirical gains, this framework yields trainable, fully differentiable estimators that can be embedded into larger learning pipelines. Moreover, exploiting MI's invariance to invertible transformations, meta-datasets can be adapted to arbitrary data modalities via normalizing flows, enabling flexible training for diverse target meta-distributions.</description>

      <title>CDLM: Consistency Diffusion Language Models For Faster Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a promising parallel generation paradigm but suffer from slow inference due to numerous refinement steps and the inability to use standard KV caching. We introduce CDLM (Consistency Diffusion Language Models), a training-based acceleration method that simultaneously tackles both bottlenecks. CDLM integrates consistency modeling to drastically reduce the number of required sampling steps by enabling multi-token finalization. Furthermore, we enforce a block-wise causal attention mask during fine-tuning, making the model fully compatible with KV caching. Experiments show CDLM achieves 3.6x-14.5x lower latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on math and coding tasks. The full training and evaluation code is available at https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/CDLM.</description>

      <title>Learning to Orchestrate Agents in Natural Language with the Conductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Powerful large language models (LLMs) from different providers have been expensively trained and finetuned to specialize across varying domains. In this work, we introduce a new kind of Conductor model trained with reinforcement learning to automatically discover powerful coordination strategies among LLMs. Our Conductor learns not only to design targeted communication topologies for effective agent-to-agent collaboration, but also to prompt engineer focused instructions to the LLMs to maximally leverage their individual capabilities. We show that, by learning optimal coordination strategies over pools of powerful worker LLMs, a 7B Conductor achieves significant performance gains beyond any individual worker, attaining state-of-the-art results in challenging reasoning benchmarks, such as LiveCodeBench and GPQA. By training with randomized agent pools, our conductor effectively adapts to arbitrary sets of open- and closed-source agents, meeting any user requirements. Furthermore, allowing the Conductor to select itself as a worker gives rise to recursive topologies, elevating performance with a new form of dynamic test-time scaling through online iterative adaptation. More broadly, ours is among the early work demonstrating language model coordination can be unlocked through RL, where powerful coordination strategies emerge naturally in LLMs through pure end-to-end reward maximization.</description>

      <title>Amortized Inference of Multi-Modal Posteriors using Likelihood-Weighted Normalizing Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel technique for amortized posterior estimation using Normalizing Flows trained with likelihood-weighted importance sampling. This approach allows for the efficient inference of theoretical parameters in high-dimensional inverse problems without the need for posterior training samples. We implement the method on multi-modal benchmark tasks in 2D and 3D to check for the efficacy. A critical observation of our study is the impact of the topology of the base distributions on the modelled posteriors. We find that standard unimodal base distributions fail to capture disconnected support, resulting in spurious probability bridges between modes. We demonstrate that initializing the flow with a Gaussian Mixture Model that matches the cardinality of the target modes significantly improves reconstruction fidelity, as measured by some distance and divergence metrics.</description>

      <title>Group Representational Position Encoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present GRAPE (Group Representational Position Encoding), a unified framework for positional encoding based on group actions. GRAPE unifies two families of mechanisms: (i) multiplicative rotations (Multiplicative GRAPE) in $\operatorname{SO}(d)$ and (ii) additive logit biases (Additive GRAPE) arising from unipotent actions in the general linear group $\mathrm{GL}$. In Multiplicative GRAPE, a position $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ (or $t \in \mathbb{R}$) acts as $\mathbf{G}(n) = \exp(n \, \omega \, \mathbf{L})$ with a rank-2 skew-symmetric generator $\mathbf{L} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$, yielding a relative, compositional, norm-preserving map with a closed-form matrix exponential. RoPE is recovered exactly when the $d/2$ planes correspond to canonical coordinate pairs with a log-uniform spectrum. Learned commuting subspaces and compact non-commuting mixtures strictly extend this geometry to capture cross-subspace feature coupling at $O(d)$ and $O(r d)$ cost per head, respectively. In Additive GRAPE, additive logits arise from rank-1 (or low-rank) unipotent actions, recovering ALiBi and the Forgetting Transformer (FoX) as exact special cases while preserving an exact relative law and streaming cacheability. Overall, GRAPE provides a principled design space for positional geometry in long-context models, subsuming RoPE and ALiBi as special cases.

      <title>Correction of Decoupled Weight Decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoupled weight decay, solely responsible for the performance advantage of AdamW over Adam, has long been set to proportional to learning rate $\gamma$ without questioning. Some researchers have recently challenged such assumption and argued that decoupled weight decay should be set $\propto \gamma^2$ instead based on orthogonality arguments at steady state. To the contrary, we find that eliminating the contribution of the perpendicular component of the update to the weight norm leads to little change to the training dynamics. Instead, we derive that decoupled weight decay $\propto \gamma^2$ results in stable weight norm based on the simple assumption that updates become independent of the weights at steady state, regardless of the nature of the optimizer. Based on the same assumption, we derive and empirically verify that the Total Update Contribution (TUC) of a minibatch under the Scion optimizer is better characterized by the momentum-dependent effective learning rate whose optimal value transfers and we show that decoupled weight decay $\propto \gamma^2$ leads to stable weight and gradient norms and allows us to better control the training dynamics and improve the model performance.</description>

      <title>Guided Transfer Learning for Discrete Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models (DMs) have achieved strong performance in language and other discrete domains, offering a compelling alternative to autoregressive modeling. Yet this performance typically depends on large training datasets, challenging the performance of DMs in small-data regimes -- common under real-world constraints. Aimed at this challenge, recent work in continuous DMs suggests that transfer learning via classifier ratio-based guidance can adapt a pretrained DM to a related target distribution, often outperforming alternatives such as full-weight fine-tuning on the target data. By contrast, transfer learning for discrete DMs remains unexplored. We address this gap by exploring practical analogues of ratio-based transfer learning for discrete DMs. Our theoretical analysis shows that a direct extension of existing ratio-based guidance is computationally prohibitive, scaling with vocabulary size. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a scheduling mechanism that yields a practical algorithm, Guided Transfer Learning for discrete diffusion models (GTL). GTL enables sampling from a target distribution without modifying the pretrained denoiser and reduces the cost to linear scaling in vocabulary size, which in turn supports longer sequence generation. We evaluate GTL on sequential data, including synthetic Markov chains and language modeling tasks, and provide a detailed empirical analysis of its behavior. The results highlight a clear trade-off: when target datasets are large, weight fine-tuning is often preferable, whereas GTL becomes increasingly effective as target data shrinks. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate a key failure mode of GTL: when the source and target distributions overlap poorly, the ratio-based classifier required for guidance becomes unreliable, limiting transfer performance.</description>

      <title>How Does Fourier Analysis Network Work? A Mechanism Analysis and a New Dual-Activation Layer Proposal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fourier Analysis Network (FAN) was recently proposed as a simple way to improve neural network performance by replacing part of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activations with sine and cosine functions. Although several studies have reported small but consistent gains across tasks, the underlying mechanism behind these improvements has remained unclear. In this work, we show that only the sine activation contributes positively to performance, whereas the cosine activation tends to be detrimental. Our analysis reveals that the improvement is not a consequence of the sine function's periodic nature; instead, it stems from the function's local behavior near x = 0, where its non-zero derivative mitigates the vanishing-gradient problem. We further show that FAN primarily alleviates the dying-ReLU problem, in which a neuron consistently receives negative inputs, produces zero gradients, and stops learning. Although modern ReLU-like activations, such as Leaky ReLU, GELU, and Swish, reduce ReLU's zero-gradient region, they still contain input domains where gradients remain significantly diminished, contributing to slower optimization and hindering rapid convergence. FAN addresses this limitation by introducing a more stable gradient pathway. This analysis shifts the understanding of FAN's benefits from a spectral interpretation to a concrete analysis of training dynamics, leading to the development of the Dual-Activation Layer (DAL), a more efficient convergence accelerator. We evaluate DAL on three tasks: classification of noisy sinusoidal signals versus pure noise, MNIST digit classification, and Electrocardiogram (ECG)-based biometric recognition. In all cases, DAL models converge faster and achieve equal or higher validation accuracy compared to models with conventional activations.</description>

      <title>Phase-space entropy at acquisition reflects downstream learnability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern learning systems work with data that vary widely across domains, but they all ultimately depend on how much structure is already present in the measurements before any model is trained. This raises a basic question: is there a general, modality-agnostic way to quantify how acquisition itself preserves or destroys the information that downstream learners could use? Here we propose an acquisition-level scalar $\Delta S_{\mathcal B}$ based on instrument-resolved phase space. Unlike pixelwise distortion or purely spectral errors that often saturate under aggressive undersampling, $\Delta S_{\mathcal B}$ directly quantifies how acquisition mixes or removes joint space--frequency structure at the instrument scale. We show theoretically that \(\Delta S_{\mathcal B}\) correctly identifies the phase-space coherence of periodic sampling as the physical source of aliasing, recovering classical sampling-theorem consequences. Empirically, across masked image classification, accelerated MRI, and massive MIMO (including over-the-air measurements), $|\Delta S_{\mathcal B}|$ consistently ranks sampling geometries and predicts downstream reconstruction/recognition difficulty \emph{without training}. In particular, minimizing $|\Delta S_{\mathcal B}|$ enables zero-training selection of variable-density MRI mask parameters that matches designs tuned by conventional pre-reconstruction criteria. These results suggest that phase-space entropy at acquisition reflects downstream learnability, enabling pre-training selection of candidate sampling policies and as a shared notion of information preservation across modalities.</description>

      <title>Communication-Corruption Coupling and Verification in Cooperative Multi-Objective Bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study cooperative stochastic multi-armed bandits with vector-valued rewards under adversarial corruption and limited verification. In each of $T$ rounds, each of $N$ agents selects an arm, the environment generates a clean reward vector, and an adversary perturbs the observed feedback subject to a global corruption budget $\Gamma$. Performance is measured by team regret under a coordinate-wise nondecreasing, $L$-Lipschitz scalarization $\phi$, covering linear, Chebyshev, and smooth monotone utilities. Our main contribution is a communication-corruption coupling: we show that a fixed environment-side budget $\Gamma$ can translate into an effective corruption level ranging from $\Gamma$ to $N\Gamma$, depending on whether agents share raw samples, sufficient statistics, or only arm recommendations. We formalize this via a protocol-induced multiplicity functional and prove regret bounds parameterized by the resulting effective corruption. As corollaries, raw-sample sharing can suffer an $N$-fold larger additive corruption penalty, whereas summary sharing and recommendation-only sharing preserve an unamplified $O(\Gamma)$ term and achieve centralized-rate team regret. We further establish information-theoretic limits, including an unavoidable additive $\Omega(\Gamma)$ penalty and a high-corruption regime $\Gamma=\Theta(NT)$ where sublinear regret is impossible without clean information. Finally, we characterize how a global budget $\nu$ of verified observations restores learnability. That is, verification is necessary in the high-corruption regime, and sufficient once it crosses the identification threshold, with certified sharing enabling the team's regret to become independent of $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>DeRaDiff: Denoising Time Realignment of Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances align diffusion models with human preferences to increase aesthetic appeal and mitigate artifacts and biases. Such methods aim to maximize a conditional output distribution aligned with higher rewards whilst not drifting far from a pretrained prior. This is commonly enforced by KL (Kullback Leibler) regularization. As such, a central issue still remains: how does one choose the right regularization strength? Too high of a strength leads to limited alignment and too low of a strength leads to "reward hacking". This renders the task of choosing the correct regularization strength highly non-trivial. Existing approaches sweep over this hyperparameter by aligning a pretrained model at multiple regularization strengths and then choose the best strength. Unfortunately, this is prohibitively expensive. We introduce DeRaDiff, a denoising time realignment procedure that, after aligning a pretrained model once, modulates the regularization strength during sampling to emulate models trained at other regularization strengths without any additional training or finetuning. Extending decoding-time realignment from language to diffusion models, DeRaDiff operates over iterative predictions of continuous latents by replacing the reverse step reference distribution by a geometric mixture of an aligned and reference posterior, thus giving rise to a closed form update under common schedulers and a single tunable parameter, lambda, for on the fly control. Our experiments show that across multiple text image alignment and image-quality metrics, our method consistently provides a strong approximation for models aligned entirely from scratch at different regularization strengths. Thus, our method yields an efficient way to search for the optimal strength, eliminating the need for expensive alignment sweeps and thereby substantially reducing computational costs.</description>

      <title>Probe-then-Commit Multi-Objective Bandits: Theoretical Benefits of Limited Multi-Arm Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an online resource-selection problem motivated by multi-radio access selection and mobile edge computing offloading. In each round, an agent chooses among $K$ candidate links/servers (arms) whose performance is a stochastic $d$-dimensional vector (e.g., throughput, latency, energy, reliability). The key interaction is \emph{probe-then-commit (PtC)}: the agent may probe up to $q&gt;1$ candidates via control-plane measurements to observe their vector outcomes, but must execute exactly one candidate in the data plane. This limited multi-arm feedback regime strictly interpolates between classical bandits ($q=1$) and full-information experts ($q=K$), yet existing multi-objective learning theory largely focuses on these extremes. We develop \textsc{PtC-P-UCB}, an optimistic probe-then-commit algorithm whose technical core is frontier-aware probing under uncertainty in a Pareto mode, e.g., it selects the $q$ probes by approximately maximizing a hypervolume-inspired frontier-coverage potential and commits by marginal hypervolume gain to directly expand the attained Pareto region. We prove a dominated-hypervolume frontier error of $\tilde{O} (K_P d/\sqrt{qT})$, where $K_P$ is the Pareto-frontier size and $T$ is the horizon, and scalarized regret $\tilde{O} (L_\phi d\sqrt{(K/q)T})$, where $\phi$ is the scalarizer. These quantify a transparent $1/\sqrt{q}$ acceleration from limited probing. We further extend to \emph{multi-modal probing}: each probe returns $M$ modalities (e.g., CSI, queue, compute telemetry), and uncertainty fusion yields variance-adaptive versions of the above bounds via an effective noise scale.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a reversible deep learning model for 13C NMR that uses a single conditional invertible neural network for both directions between molecular structures and spectra. The network is built from i-RevNet style bijective blocks, so the forward map and its inverse are available by construction. We train the model to predict a 128-bit binned spectrum code from a graph-based structure encoding, while the remaining latent dimensions capture residual variability. At inference time, we invert the same trained network to generate structure candidates from a spectrum code, which explicitly represents the one-to-many nature of spectrum-to-structure inference. On a filtered subset, the model is numerically invertible on trained examples, achieves spectrum-code prediction above chance, and produces coarse but meaningful structural signals when inverted on validation spectra. These results demonstrate that invertible architectures can unify spectrum prediction and uncertainty-aware candidate generation within one end-to-end model.</description>

      <title>Temporal Pair Consistency for Variance-Reduced Flow Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous-time generative models, such as diffusion models, flow matching, and rectified flow, learn time-dependent vector fields but are typically trained with objectives that treat timesteps independently, leading to high estimator variance and inefficient sampling. Prior approaches mitigate this via explicit smoothness penalties, trajectory regularization, or modified probability paths and solvers. We introduce Temporal Pair Consistency (TPC), a lightweight variance-reduction principle that couples velocity predictions at paired timesteps along the same probability path, operating entirely at the estimator level without modifying the model architecture, probability path, or solver. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that TPC induces a quadratic, trajectory-coupled regularization that provably reduces gradient variance while preserving the underlying flow-matching objective. Instantiated within flow matching, TPC improves sample quality and efficiency across CIFAR-10 and ImageNet at multiple resolutions, achieving lower FID at identical or lower computational cost than prior methods, and extends seamlessly to modern SOTA-style pipelines with noise-augmented training, score-based denoising, and rectified flow.</description>

      <title>Harpoon: Generalised Manifold Guidance for Conditional Tabular Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating tabular data under conditions is critical to applications requiring precise control over the generative process. Existing methods rely on training-time strategies that do not generalise to unseen constraints during inference, and struggle to handle conditional tasks beyond tabular imputation. While manifold theory offers a principled way to guide generation, current formulations are tied to specific inference-time objectives and are limited to continuous domains. We extend manifold theory to tabular data and expand its scope to handle diverse inference-time objectives. On this foundation, we introduce HARPOON, a tabular diffusion method that guides unconstrained samples along the manifold geometry to satisfy diverse tabular conditions at inference. We validate our theoretical contributions empirically on tasks such as imputation and enforcing inequality constraints, demonstrating HARPOON'S strong performance across diverse datasets and the practical benefits of manifold-aware guidance for tabular data.

      <title>Amortized Molecular Optimization via Group Relative Policy Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular design encompasses tasks ranging from de-novo design to structural alteration of given molecules or fragments. For the latter, state-of-the-art methods predominantly function as "Instance Optimizers'', expending significant compute restarting the search for every input structure. While model-based approaches theoretically offer amortized efficiency by learning a policy transferable to unseen structures, existing methods struggle to generalize. We identify a key failure mode: the high variance arising from the heterogeneous difficulty of distinct starting structures. To address this, we introduce GRXForm, adapting a pre-trained Graph Transformer model that optimizes molecules via sequential atom-and-bond additions. We employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for goal-directed fine-tuning to mitigate variance by normalizing rewards relative to the starting structure. Empirically, GRXForm generalizes to out-of-distribution molecular scaffolds without inference-time oracle calls or refinement, achieving scores in multi-objective optimization competitive with leading instance optimizers.</description>

      <title>FedPSA: Modeling Behavioral Staleness in Asynchronous Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) has emerged as a significant research area in recent years. By not waiting for slower clients and executing the training process concurrently, it achieves faster training speed compared to traditional federated learning. However, due to the staleness introduced by the asynchronous process, its performance may degrade in some scenarios. Existing methods often use the round difference between the current model and the global model as the sole measure of staleness, which is coarse-grained and lacks observation of the model itself, thereby limiting the performance ceiling of asynchronous methods. In this paper, we propose FedPSA (Parameter Sensitivity-based Asynchronous Federated Learning), a more fine-grained AFL framework that leverages parameter sensitivity to measure model obsolescence and establishes a dynamic momentum queue to assess the current training phase in real time, thereby adjusting the tolerance for outdated information dynamically. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and comparisons with various methods demonstrate the superior performance of FedPSA, achieving up to 6.37\% improvement over baseline methods and 1.93\% over the current state-of-the-art method.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Capability Emergence: Scale-Invariant Representation Collapse and Top-Down Reorganization in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Capability emergence during neural network training remains mechanistically opaque. We track five geometric measures across five model scales (405K-85M parameters), 120+ emergence events in eight algorithmic tasks, and three Pythia language models (160M-2.8B). We find: (1) training begins with a universal representation collapse to task-specific floors that are scale-invariant across a 210X parameter range (e.g., modular arithmetic collapses to RANKME $\approx$ 2.0 regardless of model size); (2) collapse propagates top-down through layers (32/32 task X model consistency), contradicting bottom-up feature-building intuition; (3) a geometric hierarchy in which representation geometry leads emergence (75-100% precursor rate for hard tasks), while the local learning coefficient is synchronous (0/24 precursor) and Hessian measures lag. We also delineate prediction limits: geometric measures encode coarse task difficulty but not fine-grained timing (within-class concordance 27%; when task ordering reverses across scales, prediction fails at 26%). On Pythia, global geometric patterns replicate but per-task precursor signals do not -- the precursor relationship requires task-training alignment that naturalistic pre-training does not provide. Our contribution is the geometric anatomy of emergence and its boundary conditions, not a prediction tool.</description>

      <title>Adam Improves Muon: Adaptive Moment Estimation with Orthogonalized Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient stochastic optimization typically integrates an update direction that performs well in the deterministic regime with a mechanism adapting to stochastic perturbations. While Adam uses adaptive moment estimates to promote stability, Muon utilizes the weight layers' matrix structure via orthogonalized momentum, showing superior performance in large language model training. We propose a new optimizer and a diagonal extension, NAMO and NAMO-D, providing the first principled integration of orthogonalized momentum with norm-based Adam-type noise adaptation. NAMO scales orthogonalized momentum using a single adaptive stepsize, preserving orthogonality while improving upon Muon at negligible additional cost. NAMO-D instead right-multiplies orthogonalized momentum by a diagonal matrix with clamped entries. This design enables neuron-wise noise adaptation and aligns with the common near block-diagonal Hessian structure. Under standard assumptions, we establish optimal convergence rates for both algorithms in the deterministic setting and show that, in the stochastic setting, their convergence guarantees adapt to the noise level of stochastic gradients. Experiments on pretraining GPT-2 models demonstrate improved performance of both NAMO and NAMO-D compared to the AdamW and Muon baselines, with NAMO-D achieving further gains over NAMO via an additional clamping hyperparameter that balances the competing goals of maintaining a well-conditioned update direction and leveraging fine-grained noise adaptation.</description>

      <title>Fair Community Detection and Structure Learning in Heterogeneous Graphical Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.05128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inference of community structure in probabilistic graphical models may not be consistent with fairness constraints when nodes have demographic attributes. Certain demographics may be over-represented in some detected communities and under-represented in others. This paper defines a novel $\ell_1$-regularized pseudo-likelihood approach for fair graphical model selection. In particular, we assume there is some community or clustering structure in the true underlying graph, and we seek to learn a sparse undirected graph and its communities from the data such that demographic groups are fairly represented within the communities. In the case when the graph is known a priori, we provide a convex semidefinite programming approach for fair community detection. We establish the statistical consistency of the proposed method for both a Gaussian graphical model and an Ising model for, respectively, continuous and binary data, proving that our method can recover the graphs and their fair communities with high probability.</description>

      <title>Learning Performance Maximizing Ensembles with Explainability Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a method for the optimal allocation of observations between an intrinsically explainable glass box model and a black box model. An optimal allocation being defined as one which, for any given explainability level (i.e. the proportion of observations for which the explainable model is the prediction function), maximizes the performance of the ensemble on the underlying task, and maximizes performance of the explainable model on the observations allocated to it, subject to the maximal ensemble performance condition. The proposed method is shown to produce such explainability optimal allocations on a benchmark suite of tabular datasets across a variety of explainable and black box model types. These learned allocations are found to consistently maintain ensemble performance at very high explainability levels (explaining $74\%$ of observations on average), and in some cases even outperforming both the component explainable and black box models while improving explainability.</description>

      <title>Governance of Generative Artificial Intelligence for Companies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08802v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), specifically large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, has swiftly entered organizations without adequate governance, posing both opportunities and risks. Despite extensive debate on GenAI's transformative potential and emerging regulatory measures, limited research addresses organizational governance from both technical and business perspectives. While frameworks for AI governance exist, it remains unclear to what extent they apply to GenAI. This review paper fills this gap by surveying recent literature to better understand the fundamental characteristics of GenAI and to adapt existing governance frameworks specifically to GenAI within organizations. To this end, it extends Nickerson's framework development process by incorporating prior conceptualizations. The resulting framework delineates scope, objectives, and governance mechanisms designed to both harness business opportunities and mitigate risks associated with GenAI integration. Overall, this research advances a focused approach to GenAI governance, offering practical guidance for companies navigating the challenges of GenAI adoption and highlighting research gaps.</description>

      <title>Topic Modeling with Fine-tuning LLMs and Bag of Sentences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for topic modeling, outperforming classical topic models such as LDA. Commonly, pre-trained LLM encoders such as BERT are used out-of-the-box despite the fact that fine-tuning is known to improve LLMs considerably. The challenge lies in obtaining a suitable labeled dataset for fine-tuning. In this paper, we build on the recent idea of using bags of sentences as the elementary unit for computing topics. Based on this idea, we derive an approach called FT-Topic to perform unsupervised fine-tuning, relying primarily on two steps for constructing a training dataset in an automatic fashion. First, a heuristic method identifies pairs of sentence groups that are assumed to belong either to the same topic or to different topics. Second, we remove sentence pairs that are likely labeled incorrectly. The resulting dataset is then used to fine-tune an encoder LLM, which can be leveraged by any topic modeling approach that uses embeddings. In this work, we demonstrate its effectiveness by deriving a novel state-of-the-art topic modeling method called SenClu. The method achieves fast inference through an expectation-maximization algorithm and hard assignments of sentence groups to a single topic, while allowing users to encode prior knowledge about the topic-document distribution.

      <title>Physics-informed graph neural networks for flow field estimation in carotid arteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hemodynamic quantities are valuable biomedical risk factors for cardiovascular pathology such as atherosclerosis. Non-invasive, in-vivo measurement of these quantities can only be performed using a select number of modalities that are not widely available, such as 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this work, we create a surrogate model for hemodynamic flow field estimation, powered by machine learning. We train graph neural networks that include priors about the underlying symmetries and physics, limiting the amount of data required for training. This allows us to train the model using moderately-sized, in-vivo 4D flow MRI datasets, instead of large in-silico datasets obtained by computational fluid dynamics (CFD), as is the current standard. We create an efficient, equivariant neural network by combining the popular PointNet++ architecture with group-steerable layers. To incorporate the physics-informed priors, we derive an efficient discretisation scheme for the involved differential operators. We perform extensive experiments in carotid arteries and show that our model can accurately estimate low-noise hemodynamic flow fields in the carotid artery. Moreover, we show how the learned relation between geometry and hemodynamic quantities transfers to 3D vascular models obtained using a different imaging modality than the training data. This shows that physics-informed graph neural networks can be trained using 4D flow MRI data to estimate blood flow in unseen carotid artery geometries.</description>

      <title>Beyond Mimicry to Contextual Guidance: Knowledge Distillation for Interactive AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models increasingly mediate firm - customer interactions, firms face a tradeoff: the most capable models perform well but are costly and difficult to control at scale. Existing knowledge distillation methods address this challenge by training weaker, deployable models to imitate frontier outputs; however, such open-loop approaches are poorly suited to interactive, multi-turn settings where responses must be sequenced coherently across conversational states. We propose a shift in what knowledge is distilled - from output imitation to contextual guidance. We develop a framework in which a superior teacher model constructs a reusable library of strategic textual guidance for particular scenarios likely to be encountered by the student. When deployed, the student retrieves the context-specific guidance at inference time, enabling adaptive behavior without retraining. Using customer-service interactions, we show that this approach improves service quality and customer satisfaction relative to standard fine-tuning while maintaining alignment with firm policies. The results position inference-time textual guidance as a scalable and controllable approach to distillation for interactive AI agents in marketing settings.</description>

      <title>An AI-powered Bayesian generative modeling approach for causal inference in observational studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00755v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal inference in observational studies with high-dimensional covariates presents significant challenges. We introduce CausalBGM, an AI-powered Bayesian generative modeling approach that captures the causal relationship among covariates, treatment, and outcome. The core innovation is to estimate the individual treatment effect (ITE) by learning the individual-specific distribution of a low-dimensional latent feature set (e.g., latent confounders) that drives changes in both treatment and outcome. This individualized posterior representation yields estimates of the individual treatment effect (ITE) together with well-calibrated posterior intervals while mitigating confounding effect. CausalBGM is fitted through an iterative algorithm to update the model parameters and the latent features until convergence. This framework leverages the power of AI to capture complex dependencies among variables while adhering to the Bayesian principles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CausalBGM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with high-dimensional covariates and large-scale datasets. By addressing key limitations of existing methods, CausalBGM emerges as a robust and promising framework for advancing causal inference in a wide range of modern applications. The code for CausalBGM is available at https://github.com/liuq-lab/bayesgm. The document for using CausalBGM is available at https://bayesgm.readthedocs.io.</description>

      <title>CAIMAN: Causal Action Influence Detection for Sample-efficient Loco-manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enabling legged robots to perform non-prehensile loco-manipulation is crucial for enhancing their versatility. Learning behaviors such as whole-body object pushing often requires sophisticated planning strategies or extensive task-specific reward shaping, especially in unstructured environments. In this work, we present CAIMAN, a practical reinforcement learning framework that encourages the agent to gain control over other entities in the environment. CAIMAN leverages causal action influence as an intrinsic motivation objective, allowing legged robots to efficiently acquire object pushing skills even under sparse task rewards. We employ a hierarchical control strategy, combining a low-level locomotion module with a high-level policy that generates task-relevant velocity commands and is trained to maximize the intrinsic reward. To estimate causal action influence, we learn the dynamics of the environment by integrating a kinematic prior with data collected during training. We empirically demonstrate CAIMAN's superior sample efficiency and adaptability to diverse scenarios in simulation, as well as its successful transfer to real-world systems without further fine-tuning.

      <title>Deep Generative model that uses physical quantities to generate and retrieve solar magnetic active regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05351</link>

Abstract: Deep generative models have shown immense potential in generating unseen data that has properties of real data. These models learn complex data-generating distributions starting from a smaller set of latent dimensions. However, generative models have encountered great skepticism in scientific domains due to the disconnection between generative latent vectors and scientifically relevant quantities. In this study, we integrate three types of machine learning models to generate solar magnetic patches in a physically interpretable manner and use those as a query to find matching patches in real observations. We use the magnetic field measurements from Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARPs) to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We connect the physical properties of GAN-generated images with their latent vectors to train Support Vector Machines (SVMs) that do mapping between physical and latent spaces. These produce directions in the GAN latent space along which known physical parameters of the SHARPs change. We train a self-supervised learner (SSL) to make queries with generated images and find matches from real data. We find that the GAN-SVM combination enables users to produce high-quality patches that change smoothly only with a prescribed physical quantity, making generative models physically interpretable. We also show that GAN outputs can be used to retrieve real data that shares the same physical properties as the generated query. This elevates Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) from a means-to-produce artificial data to a novel tool for scientific data interrogation, supporting its applicability beyond the domain of heliophysics.</description>

      <title>A Pragmatic Note on Evaluating Generative Models with Fr\'echet Inception Distance for Retinal Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), computed with an ImageNet pretrained Inception-v3 network, is widely used as a state-of-the-art evaluation metric for generative models. It assumes that feature vectors from Inception-v3 follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution and calculates the 2-Wasserstein distance based on their means and covariances. While FID effectively measures how closely synthetic data match real data in many image synthesis tasks, the primary goal in biomedical generative models is often to enrich training datasets ideally with corresponding annotations. For this purpose, the gold standard for evaluating generative models is to incorporate synthetic data into downstream task training, such as classification and segmentation, to pragmatically assess its performance. In this paper, we examine cases from retinal imaging modalities, including color fundus photography and optical coherence tomography, where FID and its related metrics misalign with task-specific evaluation goals in classification and segmentation. We highlight the limitations of using various metrics, represented by FID and its variants, as evaluation criteria for these applications and address their potential caveats in broader biomedical imaging modalities and downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>The influence of missing data mechanisms and simple missing data handling techniques on fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms permeate the day-to-day aspects of our lives and therefore studying the fairness of these algorithms before implementation is crucial. One way in which bias can manifest in a dataset is through missing values. Missing data are often assumed to be missing completely randomly; in reality the propensity of data being missing is often tied to the demographic characteristics of individuals. There is limited research into how missing values and the handling thereof can impact the fairness of an algorithm. Most researchers either apply listwise deletion or tend to use simpler methods of imputation (e.g. mean or mode) compared to more advanced approaches (e.g. multiple imputation). This study considers the fairness of various classification algorithms after a range of missing data handling strategies is applied. Missing values are generated (i.e. amputed) in three popular datasets for classification fairness, by creating a high percentage of missing values using three missing data mechanisms. The results show that the missing data mechanism does not significantly impact fairness; across the missing data handling techniques listwise deletion gives the highest fairness on average and amongst the classification algorithms random forests leads to the highest fairness on average. The interaction effect of the missing data handling technique and the classification algorithm is also often significant.</description>

      <title>CAE: Repurposing the Critic as an Explorer in Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploration remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning, as many existing methods either lack theoretical guarantees or fall short in practical effectiveness. In this paper, we propose CAE, i.e., the Critic as an Explorer, a lightweight approach that repurposes the value networks in standard deep RL algorithms to drive exploration, without introducing additional parameters. CAE leverages multi-armed bandit techniques combined with a tailored scaling strategy, enabling efficient exploration with provable sub-linear regret bounds and strong empirical stability. Remarkably, it is simple to implement, requiring only about 10 lines of code. For complex tasks where learning reliable value networks is difficult, we introduce CAE+, an extension of CAE that incorporates an auxiliary network. CAE+ increases the parameter count by less than 1% while preserving implementation simplicity, adding roughly 10 additional lines of code. Extensive experiments on MuJoCo, MiniHack, and Habitat validate the effectiveness of CAE and CAE+, highlighting their ability to unify theoretical rigor with practical efficiency.</description>

      <title>ConformalNL2LTL: Translating Natural Language Instructions into Temporal Logic Formulas with Conformal Correctness Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is a widely used task specification language for autonomous systems. To mitigate the significant manual effort and expertise required to define LTL-encoded tasks, several methods have been proposed for translating Natural Language (NL) instructions into LTL formulas, which, however, lack correctness guarantees. To address this, we propose a new NL-to-LTL translation method, called ConformalNL2LTL that achieves user-defined translation success rates on unseen NL commands. Our method constructs LTL formulas iteratively by solving a sequence of open-vocabulary question-answering (QA) problems using large language models (LLMs). These QA tasks are handled collaboratively by a primary and an auxiliary model. The primary model answers each QA instance while quantifying uncertainty via conformal prediction; when it is insufficiently certain according to user-defined confidence thresholds, it requests assistance from the auxiliary model and, if necessary, from the user. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that ConformalNL2LTL achieves the desired translation accuracy while minimizing user intervention.</description>

      <title>A False Sense of Privacy: Evaluating Textual Data Sanitization Beyond Surface-level Privacy Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21035v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sanitizing sensitive text data typically involves removing personally identifiable information (PII) or generating synthetic data under the assumption that these methods adequately protect privacy; however, their effectiveness is often only assessed by measuring the leakage of explicit identifiers but ignoring nuanced textual markers that can lead to re-identification. We challenge the above illusion of privacy by proposing a new framework that evaluates re-identification attacks to quantify individual privacy risks upon data release. Our approach shows that seemingly innocuous auxiliary information -- such as routine social activities -- can be used to infer sensitive attributes like age or substance use history from sanitized data. For instance, we demonstrate that Azure's commercial PII removal tool fails to protect 74\% of information in the MedQA dataset. Although differential privacy mitigates these risks to some extent, it significantly reduces the utility of the sanitized text for downstream tasks. Our findings indicate that current sanitization techniques offer a \textit{false sense of privacy}, highlighting the need for more robust methods that protect against semantic-level information leakage.</description>

      <title>Learning hidden cascades via classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11228v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spreading dynamics in social networks are often studied under the assumption that individuals' statuses, whether informed or infected, are fully observable. However, in many real-world situations, such statuses remain unobservable, which is crucial for determining an individual's potential to further spread the infection. While final statuses are hidden, intermediate indicators such as symptoms of infection are observable and provide useful representations of the underlying diffusion process. We propose a partial observability-aware Machine Learning framework to learn the characteristics of the spreading model. We term the method Distribution Classification, which utilizes the power of classifiers to infer the underlying transmission dynamics. Through extensive benchmarking against Approximate Bayesian Computation and GNN-based baselines, our framework consistently outperforms these state-of-the-art methods, delivering accurate parameter estimates across diverse diffusion settings while scaling efficiently to large networks. We validate the method on synthetic networks and extend the study to a real-world insider trading network, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing spreading phenomena where direct observation of individual statuses is not possible.</description>

      <title>Multi-View Wireless Sensing via Conditional Generative Learning: Framework and Model Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we incorporate physical knowledge into learning-based high-precision target sensing using the multi-view channel state information (CSI) between multiple base stations (BSs) and user equipment (UEs). Such kind of multi-view sensing problem can be naturally cast into a conditional generation framework. To this end, we design a bipartite neural network architecture, the first part of which uses an elaborately designed encoder to fuse the latent target features embedded in the multi-view CSI, and then the second uses them as conditioning inputs of a powerful generative model to guide the target's reconstruction. Specifically, the encoder is designed to capture the physical correlation between the CSI and the target, and also be adaptive to the numbers and positions of BS-UE pairs. Therein the view-specific nature of CSI is assimilated by introducing a spatial positional embedding scheme, which exploits the structure of electromagnetic(EM)-wave propagation channels. Finally, a conditional diffusion model with a weighted loss is employed to generate the target's point cloud from the fused features. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that the proposed generative multi-view (Gen-MV) sensing framework exhibits excellent flexibility and significant performance improvement on the reconstruction quality of target's shape and EM properties.</description>

      <title>Synthetic History: Evaluating Visual Representations of the Past in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Text-to-Image (TTI) diffusion models become increasingly influential in content creation, growing attention is being directed toward their societal and cultural implications. While prior research has primarily examined demographic and cultural biases, the ability of these models to accurately represent historical contexts remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a benchmark for evaluating how TTI models depict historical contexts. The benchmark combines HistVis, a dataset of 30,000 synthetic images generated by three state-of-the-art diffusion models from carefully designed prompts covering universal human activities across multiple historical periods, with a reproducible evaluation protocol. We evaluate generated imagery across three key aspects: (1) Implicit Stylistic Associations: examining default visual styles associated with specific eras; (2) Historical Consistency: identifying anachronisms such as modern artifacts in pre-modern contexts; and (3) Demographic Representation: comparing generated racial and gender distributions against historically plausible baselines. Our findings reveal systematic inaccuracies in historically themed generated imagery, as TTI models frequently stereotype past eras by incorporating unstated stylistic cues, introduce anachronisms, and fail to reflect plausible demographic patterns. By providing a reproducible benchmark for historical representation in generated imagery, this work provides an initial step toward building more historically accurate TTI models.</description>

      <title>AstroMLab 4: Benchmark-Topping Performance in Astronomy Q&amp;A with a 70B-Parameter Domain-Specialized Reasoning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General-purpose large language models (LLMs), despite their broad capabilities, often struggle with specialized domain knowledge. This gap hinders their deployment as reliable research agents in demanding fields such as astronomy. Building on our prior work with AstroSage-Llama-3.1-8B, this study introduces AstroSage-Llama-3.1-70B, a 70-billion parameter domain-specialized natural-language AI assistant. It is designed for research and education across astronomy, astrophysics, space science, astroparticle physics, cosmology, and astronomical instrumentation. Developed from the Meta-Llama-3.1-70B foundation, AstroSage-Llama-3.1-70B underwent extensive continued pre-training (CPT) on a vast corpus of astronomical literature, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and model merging. We integrated reasoning chains into the SFT dataset, enabling AstroSage-Llama-3.1-70B to either answer the user query immediately, or first emit a human-readable thought process. Evaluated on a validated subset of 3,846 questions from the AstroMLab-1 benchmark (Ting et al., 2024) -- derived from literature withheld during training -- AstroSage-Llama-3.1-70B achieves top-tier performance (89.0%), matching GPT-5.2, Claude-4.5-Opus, and Gemini-3-Pro while being more cost-efficient. This work demonstrates that domain specialization, when applied to large-scale models, can enable them to outperform generalist counterparts in specialized knowledge areas like astronomy, thereby advancing the frontier of AI capabilities in the field.</description>

      <title>View Invariant Learning for Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08831v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE), where an agent follows instructions and moves freely to reach a destination, is a key research problem in embodied AI. However, most existing approaches are sensitive to viewpoint changes, i.e. variations in camera height and viewing angle. Here we introduce a more general scenario, V$^2$-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints) and propose a view-invariant post-training framework, called VIL (View Invariant Learning), that makes existing navigation policies more robust to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant features. We also introduce a teacher-student framework for the Waypoint Predictor Module, a standard part of VLNCE baselines, where a view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these components. Empirical results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on V$^2$-VLNCE by 8-15\% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Evaluation of VIL in standard VLNCE settings shows that despite being trained for varied viewpoints, VIL often still improves performance. On the harder RxR-CE dataset, our method also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training method. We further evaluate VIL for simulated camera placements derived from real robot configurations (e.g. Stretch RE-1, LoCoBot), showing consistent improvements of performance. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept real-robot evaluation in two physical environments using a panoramic RGB sensor combined with LiDAR. The code is available at https://github.com/realjoshqsun/V2-VLNCE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with deformed Wigner random matrices. These matrices are closely related to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): weight matrices of trained DNNs could be represented in the form $R + S$, where $R$ is random and $S$ is highly correlated. The spectrum of such matrices plays a key role in rigorous underpinning of the novel pruning technique based on Random Matrix Theory. In practice, the spectrum of the matrix $S$ can be rather complicated. In this paper, we develop an asymptotic analysis for the case of full rank $S$ with increasing number of outlier eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Nearly Minimax Discrete Distribution Estimation in Kullback-Leibler Divergence with High Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the fundamental problem of estimating a discrete distribution on a domain of size $K$ with high probability in Kullback-Leibler divergence. We provide upper and lower bounds on the minimax estimation rate, which show that the optimal rate is between $\big(K + \ln(K)\ln(1/\delta)\big) /n$ and $\big(K\ln\ln(K) + \ln(K)\ln(1/\delta)\big) /n$ at error probability $\delta$ and sample size $n$, which pins down the rate up to the doubly logarithmic factor $\ln \ln K$ that multiplies $K$. Our upper bound uses techniques from online learning to construct a novel estimator via online-to-batch conversion. Perhaps surprisingly, the tail behavior of the minimax rate is worse than for the squared total variation and squared Hellinger distance, for which it is $\big(K + \ln(1/\delta)\big) /n$, i.e. without the $\ln K$ multiplying $\ln (1/\delta)$. As a consequence, we cannot obtain a fully tight lower bound from the usual reduction to these smaller distances. Moreover, we show that this lower bound cannot be achieved by the standard lower bound approach based on a reduction to hypothesis testing, and instead we need to introduce a new reduction to what we call weak hypothesis testing. We investigate the source of the gap with other divergences further in refined results, which show that the total variation rate is achievable for Kullback-Leibler divergence after all (in fact by he maximum likelihood estimator) if we rule out outcome probabilities smaller than $O(\ln(K/\delta) / n)$, which is a vanishing set as $n$ increases for fixed $K$ and $\delta$. This explains why minimax Kullback-Leibler estimation is more difficult than asymptotic estimation.</description>

      <title>ViGText: Deepfake Image Detection with Vision-Language Model Explanations and Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes. Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes, helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.</description>

      <title>Share Your Attention: Transformer Weight Sharing via Matrix-based Dictionary Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized AI applications, yet their high computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment. Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g., low-rank approximation or attention pruning), while the repetitive layered structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by dictionary learning in convolutional networks, we propose a framework for structured weight sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection matrices (Q, K, V, O) into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's parameters by 66.7\% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement-trained with standard optimizers - and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than GQA, low-rank baselines and recent Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT), MASA matches performance metrics on image classification tasks with 66.7\% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we investigate the possibility of employing MASA on large pretrained models to reduce their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their performance.</description>

      <title>Ensemble-based graph representation of fMRI data for cognitive brain state classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: fMRI is a non-invasive technique for investigating brain activity, offering high-resolution insights into neural processes. Understanding and decoding cognitive brain states from fMRI depends on how functional interactions are represented. We propose an ensemble-based graph representation in which each edge weight encodes state evidence as the difference between posterior probabilities of two states, estimated by an ensemble of edge-wise probabilistic classifiers from simple pairwise time-series features. We evaluate the method on seven task-fMRI paradigms from the Human Connectome Project, performing binary classification within each paradigm. Using compact node summaries (mean incident edge weights) and logistic regression, we obtain average accuracies of 97.07-99.74 %. We further compare ensemble graphs with conventional correlation graphs using the same graph neural network classifier; ensemble graphs consistently yield higher accuracy (88.00-99.42 % vs 61.86-97.94 % across tasks). Because edge weights have a probabilistic, state-oriented interpretation, the representation supports connection- and region-level interpretability and can be extended to multiclass decoding, regression, other neuroimaging modalities, and clinical classification.</description>

      <title>A Novel Method to Determine Total Oxidant Concentration Produced by Non-Thermal Plasma Based on Image Processing and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of total oxidant concentration [Ox]tot in nonthermal plasma treated aqueous systems remains a critical challenge due to the transient nature of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and the subjectivity of conventional titration methods used for [Ox]tot determination. This study introduces a color based computer analysis method that integrates advanced image processing with machine learning to quantify colorimetric changes in potassium iodide solutions during oxidation. A custom built visual acquisition system recorded high resolution video of the color transitions occurring during plasma treatment while the change in oxidant concentration was simultaneously monitored using a standard titrimetric method. Extracted image frames were processed through a structured pipeline to obtain RGB, HSV, and Lab color features. Statistical analysis revealed strong linear relationships between selected color features and measured oxidant concentrations, particularly for HSV saturation, Lab a and b channels, and the blue component of RGB. These features were subsequently used to train and validate multiple machine learning models including linear regression, ridge regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and neural networks. Linear regression and gradient boosting demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy with R2 values exceeding 0.99. Dimensionality reduction from nine features to smaller feature subsets preserved predictive performance while improving computational efficiency. Comparison with experimental titration measurements showed that the proposed system predicts total oxidant concentration in potassium iodide solution with very high accuracy, achieving R2 values above 0.998 even under reduced feature conditions.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks vs. Physics Models for Non-Invasive Glucose Monitoring: A Comparative Study Under Noise-Stressed Synthetic Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-invasive glucose monitoring outside controlled settings is dominated by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): hardware drift, environmental variation, and physiology suppress the glucose signature in NIR signals. We present a noise-stressed NIR simulator that injects 12-bit ADC quantisation, LED drift, photodiode dark noise, temperature/humidity variation, contact-pressure noise, Fitzpatrick I-VI melanin, and glucose variability to create a low-correlation regime (rho_glucose-NIR = 0.21). Using this platform, we benchmark six methods: Enhanced Beer-Lambert (physics-engineered ridge regression), Original PINN, Optimised PINN, RTE-inspired PINN, Selective RTE PINN, and a shallow DNN. The physics-engineered Beer Lambert model achieves the lowest error (13.6 mg/dL RMSE) with only 56 parameters and 0.01 ms inference, outperforming deeper PINNs and the SDNN baseline under low-SNR conditions. The study reframes the task as noise suppression under weak signal and shows that carefully engineered physics features can outperform higher-capacity models in this regime.</description>

      <title>On the Adversarial Robustness of Learning-based Conformal Novelty Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00463v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the adversarial robustness of conformal novelty detection. In particular, we focus on two powerful learning-based frameworks that come with finite-sample false discovery rate (FDR) control: one is AdaDetect (by Marandon et al., 2024) that is based on the positive-unlabeled classifier, and the other is a one-class classifier-based approach (by Bates et al., 2023). While they provide rigorous statistical guarantees under benign conditions, their behavior under adversarial perturbations remains underexplored. We first formulate an oracle attack setup, under the AdaDetect formulation, that quantifies the worst-case degradation of FDR, deriving an upper bound that characterizes the statistical cost of attacks. This idealized formulation directly motivates a practical and effective attack scheme that only requires query access to the output labels of both frameworks. Coupling these formulations with two popular and complementary black-box adversarial algorithms, we systematically evaluate the vulnerability of both frameworks on synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results show that adversarial perturbations can significantly increase the FDR while maintaining high detection power, exposing fundamental limitations of current error-controlled novelty detection methods and motivating the development of more robust alternatives.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Neural Networks for Functional ANOVA model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for interpretability in machine learning, functional ANOVA decomposition has gained renewed attention as a principled tool for breaking down high-dimensional function into low-dimensional components that reveal the contributions of different variable groups. Recently, Tensor Product Neural Network (TPNN) has been developed and applied as basis functions in the functional ANOVA model, referred to as ANOVA-TPNN. A disadvantage of ANOVA-TPNN, however, is that the components to be estimated must be specified in advance, which makes it difficult to incorporate higher-order TPNNs into the functional ANOVA model due to computational and memory constraints. In this work, we propose Bayesian-TPNN, a Bayesian inference procedure for the functional ANOVA model with TPNN basis functions, enabling the detection of higher-order components with reduced computational cost compared to ANOVA-TPNN. We develop an efficient MCMC algorithm and demonstrate that Bayesian-TPNN performs well by analyzing multiple benchmark datasets. Theoretically, we prove that the posterior of Bayesian-TPNN is consistent.</description>

      <title>Incomplete Multi-view Clustering via Hierarchical Semantic Alignment and Cooperative Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13887v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incomplete multi-view data, where certain views are entirely missing for some samples, poses significant challenges for traditional multi-view clustering methods. Existing deep incomplete multi-view clustering approaches often rely on static fusion strategies or two-stage pipelines, leading to suboptimal fusion results and error propagation issues. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel incomplete multi-view clustering framework based on Hierarchical Semantic Alignment and Cooperative Completion (HSACC). HSACC achieves robust cross-view fusion through a dual-level semantic space design. In the low-level semantic space, consistency alignment is ensured by maximizing mutual information across views. In the high-level semantic space, adaptive view weights are dynamically assigned based on the distributional affinity between individual views and an initial fused representation, followed by weighted fusion to generate a unified global representation. Additionally, HSACC implicitly recovers missing views by projecting aligned latent representations into high-dimensional semantic spaces and jointly optimizes reconstruction and clustering objectives, enabling cooperative learning of completion and clustering. Experimental results demonstrate that HSACC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the hierarchical alignment and dynamic weighting mechanisms, while parameter analysis confirms the model's robustness to hyperparameter variations.

      <title>The Minimax Lower Bound of Kernel Stein Discrepancy Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel Stein discrepancies (KSDs) have emerged as a powerful tool for quantifying goodness-of-fit over the last decade, featuring numerous successful applications. To the best of our knowledge, all existing KSD estimators with known rate achieve $\sqrt n$-convergence. In this work, we present two complementary results (with different proof strategies), establishing that the minimax lower bound of KSD estimation is $n^{-1/2}$ and settling the optimality of these estimators. Our first result focuses on KSD estimation on $\mathbb R^d$ with the Langevin-Stein operator; our explicit constant for the Gaussian kernel indicates that the difficulty of KSD estimation may increase exponentially with the dimensionality $d$. Our second result settles the minimax lower bound for KSD estimation on general domains.</description>

      <title>The Oversight Game: Learning to Cooperatively Balance an AI Agent's Safety and Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety challenge is how to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We study a minimal control interface in which an agent chooses whether to act autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses whether to be permissive (trust) or engage in oversight (oversee), and model this interaction as a two-player Markov game. When this game forms a Markov Potential Game, we prove an alignment guarantee: any increase in the agent's utility from acting more autonomously cannot decrease the human's value. This establishes a form of intrinsic alignment where the agent's incentive to seek autonomy is structurally coupled to the human's welfare. Practically, the framework induces a transparent control layer that encourages the agent to defer when risky and act when safe. While we use gridworld simulations to illustrate the emergence of this collaboration, our primary validation involves an agentic tool-use task in which two 30B parameter language models are fine-tuned via independent policy gradient. We demonstrate that even as the agents learn to coordinate on the fly, this framework effectively reduces safety violations in realistic, open-ended environments.</description>

      <title>Online Smoothed Demand Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a class of online problems called online smoothed demand management $(\texttt{OSDM})$, motivated by paradigm shifts in grid integration and energy storage for large energy consumers such as data centers. In $\texttt{OSDM}$, an operator makes two decisions at each time step: an amount of energy to be purchased, and an amount of energy to be delivered (i.e., used for computation). The difference between these decisions charges (or discharges) the operator's energy storage (e.g., a battery). Two types of demand arrive online: base demand, which must be covered at the current time, and flexible demand, which can be satisfied at any time before a demand-specific deadline $\Delta_t$. The operator's goal is to minimize a cost (subject to above constraints) that combines a cost of purchasing energy, a cost for delivering energy (if applicable), and smoothness penalties on the purchasing and delivery rates to discourage fluctuations and encourage ``grid healthy'' decisions. $\texttt{OSDM}$ generalizes several problems in the online algorithms literature while being the first to fully model applications of interest. We propose a competitive algorithm for $\texttt{OSDM}$ called $\texttt{PAAD}$ (partitioned accounting &amp; aggregated decisions) and show it achieves the optimal competitive ratio. To overcome the pessimism typical of worst-case analysis, we also propose a novel learning framework that provides guarantees on the worst-case competitive ratio (i.e., to provide robustness against nonstationarity) while allowing end-to-end differentiable learning of the best algorithm on historical instances of the problem. We evaluate our algorithms in a case study of a grid-integrated data center with battery storage, showing that $\texttt{PAAD}$ effectively solves the problem and end-to-end learning achieves substantial performance improvements compared to $\texttt{PAAD}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an all-at-once modeling framework for learning systems of ordinary differential equations (ODE) from scarce, partial, and noisy observations of the states. The proposed methodology amounts to a combination of sparse recovery strategies for the ODE over a function library combined with techniques from reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) theory for estimating the state and discretizing the ODE. Our numerical experiments reveal that the proposed strategy leads to significant gains in terms of accuracy, sample efficiency, and robustness to noise, both in terms of learning the equation and estimating the unknown states. This work demonstrates capabilities well beyond existing and widely used algorithms while extending the modeling flexibility of other recent developments in equation discovery.</description>

      <title>AI Epidemiology: achieving explainable AI through expert oversight patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI Epidemiology is a framework for governing and explaining advanced AI systems by applying population-level surveillance methods to AI outputs. The approach mirrors the way in which epidemiologists enable public health interventions through statistical evidence before molecular mechanisms are understood. This bypasses the problem of model complexity which plagues current interpretability methods (such as SHAP and mechanistic interpretability) at the scale of deployed models.
  AI Epidemiology achieves this population-level surveillance by standardising capture of AI-expert interactions into structured assessment fields: risk level, alignment score, and accuracy score. These function as exposure variables which predict output failure through statistical associations, much like cholesterol and blood pressure act as exposure variables predicting cardiac events. Output-failure associations are subsequently validated against expert overrides and real-world outcomes.
  The framework places zero burden on experts and provides automatic audit trails by passively tracking expert convergence and divergence with AI recommendations. Since it analyses outputs rather than internal model computations, it also provides governance continuity when institutions update models and switch vendors. Finally, by providing reliability scores and semantic assessments (e.g. 'this recommendation resembles 500 cases overridden by experts due to guideline violations'), it enables experts and institutions to detect unreliable AI outputs before they cause harm. This democratises AI oversight by enabling domain experts to govern AI systems without requiring machine learning expertise.</description>

      <title>Simplex Deep Linear Discriminant Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit Deep Linear Discriminant Analysis (Deep LDA) from a likelihood-based perspective. While classical LDA is a simple Gaussian model with linear decision boundaries, attaching an LDA head to a neural encoder raises the question of how to train the resulting deep classifier by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). We first show that end-to-end MLE training of an unconstrained Deep LDA model ignores discrimination: when both the LDA parameters and the encoder parameters are learned jointly, the likelihood admits a degenerate solution in which some of the class clusters may heavily overlap or even collapse, and classification performance deteriorates. Batchwise moment re-estimation of the LDA parameters does not remove this failure mode. We then propose a constrained Deep LDA formulation that fixes the class means to the vertices of a regular simplex in the latent space and restricts the shared covariance to be spherical, leaving only the priors and a single variance parameter to be learned along with the encoder. Under these geometric constraints, MLE becomes stable and yields well-separated class clusters in the latent space. On images (Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and texts (AG News, CLINC150), the resulting Deep LDA models achieve accuracy competitive with softmax baselines while offering a simple, interpretable latent geometry that is clearly visible in two-dimensional projections.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cluster workload allocation often requires complex configurations, creating a usability gap. This paper introduces a semantic, intent-driven scheduling paradigm for cluster systems using Natural Language Processing. The system employs a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated via a Kubernetes scheduler extender to interpret natural language allocation hint annotations for soft affinity preferences. A prototype featuring a cluster state cache and an intent analyzer (using AWS Bedrock) was developed. Empirical evaluation demonstrated high LLM parsing accuracy (&gt;95% Subset Accuracy on an evaluation ground-truth dataset) for top-tier models like Amazon Nova Pro/Premier and Mistral Pixtral Large, significantly outperforming a baseline engine. Scheduling quality tests across six scenarios showed the prototype achieved superior or equivalent placement compared to standard Kubernetes configurations, particularly excelling in complex and quantitative scenarios and handling conflicting soft preferences. The results validate using LLMs for accessible scheduling but highlight limitations like synchronous LLM latency, suggesting asynchronous processing for production readiness. This work confirms the viability of semantic soft affinity for simplifying workload orchestration and presents a proof-of-concept design.</description>

      <title>Alignment Pretraining: AI Discourse Causes Self-Fulfilling (Mis)alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pretraining corpora contain extensive discourse about AI systems, yet the causal influence of this discourse on downstream alignment remains poorly understood. If prevailing descriptions of AI behaviour are predominantly negative, LLMs may internalise corresponding behavioural priors, giving rise to self-fulfilling misalignment. This paper provides the first controlled study of this hypothesis by pretraining 6.9B-parameter LLMs with varying amounts of (mis)alignment discourse. We find that discussion of AI contributes to misalignment. Upsampling synthetic training documents about AI misalignment leads to a notable increase in misaligned behaviour. Conversely, upsampling documents about aligned behaviour reduces misalignment scores from 45% to 9%. We consider this evidence of self-fulfilling alignment. These effects are dampened, but persist through post-training. Our findings establish the study of how pretraining data shapes alignment priors, or alignment pretraining, as a complement to post-training. We recommend practitioners consider pretraining for alignment alongside capabilities. We share our models, data, and evaluations at AlignmentPretraining.ai.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking at the Edge of Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly saturate new benchmarks shortly after they are published, benchmarking itself is at a juncture: if frontier models keep improving, it will become increasingly hard for humans to generate discriminative tasks, provide accurate ground-truth answers, or evaluate complex solutions. If benchmarking becomes infeasible, our ability to measure any progress in AI is at stake. We refer to this scenario as the post-comprehension regime. In this work, we propose Critique-Resilient Benchmarking, an adversarial framework designed to compare models even when full human understanding is infeasible. Our technique relies on the notion of critique-resilient correctness: an answer is deemed correct if no adversary has convincingly proved otherwise. Unlike standard benchmarking, humans serve as bounded verifiers and focus on localized claims, which preserves evaluation integrity beyond full comprehension of the task. Using an itemized bipartite Bradley-Terry model, we jointly rank LLMs by their ability to solve challenging tasks and to generate difficult yet solvable questions. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in the mathematical domain across eight frontier LLMs, showing that the resulting scores are stable and correlate with external capability measures. Our framework reformulates benchmarking as an adversarial generation-evaluation game in which humans serve as final adjudicators.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Vision-Language Segmentation for Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel uncertainty-aware multimodal segmentation framework that leverages both radiological images and associated clinical text for precise medical diagnosis. We propose a Modality Decoding Attention Block (MoDAB) with a lightweight State Space Mixer (SSMix) to enable efficient cross-modal fusion and long-range dependency modelling. To guide learning under ambiguity, we propose the Spectral-Entropic Uncertainty (SEU) Loss, which jointly captures spatial overlap, spectral consistency, and predictive uncertainty in a unified objective. In complex clinical circumstances with poor image quality, this formulation improves model reliability. Extensive experiments on various publicly available medical datasets, QATA-COVID19, MosMed++, and Kvasir-SEG, demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation performance while being significantly more computationally efficient than existing State-of-the-Art (SoTA) approaches. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating uncertainty modelling and structured modality alignment in vision-language medical segmentation tasks.

      <title>LongAudio-RAG: Event-Grounded Question Answering over Multi-Hour Long Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-duration audio is increasingly common in industrial and consumer settings, yet reviewing multi-hour recordings is impractical, motivating systems that answer natural-language queries with precise temporal grounding and minimal hallucination. Existing audio-language models show promise, but long-audio question answering remains difficult due to context-length limits. We introduce LongAudio-RAG (LA-RAG), a hybrid framework that grounds Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in retrieved, timestamped acoustic event detections rather than raw audio. Multi-hour streams are converted into structured event records stored in an SQL database, and at inference time the system resolves natural-language time references, classifies intent, retrieves only the relevant events, and generates answers using this constrained evidence. To evaluate performance, we construct a synthetic long-audio benchmark by concatenating recordings with preserved timestamps and generating template-based question-answer pairs for detection, counting, and summarization tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach by deploying it in a hybrid edge-cloud environment, where the audio grounding model runs on-device on IoT-class hardware while the LLM is hosted on a GPU-backed server. This architecture enables low-latency event extraction at the edge and high-quality language reasoning in the cloud. Experiments show that structured, event-level retrieval significantly improves accuracy compared to vanilla Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or text-to-SQL approaches.</description>

      <title>LGQ: Learning Discretization Geometry for Scalable and Stable Image Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete image tokenization is a key bottleneck for scalable visual generation: a tokenizer must remain compact for efficient latent-space priors while preserving semantic structure and using discrete capacity effectively. Existing quantizers face a trade-off: vector-quantized tokenizers learn flexible geometries but often suffer from biased straight-through optimization, codebook under-utilization, and representation collapse at large vocabularies. Structured scalar or implicit tokenizers ensure stable, near-complete utilization by design, yet rely on fixed discretization geometries that may allocate capacity inefficiently under heterogeneous latent statistics.
  We introduce Learnable Geometric Quantization (LGQ), a discrete image tokenizer that learns discretization geometry end-to-end. LGQ replaces hard nearest-neighbor lookup with temperature-controlled soft assignments, enabling fully differentiable training while recovering hard assignments at inference. The assignments correspond to posterior responsibilities of an isotropic Gaussian mixture and minimize a variational free-energy objective, provably converging to nearest-neighbor quantization in the low-temperature limit. LGQ combines a token-level peakedness regularizer with a global usage regularizer to encourage confident yet balanced code utilization without imposing rigid grids.
  Under a controlled VQGAN-style backbone on ImageNet across multiple vocabulary sizes, LGQ achieves stable optimization and balanced utilization. At 16K codebook size, LGQ improves rFID by 11.88% over FSQ while using 49.96% fewer active codes, and improves rFID by 6.06% over SimVQ with 49.45% lower effective representation rate, achieving comparable fidelity with substantially fewer active entries.

      <title>EnterpriseBench Corecraft: Training Generalizable Agents on High-Fidelity RL Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that training AI agents on high-fidelity reinforcement learning environments produces capabilities that generalize beyond the training distribution. We introduce CoreCraft, the first environment in EnterpriseBench, Surge AI's suite of agentic RL environments. CoreCraft is a fully operational enterprise simulation of a customer support organization, comprising over 2,500 entities across 14 entity types with 23 unique tools, designed to measure whether AI agents can perform the multi-step, domain-specific work that real jobs demand. Frontier models such as GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.6 solve fewer than 30% of tasks when all expert-authored rubric criteria must be satisfied. Using this environment, we train GLM 4.6 with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and adaptive clipping. After a single epoch of training, the model improves from 25.37% to 36.76% task pass rate on held-out evaluation tasks. More importantly, these gains transfer to out-of-distribution benchmarks: +4.5% on BFCL Parallel, +7.4% on Tau2-Bench Retail, and +6.8% on Tool Decathlon (Pass@1). We believe three environment properties are consistent with the observed transfer: task-centric world building that optimizes for diverse, challenging tasks; expert-authored rubrics enabling reliable reward computation; and enterprise workflows that reflect realistic professional patterns. Our results suggest that environment quality, diversity, and realism are key factors enabling generalizable agent capabilities.</description>

      <title>MALLVI: A Multi-Agent Framework for Integrated Generalized Robotics Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Task planning for robotic manipulation with large language models (LLMs) is an emerging area. Prior approaches rely on specialized models, fine tuning, or prompt tuning, and often operate in an open loop manner without robust environmental feedback, making them fragile in dynamic settings.MALLVi present a Multi Agent Large Language and Vision framework that enables closed loop feedback driven robotic manipulation. Given a natural language instruction and an image of the environment, MALLVi generates executable atomic actions for a robot manipulator. After action execution, a Vision Language Model (VLM) evaluates environmental feedback and decides whether to repeat the process or proceed to the next step Rather than using a single model, MALLVi coordinates specialized agents, Decomposer, Localizer, Thinker, and Reflector, to manage perception, localization, reasoning, and high level planning. An optional Descriptor agent provides visual memory of the initial state. The Reflector supports targeted error detection and recovery by reactivating only relevant agents, avoiding full replanning.Experiments in simulation and real world settings show that iterative closed loop multi agent coordination improves generalization and increases success rates in zero shot manipulation tasks.Code available at https://github.com/iman1234ahmadi/MALLVI.</description>

      <title>LLM-WikiRace Benchmark: How Far Can LLMs Plan over Real-World Knowledge Graphs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce LLM-Wikirace, a benchmark for evaluating planning, reasoning, and world knowledge in large language models (LLMs). In LLM-Wikirace, models must efficiently navigate Wikipedia hyperlinks step by step to reach a target page from a given source, requiring look-ahead planning and the ability to reason about how concepts are connected in the real world. We evaluate a broad set of open- and closed-source models, including Gemini-3, GPT-5, and Claude Opus 4.5, which achieve the strongest results on the easy level of the task and demonstrate superhuman performance. Despite this, performance drops sharply on hard difficulty: the best-performing model, Gemini-3, succeeds in only 23\% of hard games, highlighting substantial remaining challenges for frontier models. Our analysis shows that world knowledge is a necessary ingredient for success, but only up to a point, beyond this threshold, planning and long-horizon reasoning capabilities become the dominant factors. Trajectory-level analysis further reveals that even the strongest models struggle to replan after failure, frequently entering loops rather than recovering. LLM-Wikirace is a simple benchmark that reveals clear limitations in current reasoning systems, offering an open arena where planning-capable LLMs still have much to prove.
