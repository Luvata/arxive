      <title>Do the Right Thing, Just Debias! Multi-Category Bias Mitigation Using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of building robust and generalizable bias mitigation models for language. Recognizing the limitations of existing datasets, we introduce ANUBIS, a novel dataset with 1507 carefully curated sentence pairs encompassing nine social bias categories. We evaluate state-of-the-art models like T5, utilizing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Learning (PPO, DPO), and In-Context Learning (ICL) for effective bias mitigation. Our analysis focuses on multi-class social bias reduction, cross-dataset generalizability, and environmental impact of the trained models. ANUBIS and our findings offer valuable resources for building more equitable AI systems and contribute to the development of responsible and unbiased technologies with broad societal impact.</description>

      <title>RISCORE: Enhancing In-Context Riddle Solving in Language Models through Context-Reconstructed Example Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Riddle-solving requires advanced reasoning skills, pushing LLMs to engage in abstract thinking and creative problem-solving, often revealing limitations in their cognitive abilities. In this paper, we examine the riddle-solving capabilities of LLMs using a multiple-choice format, exploring how different prompting techniques impact performance on riddles that demand diverse reasoning skills. To enhance results, we introduce RISCORE (RIddle Solving with COntext REcontruciton) a novel fully automated prompting method that generates and utilizes contextually reconstructed sentence-based puzzles in conjunction with the original examples to create few-shot exemplars. Our experiments demonstrate that RISCORE significantly improves the performance of language models in both vertical and lateral thinking tasks, surpassing traditional exemplar selection strategies across a variety of few-shot settings.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey of Bias in LLMs: Current Landscape and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) have revolutionized various applications in natural language processing (NLP) by providing unprecedented text generation, translation, and comprehension capabilities. However, their widespread deployment has brought to light significant concerns regarding biases embedded within these models. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of biases in LLMs, aiming to provide an extensive review of the types, sources, impacts, and mitigation strategies related to these biases. We systematically categorize biases into several dimensions. Our survey synthesizes current research findings and discusses the implications of biases in real-world applications. Additionally, we critically assess existing bias mitigation techniques and propose future research directions to enhance fairness and equity in LLMs. This survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers concerned with addressing and understanding biases in LLMs.</description>

      <title>FMDLlama: Financial Misinformation Detection based on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of social media has made the spread of misinformation easier. In the financial domain, the accuracy of information is crucial for various aspects of financial market, which has made financial misinformation detection (FMD) an urgent problem that needs to be addressed. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various fields. However, current studies mostly rely on traditional methods and have not explored the application of LLMs in the field of FMD. The main reason is the lack of FMD instruction tuning datasets and evaluation benchmarks. In this paper, we propose FMDLlama, the first open-sourced instruction-following LLMs for FMD task based on fine-tuning Llama3.1 with instruction data, the first multi-task FMD instruction dataset (FMDID) to support LLM instruction tuning, and a comprehensive FMD evaluation benchmark (FMD-B) with classification and explanation generation tasks to test the FMD ability of LLMs. We compare our models with a variety of LLMs on FMD-B, where our model outperforms all other open-sourced LLMs as well as ChatGPT.</description>

      <title>Strategies for Improving NL-to-FOL Translation with LLMs: Data Generation, Incremental Fine-Tuning, and Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logical reasoning is a fundamental task in natural language processing that presents significant challenges to Large Language Models (LLMs). The inherent characteristics of logical reasoning makes it well-suited for symbolic representations such as first-order logic (FOL). Research in symbolic logical reasoning explored FOL generation using state-of-the-art LLMs (i.e., GPT-4) to produce FOL translations of natural language (NL) statements, but errors in translation are usually not the focus. We address this by categorizing the translation errors in FOL statements generated by LLMs. To make progress towards improving the quality of FOL translations for smaller language models such as LLaMA-2 13B and Mistral 7B, we create ProofFOL, a high-quality FOL-annotated subset of ProofWriter dataset using GPT-4o. The models fine-tuned on this silver standard data achieve a significant gain in performance when compared to larger language models such as LLaMA-2 70B. In addition to improving the model using large data, we also tackle the issue of data scarcity and introduce an incremental framework encompassing of data augmentation and verification steps. In the augmentation process, a single pair of (premises, conclusion) is split into multiple new instances based on the predicates and FOLs. This data is used for fine-tuning, and the inference on this model generates FOLs with fewer errors over the model trained on the original data. Our investigation on the translation errors leads to generation of a perturbation dataset, which is used to train a verifier that corrects potential syntactic and semantic FOL translation errors. We demonstrate an efficient method for making the most of a limited existing human-annotated dataset. Our results show state-of-the-art performance for ProofWriter and ProntoQA datasets using ProofFOL on LLaMA-2 and Mistral models.</description>

      <title>Spelling Correction through Rewriting of Non-Autoregressive ASR Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models, recognizing personal or rare phrases can be hard. A promising way to improve accuracy is through spelling correction (or rewriting) of the ASR lattice, where potentially misrecognized phrases are replaced with acoustically similar and contextually relevant alternatives. However, rewriting is challenging for ASR models trained with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) due to noisy hypotheses produced by a non-autoregressive, context-independent beam search.
  We present a finite-state transducer (FST) technique for rewriting wordpiece lattices generated by Transformer-based CTC models. Our algorithm performs grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion directly from wordpieces into phonemes, avoiding explicit word representations and exploiting the richness of the CTC lattice. Our approach requires no retraining or modification of the ASR model. We achieved up to a 15.2% relative reduction in sentence error rate (SER) on a test set with contextually relevant entities.</description>

      <title>Exploring Knowledge Tracing in Tutor-Student Dialogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tutoring chatbots, showing promise in providing broad access to high-quality personalized education. Existing works have primarily studied how to make LLMs follow tutoring principles but not how to model student behavior in dialogues. However, analyzing student dialogue turns can serve as a formative assessment, since open-ended student discourse may indicate their knowledge levels and reveal specific misconceptions. In this work, we present a first attempt at performing knowledge tracing (KT) in tutor-student dialogues. We propose LLM prompting methods to identify the knowledge components/skills involved in each dialogue turn and diagnose whether the student responds correctly to the tutor, and verify the LLM's effectiveness via an expert human evaluation. We then apply a range of KT methods on the resulting labeled data to track student knowledge levels over an entire dialogue. We conduct experiments on two tutoring dialogue datasets, and show that a novel yet simple LLM-based method, LLMKT, significantly outperforms existing KT methods in predicting student response correctness in dialogues. We perform extensive qualitative analyses to highlight the challenges in dialogue KT and outline multiple avenues for future work.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Cognitive Complexity in Language Elicited by Product Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Product images (e.g., a phone) can be used to elicit a diverse set of consumer-reported features expressed through language, including surface-level perceptual attributes (e.g., "white") and more complex ones, like perceived utility (e.g., "battery"). The cognitive complexity of elicited language reveals the nature of cognitive processes and the context required to understand them; cognitive complexity also predicts consumers' subsequent choices. This work offers an approach for measuring and validating the cognitive complexity of human language elicited by product images, providing a tool for understanding the cognitive processes of human as well as virtual respondents simulated by Large Language Models (LLMs). We also introduce a large dataset that includes diverse descriptive labels for product images, including human-rated complexity. We demonstrate that human-rated cognitive complexity can be approximated using a set of natural language models that, combined, roughly capture the complexity construct. Moreover, this approach is minimally supervised and scalable, even in use cases with limited human assessment of complexity.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Questions from Query Generation for Task-Adaptive Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of information retrieval, to adapt to unseen tasks. Existing work generates synthetic queries from domain-specific documents to jointly train the retriever. However, the conventional query generator assumes the query as a question, thus failing to accommodate general search intents. A more lenient approach incorporates task-adaptive elements, such as few-shot learning with an 137B LLM. In this paper, we challenge a trend equating query and question, and instead conceptualize query generation task as a "compilation" of high-level intent into task-adaptive query. Specifically, we propose EGG, a query generator that better adapts to wide search intents expressed in the BeIR benchmark. Our method outperforms baselines and existing models on four tasks with underexplored intents, while utilizing a query generator 47 times smaller than the previous state-of-the-art. Our findings reveal that instructing the LM with explicit search intent is a key aspect of modeling an effective query generator.</description>

      <title>Overview of the First Shared Task on Clinical Text Generation: RRG24 and "Discharge Me!"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in natural language generation have tremendous implications for healthcare. For instance, state-of-the-art systems could automate the generation of sections in clinical reports to alleviate physician workload and streamline hospital documentation. To explore these applications, we present a shared task consisting of two subtasks: (1) Radiology Report Generation (RRG24) and (2) Discharge Summary Generation ("Discharge Me!"). RRG24 involves generating the 'Findings' and 'Impression' sections of radiology reports given chest X-rays. "Discharge Me!" involves generating the 'Brief Hospital Course' and 'Discharge Instructions' sections of discharge summaries for patients admitted through the emergency department. "Discharge Me!" submissions were subsequently reviewed by a team of clinicians. Both tasks emphasize the goal of reducing clinician burnout and repetitive workloads by generating documentation. We received 201 submissions from across 8 teams for RRG24, and 211 submissions from across 16 teams for "Discharge Me!".</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Enhancing Large Language Models for Novelty Assessment in Scholarly Publications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have evaluated the creativity/novelty of large language models (LLMs) primarily from a semantic perspective, using benchmarks from cognitive science. However, accessing the novelty in scholarly publications is a largely unexplored area in evaluating LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a scholarly novelty benchmark (SchNovel) to evaluate LLMs' ability to assess novelty in scholarly papers. SchNovel consists of 15000 pairs of papers across six fields sampled from the arXiv dataset with publication dates spanning 2 to 10 years apart. In each pair, the more recently published paper is assumed to be more novel. Additionally, we propose RAG-Novelty, which simulates the review process taken by human reviewers by leveraging the retrieval of similar papers to assess novelty. Extensive experiments provide insights into the capabilities of different LLMs to assess novelty and demonstrate that RAG-Novelty outperforms recent baseline models.</description>

      <title>Claim-Guided Textual Backdoor Attack for Practical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing and the increased use of large language models have exposed new security vulnerabilities, such as backdoor attacks. Previous backdoor attacks require input manipulation after model distribution to activate the backdoor, posing limitations in real-world applicability. Addressing this gap, we introduce a novel Claim-Guided Backdoor Attack (CGBA), which eliminates the need for such manipulations by utilizing inherent textual claims as triggers. CGBA leverages claim extraction, clustering, and targeted training to trick models to misbehave on targeted claims without affecting their performance on clean data. CGBA demonstrates its effectiveness and stealthiness across various datasets and models, significantly enhancing the feasibility of practical backdoor attacks. Our code and data will be available at https://github.com/PaperCGBA/CGBA.</description>

      <title>Training Language Models to Win Debates with Self-Play Improves Judge Accuracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test the robustness of debate as a method of scalable oversight by training models to debate with data generated via self-play. In a long-context reading comprehension task, we find that language model based evaluators answer questions more accurately when judging models optimized to win debates. By contrast, we find no such relationship for consultancy models trained to persuade a judge without an opposing debater present. In quantitative and qualitative comparisons between our debate models and novel consultancy baselines, we find evidence that debate training encourages stronger and more informative arguments, showing promise that it can help provide high-quality supervision for tasks that are difficult to directly evaluate.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Do speakers of different languages talk differently about what they see? Behavioural and cognitive studies report cultural effects on perception; however, these are mostly limited in scope and hard to replicate. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of cross-lingual variation in image descriptions. Using a multimodal dataset with 31 languages and images from diverse locations, we develop a method to accurately identify entities mentioned in captions and present in the images, then measure how they vary across languages. Our analysis reveals that pairs of languages that are geographically or genetically closer tend to mention the same entities more frequently. We also identify entity categories whose saliency is universally high (such as animate beings), low (clothing accessories) or displaying high variance across languages (landscape). In a case study, we measure the differences in a specific language pair (e.g., Japanese mentions clothing far more frequently than English). Furthermore, our method corroborates previous small-scale studies, including 1) Rosch et al. (1976)'s theory of basic-level categories, demonstrating a preference for entities that are neither too generic nor too specific, and 2) Miyamoto et al. (2006)'s hypothesis that environments afford patterns of perception, such as entity counts. Overall, our work reveals the presence of both universal and culture-specific patterns in entity mentions.</description>

      <title>Domain-Independent Automatic Generation of Descriptive Texts for Time-Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to scarcity of time-series data annotated with descriptive texts, training a model to generate descriptive texts for time-series data is challenging. In this study, we propose a method to systematically generate domain-independent descriptive texts from time-series data. We identify two distinct approaches for creating pairs of time-series data and descriptive texts: the forward approach and the backward approach. By implementing the novel backward approach, we create the Temporal Automated Captions for Observations (TACO) dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that a contrastive learning based model trained using the TACO dataset is capable of generating descriptive texts for time-series data in novel domains.</description>

      <title>Pre-trained Language Models Return Distinguishable Probability Distributions to Unfaithfully Hallucinated Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we show the pre-trained language models return distinguishable generation probability and uncertainty distribution to unfaithfully hallucinated texts, regardless of their size and structure. By examining 24 models on 6 data sets, we find out that 88-98% of cases return statistically significantly distinguishable generation probability and uncertainty distributions. Using this general phenomenon, we showcase a hallucination-reducing training algorithm. Our algorithm outperforms other baselines by achieving higher faithfulness metrics while maintaining sound general text quality measures.</description>

      <title>A Character-Centric Creative Story Generation via Imagination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creative story generation with diverse and detailed story elements is a long-standing goal for large language models. While existing methodologies generate long and coherent stories, they fall significantly short of human capabilities in terms of diversity and character detail. To address this, we introduce a novel story generation framework called CCI (Character-centric Creative story generation via Imagination). CCI features two innovative modules for creative story generation: IG (Image-Guided Imagination) and MW (Multi-Writer model). In the IG module, we utilize DALL-E 3 to create visual representations of key story elements. The IG generates more novel and concrete characters, backgrounds, and main plots than text-only methods. The MW module uses these story elements created by IG to generate multiple description candidates for the protagonist and select the best one. This method incorporates vivid and rich character descriptions into the story. We compared the stories generated by CCI and baseline models through human evaluation and statistical analysis. The results showed significant improvements in the creativity. Furthermore, by enabling interactive multi-modal story generation with users, we have opened up possibilities for human-LLM integration in cultural development.</description>

      <title>Topic-aware Causal Intervention for Counterfactual Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual statements, which describe events that did not or cannot take place, are beneficial to numerous NLP applications. Hence, we consider the problem of counterfactual detection (CFD) and seek to enhance the CFD models. Previous models are reliant on clue phrases to predict counterfactuality, so they suffer from significant performance drop when clue phrase hints do not exist during testing. Moreover, these models tend to predict non-counterfactuals over counterfactuals. To address these issues, we propose to integrate neural topic model into the CFD model to capture the global semantics of the input statement. We continue to causally intervene the hidden representations of the CFD model to balance the effect of the class labels. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art CFD and bias-resolving methods in both the CFD and other bias-sensitive tasks.</description>

      <title>SWE2: SubWord Enriched and Significant Word Emphasized Framework for Hate Speech Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hate speech detection on online social networks has become one of the emerging hot topics in recent years. With the broad spread and fast propagation speed across online social networks, hate speech makes significant impacts on society by increasing prejudice and hurting people. Therefore, there are aroused attention and concern from both industry and academia. In this paper, we address the hate speech problem and propose a novel hate speech detection framework called SWE2, which only relies on the content of messages and automatically identifies hate speech. In particular, our framework exploits both word-level semantic information and sub-word knowledge. It is intuitively persuasive and also practically performs well under a situation with/without character-level adversarial attack. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves 0.975 accuracy and 0.953 macro F1, outperforming 7 state-of-the-art baselines under no adversarial attack. Our model robustly and significantly performed well under extreme adversarial attack (manipulation of 50% messages), achieving 0.967 accuracy and 0.934 macro F1.</description>

      <title>SynTQA: Synergistic Table-based Question Answering via Mixture of Text-to-SQL and E2E TQA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL parsing and end-to-end question answering (E2E TQA) are two main approaches for Table-based Question Answering task. Despite success on multiple benchmarks, they have yet to be compared and their synergy remains unexplored. In this paper, we identify different strengths and weaknesses through evaluating state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets: Text-to-SQL demonstrates superiority in handling questions involving arithmetic operations and long tables; E2E TQA excels in addressing ambiguous questions, non-standard table schema, and complex table contents. To combine both strengths, we propose a Synergistic Table-based Question Answering approach that integrate different models via answer selection, which is agnostic to any model types. Further experiments validate that ensembling models by either feature-based or LLM-based answer selector significantly improves the performance over individual models.</description>

      <title>Probing Omissions and Distortions in Transformer-based RDF-to-Text Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Natural Language Generation (NLG), important information is sometimes omitted in the output text. To better understand and analyse how this type of mistake arises, we focus on RDF-to-Text generation and explore two methods of probing omissions in the encoder output of BART (Lewis et al, 2020) and of T5 (Raffel et al, 2019): (i) a novel parameter-free probing method based on the computation of cosine similarity between embeddings of RDF graphs and of RDF graphs in which we removed some entities and (ii) a parametric probe which performs binary classification on the encoder embeddings to detect omitted entities. We also extend our analysis to distorted entities, i.e. entities that are not fully correctly mentioned in the generated text (e.g. misspelling of entity, wrong units of measurement). We found that both omitted and distorted entities can be probed in the encoder's output embeddings. This suggests that the encoder emits a weaker signal for these entities and therefore is responsible for some loss of information. This also shows that probing methods can be used to detect mistakes in the output of NLG models.</description>

      <title>PMSS: Pretrained Matrices Skeleton Selection for LLM Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have recently gained much interest due to their ability to avoid excessive inference costs. However, LoRA still encounters the following challenges: (1) Limitation of low-rank assumption; and (2) Its initialization method may be suboptimal. To this end, we propose PMSS(Pre-trained Matrices Skeleton Selection), which enables high-rank updates with low costs while leveraging semantic and linguistic information inherent in pre-trained weight. It achieves this by selecting skeletons from the pre-trained weight matrix and only learning a small matrix instead. Experiments demonstrate that PMSS outperforms LoRA and other fine-tuning methods across tasks with much less trainable parameters. We demonstrate its effectiveness, especially in handling complex tasks such as DROP benchmark(+3.4%/+5.9% on LLaMA2-7B/13B) and math reasoning(+12.89%/+5.61%/+3.11% on LLaMA2-7B, Mistral-7B and Gemma-7B of GSM8K). The code and model will be released soon.</description>

      <title>RoleBreak: Character Hallucination as a Jailbreak Attack in Role-Playing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Role-playing systems powered by large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly influential in emotional communication applications. However, these systems are susceptible to character hallucinations, where the model deviates from predefined character roles and generates responses that are inconsistent with the intended persona. This paper presents the first systematic analysis of character hallucination from an attack perspective, introducing the RoleBreak framework. Our framework identifies two core mechanisms-query sparsity and role-query conflict-as key factors driving character hallucination. Leveraging these insights, we construct a novel dataset, RoleBreakEval, to evaluate existing hallucination mitigation techniques. Our experiments reveal that even enhanced models trained to minimize hallucination remain vulnerable to attacks. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose a novel defence strategy, the Narrator Mode, which generates supplemental context through narration to mitigate role-query conflicts and improve query generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that Narrator Mode significantly outperforms traditional refusal-based strategies by reducing hallucinations, enhancing fidelity to character roles and queries, and improving overall narrative coherence.</description>

      <title>E-SQL: Direct Schema Linking via Question Enrichment in Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Translating Natural Language Queries into Structured Query Language (Text-to-SQL or NLQ-to-SQL) is a critical task extensively studied by both the natural language processing and database communities, aimed at providing a natural language interface to databases (NLIDB) and lowering the barrier for non-experts. Despite recent advancements made through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), significant challenges remain. These include handling complex database schemas, resolving ambiguity in user queries, and generating SQL queries with intricate structures that accurately reflect the user's intent. In this work, we introduce E-SQL, a novel pipeline specifically designed to address these challenges through direct schema linking and candidate predicate augmentation. E-SQL enhances the natural language query by incorporating relevant database items (i.e., tables, columns, and values) and conditions directly into the question, bridging the gap between the query and the database structure. The pipeline leverages candidate predicate augmentation to mitigate erroneous or incomplete predicates in generated SQLs. We further investigate the impact of schema filtering, a technique widely explored in previous work, and demonstrate its diminishing returns when applied alongside advanced large language models. Comprehensive evaluations on the BIRD benchmark illustrate that E-SQL achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling in complex queries with a 66.29% execution accuracy on the test set. All code required to reproduce the reported results is publicly available on our GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Holistic Automated Red Teaming for Large Language Models through Top-Down Test Case Generation and Multi-turn Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated red teaming is an effective method for identifying misaligned behaviors in large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches, however, often focus primarily on improving attack success rates while overlooking the need for comprehensive test case coverage. Additionally, most of these methods are limited to single-turn red teaming, failing to capture the multi-turn dynamics of real-world human-machine interactions. To overcome these limitations, we propose HARM (Holistic Automated Red teaMing), which scales up the diversity of test cases using a top-down approach based on an extensible, fine-grained risk taxonomy. Our method also leverages a novel fine-tuning strategy and reinforcement learning techniques to facilitate multi-turn adversarial probing in a human-like manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework enables a more systematic understanding of model vulnerabilities and offers more targeted guidance for the alignment process.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the Bias of Large Language Model Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a trend of evaluating the Large Language Model (LLM) quality in the flavor of LLM-as-a-Judge, namely leveraging another LLM to evaluate the current output quality. However, existing judges are proven to be biased, namely they would favor answers which present better superficial quality (such as verbosity, fluency) while ignoring the instruction following ability. In this work, we propose systematic research about the bias of LLM-as-a-Judge. Specifically, for closed-source judge models, we apply calibration to mitigate the significance of superficial quality, both on probability level and prompt level. For open-source judge models, we propose to mitigate the bias by contrastive training, with curated negative samples that deviate from instruction but present better superficial quality. We apply our methods on the bias evaluation benchmark, and experiment results show our methods mitigate the bias by a large margin while maintaining a satisfactory evaluation accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Few Hypocrites: Few-Shot Learning and Subtype Definitions for Detecting Hypocrisy Accusations in Online Climate Change Debates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The climate crisis is a salient issue in online discussions, and hypocrisy accusations are a central rhetorical element in these debates. However, for large-scale text analysis, hypocrisy accusation detection is an understudied tool, most often defined as a smaller subtask of fallacious argument detection. In this paper, we define hypocrisy accusation detection as an independent task in NLP, and identify different relevant subtypes of hypocrisy accusations. Our Climate Hypocrisy Accusation Corpus (CHAC) consists of 420 Reddit climate debate comments, expert-annotated into two different types of hypocrisy accusations: personal versus political hypocrisy. We evaluate few-shot in-context learning with 6 shots and 3 instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) for detecting hypocrisy accusations in this dataset. Results indicate that the GPT-4o and Llama-3 models in particular show promise in detecting hypocrisy accusations (F1 reaching 0.68, while previous work shows F1 of 0.44). However, context matters for a complex semantic concept such as hypocrisy accusations, and we find models struggle especially at identifying political hypocrisy accusations compared to personal moral hypocrisy. Our study contributes new insights in hypocrisy detection and climate change discourse, and is a stepping stone for large-scale analysis of hypocrisy accusation in online climate debates.</description>

      <title>CodeInsight: A Curated Dataset of Practical Coding Solutions from Stack Overflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel dataset tailored for code generation, aimed at aiding developers in common tasks. Our dataset provides examples that include a clarified intent, code snippets associated, and an average of three related unit tests. It encompasses a range of libraries such as \texttt{Pandas}, \texttt{Numpy}, and \texttt{Regex}, along with more than 70 standard libraries in Python code derived from Stack Overflow. Comprising 3,409 crafted examples by Python experts, our dataset is designed for both model finetuning and standalone evaluation. To complete unit tests evaluation, we categorize examples in order to get more fine grained analysis, enhancing the understanding of models' strengths and weaknesses in specific coding tasks. The examples have been refined to reduce data contamination, a process confirmed by the performance of three leading models: Mistral 7B, CodeLLaMa 13B, and Starcoder 15B. We further investigate data-contamination testing GPT-4 performance on a part of our dataset. The benchmark can be accessed at \url{https://github.com/NathanaelBeau/CodeInsight}.</description>

      <title>Shifting from endangerment to rebirth in the Artificial Intelligence Age: An Ensemble Machine Learning Approach for Hawrami Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hawrami, a dialect of Kurdish, is classified as an endangered language as it suffers from the scarcity of data and the gradual loss of its speakers. Natural Language Processing projects can be used to partially compensate for data availability for endangered languages/dialects through a variety of approaches, such as machine translation, language model building, and corpora development. Similarly, NLP projects such as text classification are in language documentation. Several text classification studies have been conducted for Kurdish, but they were mainly dedicated to two particular dialects: Sorani (Central Kurdish) and Kurmanji (Northern Kurdish). In this paper, we introduce various text classification models using a dataset of 6,854 articles in Hawrami labeled into 15 categories by two native speakers. We use K-nearest Neighbor (KNN), Linear Support Vector Machine (Linear SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Decision Tree (DT) to evaluate how well those methods perform the classification task. The results indicate that the Linear SVM achieves a 96% of accuracy and outperforms the other approaches.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Temporal Sensitivity and Reasoning for Time-Sensitive Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-Sensitive Question Answering (TSQA) demands the effective utilization of specific temporal contexts, encompassing multiple time-evolving facts, to address time-sensitive questions. This necessitates not only the parsing of temporal information within questions but also the identification and understanding of time-evolving facts to generate accurate answers. However, current large language models still have limited sensitivity to temporal information and their inadequate temporal reasoning capabilities.In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances temporal awareness and reasoning through Temporal Information-Aware Embedding and Granular Contrastive Reinforcement Learning. Experimental results on four TSQA datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing LLMs in TSQA tasks, marking a step forward in bridging the performance gap between machine and human temporal understanding and reasoning.</description>

      <title>Pruning Multilingual Large Language Models for Multilingual Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual large language models (MLLMs), trained on multilingual balanced data, demonstrate better zero-shot learning performance in non-English languages compared to large language models trained on English-dominant data. However, the disparity in performance between English and non-English languages remains a challenge yet to be fully addressed. A distinctive characteristic of MLLMs is their high-quality translation capabilities, indicating an acquired proficiency in aligning between languages. This study explores how to enhance the zero-shot performance of MLLMs in non-English languages by leveraging their alignment capability between English and non-English languages. To achieve this, we first analyze the behavior of MLLMs when performing translation and reveal that there are large magnitude features that play a critical role in the translation process. Inspired by these findings, we retain the weights associated with operations involving the large magnitude features and prune other weights to force MLLMs to rely on these features for tasks beyond translation. We empirically demonstrate that this pruning strategy can enhance the MLLMs' performance in non-English language.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Detection of LLM-Generated Text using Token Cohesiveness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing capability and widespread usage of large language models (LLMs) highlight the desirability of automatic detection of LLM-generated text. Zero-shot detectors, due to their training-free nature, have received considerable attention and notable success. In this paper, we identify a new feature, token cohesiveness, that is useful for zero-shot detection, and we demonstrate that LLM-generated text tends to exhibit higher token cohesiveness than human-written text. Based on this observation, we devise TOCSIN, a generic dual-channel detection paradigm that uses token cohesiveness as a plug-and-play module to improve existing zero-shot detectors. To calculate token cohesiveness, TOCSIN only requires a few rounds of random token deletion and semantic difference measurement, making it particularly suitable for a practical black-box setting where the source model used for generation is not accessible. Extensive experiments with four state-of-the-art base detectors on various datasets, source models, and evaluation settings demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach.

      <description>arXiv:2409.16934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the presence of OCR-sensitive neurons within the Transformer architecture and their influence on named entity recognition (NER) performance on historical documents. By analysing neuron activation patterns in response to clean and noisy text inputs, we identify and then neutralise OCR-sensitive neurons to improve model performance. Based on two open access large language models (Llama2 and Mistral), experiments demonstrate the existence of OCR-sensitive regions and show improvements in NER performance on historical newspapers and classical commentaries, highlighting the potential of targeted neuron modulation to improve models' performance on noisy text.</description>

      <title>Weighted Cross-entropy for Low-Resource Languages in Multilingual Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of integrating low-resource languages into multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. We introduce a novel application of weighted cross-entropy, typically used for unbalanced datasets, to facilitate the integration of low-resource languages into pre-trained multilingual ASR models within the context of continual multilingual learning. We fine-tune the Whisper multilingual ASR model on five high-resource languages and one low-resource language, employing language-weighted dynamic cross-entropy and data augmentation. The results show a remarkable 6.69% word error rate (WER) reduction for the low-resource language compared to the fine-tuned model without applying our approach, and a 48.86% WER reduction compared to the original Whisper model. In addition, our approach yields an average WER reduction of 3.29% across the six languages, showing no degradation for the high-resource languages.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Self-Supervised Learning Strategies for Dynamic On-Device LLM Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized how we interact with technology, but their personalization to individual user preferences remains a significant challenge, particularly in on-device applications. Traditional methods often depend heavily on labeled datasets and can be resource-intensive. To address these issues, we present Adaptive Self-Supervised Learning Strategies (ASLS), which utilizes self-supervised learning techniques to personalize LLMs dynamically. The framework comprises a user profiling layer for collecting interaction data and a neural adaptation layer for real-time model fine-tuning. This innovative approach enables continuous learning from user feedback, allowing the model to generate responses that align closely with user-specific contexts. The adaptive mechanisms of ASLS minimize computational demands and enhance personalization efficiency. Experimental results across various user scenarios illustrate the superior performance of ASLS in boosting user engagement and satisfaction, highlighting its potential to redefine LLMs as highly responsive and context-aware systems on-device.</description>

      <title>LLM-CARD: Towards a Description and Landscape of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field, a vast variety of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to emerge for diverse NLP tasks. As an increasing number of papers are presented, researchers and developers face the challenge of information overload. Thus, it is particularly important to develop a system that can automatically extract and organise key information about LLMs from academic papers (\textbf{LLM model card}). This work is to develop such a pioneer system by using Named Entity Recognition (\textbf{NER}) and Relation Extraction (\textbf{RE}) methods that automatically extract key information about large language models from the papers, helping researchers to efficiently access information about LLMs. These features include model \textit{licence}, model \textit{name}, and model \textit{application}. With these features, we can form a model card for each paper. \textbf{Data-contribution} wise, 106 academic papers were processed by defining three dictionaries - LLMs name, licence, and application. 11,051 sentences were extracted through dictionary lookup, and the dataset was constructed through manual review of the final selection of 129 sentences that have a link between the name and the licence, and 106 sentences that have a link between the model name and the application.</description>

      <title>How to Connect Speech Foundation Models and Large Language Models? What Matters and What Does Not</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable performance achieved by Large Language Models (LLM) has driven research efforts to leverage them for a wide range of tasks and input modalities. In speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, the emerging solution consists of projecting the output of the encoder of a Speech Foundational Model (SFM) into the LLM embedding space through an adapter module. However, no work has yet investigated how much the downstream-task performance depends on each component (SFM, adapter, LLM) nor whether the best design of the adapter depends on the chosen SFM and LLM. To fill this gap, we evaluate the combination of 5 adapter modules, 2 LLMs (Mistral and Llama), and 2 SFMs (Whisper and SeamlessM4T) on two widespread S2T tasks, namely Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Translation. Our results demonstrate that the SFM plays a pivotal role in downstream performance, while the adapter choice has moderate impact and depends on the SFM and LLM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting and answering ambiguous questions has been a challenging task in open-domain question answering. Ambiguous questions have different answers depending on their interpretation and can take diverse forms. Temporally ambiguous questions are one of the most common types of such questions. In this paper, we introduce TEMPAMBIQA, a manually annotated temporally ambiguous QA dataset consisting of 8,162 open-domain questions derived from existing datasets. Our annotations focus on capturing temporal ambiguity to study the task of detecting temporally ambiguous questions. We propose a novel approach by using diverse search strategies based on disambiguated versions of the questions. We also introduce and test non-search, competitive baselines for detecting temporal ambiguity using zero-shot and few-shot approaches.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Post-Hoc Attributions in Long Document Comprehension via Coarse Grained Answer Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately attributing answer text to its source document is crucial for developing a reliable question-answering system. However, attribution for long documents remains largely unexplored. Post-hoc attribution systems are designed to map answer text back to the source document, yet the granularity of this mapping has not been addressed. Furthermore, a critical question arises: What precisely should be attributed, with an emphasis on identifying the information units within an answer that necessitate grounding? In this paper, we propose and investigate a novel approach to the factual decomposition of generated answers for attribution, employing template-based in-context learning. To accomplish this, we utilize the question and integrate negative sampling during few-shot in-context learning for decomposition. This approach enhances the semantic understanding of both abstractive and extractive answers. We examine the impact of answer decomposition by providing a thorough examination of various attribution approaches, ranging from retrieval-based techniques to LLM-based attributors.</description>

      <title>Programming Every Example: Lifting Pre-training Data Quality like Experts at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model pre-training has traditionally relied on human experts to craft heuristics for improving the corpora quality, resulting in numerous rules developed to date. However, these rules lack the flexibility to address the unique characteristics of individual example effectively. Meanwhile, applying tailored rules to every example is impractical for human experts. In this paper, we demonstrate that even small language models, with as few as 0.3B parameters, can exhibit substantial data refining capabilities comparable to those of human experts. We introduce Programming Every Example (ProX), a novel framework that treats data refinement as a programming task, enabling models to refine corpora by generating and executing fine-grained operations, such as string normalization, for each individual example at scale. Experimental results show that models pre-trained on ProX-curated data outperform either original data or data filtered by other selection methods by more than 2% across various downstream benchmarks. Its effectiveness spans various model sizes and pre-training corpora, including C4, RedPajama-V2, and FineWeb. Furthermore, ProX exhibits significant potential in domain-specific continual pre-training: without domain specific design, models trained on OpenWebMath refined by ProX outperform human-crafted rule-based methods, improving average accuracy by 7.6% over Mistral-7B, with 14.6% for Llama-2-7B and 20.3% for CodeLlama-7B, all within 10B tokens to be comparable to models like Llemma-7B trained on 200B tokens. Further analysis highlights that ProX significantly saves training FLOPs, offering a promising path for efficient LLM pre-training.We are open-sourcing ProX with &gt;100B corpus, models, and sharing all training and implementation details for reproducible research and future innovation.

      <title>Assessing the Level of Toxicity Against Distinct Groups in Bangla Social Media Comments: A Comprehensive Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms have a vital role in the modern world, serving as conduits for communication, the exchange of ideas, and the establishment of networks. However, the misuse of these platforms through toxic comments, which can range from offensive remarks to hate speech, is a concerning issue. This study focuses on identifying toxic comments in the Bengali language targeting three specific groups: transgender people, indigenous people, and migrant people, from multiple social media sources. The study delves into the intricate process of identifying and categorizing toxic language while considering the varying degrees of toxicity: high, medium, and low. The methodology involves creating a dataset, manual annotation, and employing pre-trained transformer models like Bangla-BERT, bangla-bert-base, distil-BERT, and Bert-base-multilingual-cased for classification. Diverse assessment metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score are employed to evaluate the model's effectiveness. The experimental findings reveal that Bangla-BERT surpasses alternative models, achieving an F1-score of 0.8903. This research exposes the complexity of toxicity in Bangla social media dialogues, revealing its differing impacts on diverse demographic groups.</description>

      <title>FineZip : Pushing the Limits of Large Language Models for Practical Lossless Text Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the language modeling objective has been shown to be deeply connected with compression, it is surprising that modern LLMs are not employed in practical text compression systems. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of neural network and transformer-based compression techniques to answer this question. We compare traditional text compression systems with neural network and LLM-based text compression methods. Although LLM-based systems significantly outperform conventional compression methods, they are highly impractical. Specifically, LLMZip, a recent text compression system using Llama3-8B requires 9.5 days to compress just 10 MB of text, although with huge improvements in compression ratios. To overcome this, we present FineZip - a novel LLM-based text compression system that combines ideas of online memorization and dynamic context to reduce the compression time immensely. FineZip can compress the above corpus in approximately 4 hours compared to 9.5 days, a 54 times improvement over LLMZip and comparable performance. FineZip outperforms traditional algorithmic compression methods with a large margin, improving compression ratios by approximately 50\%. With this work, we take the first step towards making lossless text compression with LLMs a reality. While FineZip presents a significant step in that direction, LLMs are still not a viable solution for large-scale text compression. We hope our work paves the way for future research and innovation to solve this problem.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Word Discovery: Boundary Detection with Clustering vs. Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We look at the long-standing problem of segmenting unlabeled speech into word-like segments and clustering these into a lexicon. Several previous methods use a scoring model coupled with dynamic programming to find an optimal segmentation. Here we propose a much simpler strategy: we predict word boundaries using the dissimilarity between adjacent self-supervised features, then we cluster the predicted segments to construct a lexicon. For a fair comparison, we update the older ES-KMeans dynamic programming method with better features and boundary constraints. On the five-language ZeroSpeech benchmarks, our simple approach gives similar state-of-the-art results compared to the new ES-KMeans+ method, while being almost five times faster.</description>

      <title>Efficient Training of Self-Supervised Speech Foundation Models on a Compute Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their impressive success, training foundation models remains computationally costly. This paper investigates how to efficiently train speech foundation models with self-supervised learning (SSL) under a limited compute budget. We examine critical factors in SSL that impact the budget, including model architecture, model size, and data size. Our goal is to make analytical steps toward understanding the training dynamics of speech foundation models. We benchmark SSL objectives in an entirely comparable setting and find that other factors contribute more significantly to the success of SSL. Our results show that slimmer model architectures outperform common small architectures under the same compute and parameter budget. We demonstrate that the size of the pre-training data remains crucial, even with data augmentation during SSL training, as performance suffers when iterating over limited data. Finally, we identify a trade-off between model size and data size, highlighting an optimal model size for a given compute budget.</description>

      <title>How Redundant Is the Transformer Stack in Speech Representation Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised speech representation models, particularly those leveraging transformer architectures, have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks such as speech recognition, speaker identification, and emotion detection. Recent studies on transformer models revealed a high redundancy between layers and the potential for significant pruning, which we will investigate here for transformer-based speech representation models. We perform a detailed analysis of layer similarity in speech representation models using three similarity metrics: cosine similarity, centered kernel alignment, and mutual nearest-neighbor alignment. Our findings reveal a block-like structure of high similarity, suggesting two main processing steps and significant redundancy of layers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of pruning transformer-based speech representation models without the need for post-training, achieving up to 40% reduction in transformer layers while maintaining over 95% of the model's predictive capacity. Furthermore, we employ a knowledge distillation method to substitute the entire transformer stack with mimicking layers, reducing the network size 95-98% and the inference time by up to 94%. This substantial decrease in computational load occurs without considerable performance loss, suggesting that the transformer stack is almost completely redundant for downstream applications of speech representation models.</description>

      <title>A Literature Review of Keyword Spotting Technologies for Urdu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This literature review surveys the advancements of keyword spotting (KWS) technologies, specifically focusing on Urdu, Pakistan's low-resource language (LRL), which has complex phonetics. Despite the global strides in speech technology, Urdu presents unique challenges requiring more tailored solutions. The review traces the evolution from foundational Gaussian Mixture Models to sophisticated neural architectures like deep neural networks and transformers, highlighting significant milestones such as integrating multi-task learning and self-supervised approaches that leverage unlabeled data. It examines emerging technologies' role in enhancing KWS systems' performance within multilingual and resource-constrained settings, emphasizing the need for innovations that cater to languages like Urdu. Thus, this review underscores the need for context-specific research addressing the inherent complexities of Urdu and similar URLs and the means of regions communicating through such languages for a more inclusive approach to speech technology.</description>

      <title>Towards Within-Class Variation in Alzheimer's Disease Detection from Spontaneous Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection has emerged as a promising research area that employs machine learning classification models to distinguish between individuals with AD and those without. Unlike conventional classification tasks, we identify within-class variation as a critical challenge in AD detection: individuals with AD exhibit a spectrum of cognitive impairments. Given that many AD detection tasks lack fine-grained labels, simplistic binary classification may overlook two crucial aspects: within-class differences and instance-level imbalance. The former compels the model to map AD samples with varying degrees of impairment to a single diagnostic label, disregarding certain changes in cognitive function. While the latter biases the model towards overrepresented severity levels. This work presents early efforts to address these challenges. We propose two novel methods: Soft Target Distillation (SoTD) and Instance-level Re-balancing (InRe), targeting two problems respectively. Experiments on the ADReSS and ADReSSo datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve detection accuracy. Further analysis reveals that SoTD effectively harnesses the strengths of multiple component models, while InRe substantially alleviates model over-fitting. These findings provide insights for developing more robust and reliable AD detection models.</description>

      <title>Quality Matters: Evaluating Synthetic Data for Tool-Using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) for external tool usage is a rapidly expanding field, with recent research focusing on generating synthetic data to address the shortage of available data. However, the absence of systematic data quality checks poses complications for properly training and testing models. To that end, we propose two approaches for assessing the reliability of data for training LLMs to use external tools. The first approach uses intuitive, human-defined correctness criteria. The second approach uses a model-driven assessment with in-context evaluation. We conduct a thorough evaluation of data quality on two popular benchmarks, followed by an extrinsic evaluation that showcases the impact of data quality on model performance. Our results demonstrate that models trained on high-quality data outperform those trained on unvalidated data, even when trained with a smaller quantity of data. These findings empirically support the significance of assessing and ensuring the reliability of training data for tool-using LLMs.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Acoustic Features for Robust ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems must be robust to the myriad types of noises present in real-world environments including environmental noise, room impulse response, special effects as well as attacks by malicious actors (adversarial attacks). Recent works seek to improve accuracy and robustness by developing novel Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and curating diverse training datasets for them, while using relatively simple acoustic features. While this approach improves robustness to the types of noise present in the training data, it confers limited robustness against unseen noises and negligible robustness to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we revisit the approach of earlier works that developed acoustic features inspired by biological auditory perception that could be used to perform accurate and robust ASR. In contrast, Specifically, we evaluate the ASR accuracy and robustness of several biologically inspired acoustic features. In addition to several features from prior works, such as gammatone filterbank features (GammSpec), we also propose two new acoustic features called frequency masked spectrogram (FreqMask) and difference of gammatones spectrogram (DoGSpec) to simulate the neuro-psychological phenomena of frequency masking and lateral suppression. Experiments on diverse models and datasets show that (1) DoGSpec achieves significantly better robustness than the highly popular log mel spectrogram (LogMelSpec) with minimal accuracy degradation, and (2) GammSpec achieves better accuracy and robustness to non-adversarial noises from the Speech Robust Bench benchmark, but it is outperformed by DoGSpec against adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>A Unified Hallucination Mitigation Framework for Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hallucination is a common problem for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with long generations which is difficult to eradicate. The generation with hallucinations is partially inconsistent with the image content. To mitigate hallucination, current studies either focus on the process of model inference or the results of model generation, but the solutions they design sometimes do not deal appropriately with various types of queries and the hallucinations of the generations about these queries. To accurately deal with various hallucinations, we present a unified framework, Dentist, for hallucination mitigation. The core step is to first classify the queries, then perform different processes of hallucination mitigation based on the classification result, just like a dentist first observes the teeth and then makes a plan. In a simple deployment, Dentist can classify queries as perception or reasoning and easily mitigate potential hallucinations in answers which has been demonstrated in our experiments. On MMbench, we achieve a 13.44%/10.2%/15.8% improvement in accuracy on Image Quality, a Coarse Perception visual question answering (VQA) task, over the baseline InstructBLIP/LLaVA/VisualGLM.</description>

      <title>Enabling Auditory Large Language Models for Automatic Speech Quality Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech quality assessment typically requires evaluating audio from multiple aspects, such as mean opinion score (MOS) and speaker similarity (SIM) etc., which can be challenging to cover using one small model designed for a single task. In this paper, we propose leveraging recently introduced auditory large language models (LLMs) for automatic speech quality assessment. By employing task-specific prompts, auditory LLMs are finetuned to predict MOS, SIM and A/B testing results, which are commonly used for evaluating text-to-speech systems. Additionally, the finetuned auditory LLM is able to generate natural language descriptions assessing aspects like noisiness, distortion, discontinuity, and overall quality, providing more interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments have been performed on the NISQA, BVCC, SOMOS and VoxSim speech quality datasets, using open-source auditory LLMs such as SALMONN, Qwen-Audio, and Qwen2-Audio. For the natural language descriptions task, a commercial model Google Gemini 1.5 Pro is also evaluated. The results demonstrate that auditory LLMs achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art task-specific small models in predicting MOS and SIM, while also delivering promising results in A/B testing and natural language descriptions. Our data processing scripts and finetuned model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Speech Recognition Rescoring with Large Speech-Text Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have demonstrated the ability to understand human language by leveraging large amount of text data. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are often limited by available transcribed speech data and benefit from a second pass rescoring using LLM. Recently multi-modal large language models, particularly speech and text foundational models have demonstrated strong spoken language understanding. Speech-Text foundational models leverage large amounts of unlabelled and labelled data both in speech and text modalities to model human language. In this work, we propose novel techniques to use multi-modal LLM for ASR rescoring. We also explore discriminative training to further improve the foundational model rescoring performance. We demonstrate cross-modal knowledge transfer in speech-text LLM can benefit rescoring. Our experiments demonstrate up-to 20% relative improvements over Whisper large ASR and up-to 15% relative improvements over text-only LLM.</description>

      <title>Emotional Dimension Control in Language Model-Based Text-to-Speech: Spanning a Broad Spectrum of Human Emotions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current emotional text-to-speech (TTS) systems face challenges in mimicking a broad spectrum of human emotions due to the inherent complexity of emotions and limitations in emotional speech datasets and models. This paper proposes a TTS framework that facilitates control over pleasure, arousal, and dominance, and can synthesize a diversity of emotional styles without requiring any emotional speech data during TTS training. We train an emotional attribute predictor using only categorical labels from speech data, aligning with psychological research and incorporating anchored dimensionality reduction on self-supervised learning (SSL) features. The TTS framework converts text inputs into phonetic tokens via an autoregressive language model and uses pseudo-emotional dimensions to guide the parallel prediction of fine-grained acoustic details. Experiments conducted on the LibriTTS dataset demonstrate that our framework can synthesize speech with enhanced naturalness and a variety of emotional styles by effectively controlling emotional dimensions, even without the inclusion of any emotional speech during TTS training.</description>

      <title>MSI-Agent: Incorporating Multi-Scale Insight into Embodied Agents for Superior Planning and Decision-Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-term memory is significant for agents, in which insights play a crucial role. However, the emergence of irrelevant insight and the lack of general insight can greatly undermine the effectiveness of insight. To solve this problem, in this paper, we introduce Multi-Scale Insight Agent (MSI-Agent), an embodied agent designed to improve LLMs' planning and decision-making ability by summarizing and utilizing insight effectively across different scales. MSI achieves this through the experience selector, insight generator, and insight selector. Leveraging a three-part pipeline, MSI can generate task-specific and high-level insight, store it in a database, and then use relevant insight from it to aid in decision-making. Our experiments show that MSI outperforms another insight strategy when planning by GPT3.5. Moreover, We delve into the strategies for selecting seed experience and insight, aiming to provide LLM with more useful and relevant insight for better decision-making. Our observations also indicate that MSI exhibits better robustness when facing domain-shifting scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in natural language processing, showcasing exceptional performance across various tasks. However, the expensive memory and computational requirements present significant challenges for their practical deployment. Low-bit quantization has emerged as a critical approach to mitigate these challenges by reducing the bit-width of model parameters, activations, and gradients, thus decreasing memory usage and computational demands. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of low-bit quantization methods tailored for LLMs, covering the fundamental principles, system implementations, and algorithmic strategies. An overview of basic concepts and new data formats specific to low-bit LLMs is first introduced, followed by a review of frameworks and systems that facilitate low-bit LLMs across various hardware platforms. Then, we categorize and analyze techniques and toolkits for efficient low-bit training and inference of LLMs. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of future trends and potential advancements of low-bit LLMs. Our systematic overview from basic, system, and algorithm perspectives can offer valuable insights and guidelines for future works to enhance the efficiency and applicability of LLMs through low-bit quantization.</description>

      <title>Beyond Turing Test: Can GPT-4 Sway Experts' Decisions?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the post-Turing era, evaluating large language models (LLMs) involves assessing generated text based on readers' reactions rather than merely its indistinguishability from human-produced content. This paper explores how LLM-generated text impacts readers' decisions, focusing on both amateur and expert audiences. Our findings indicate that GPT-4 can generate persuasive analyses affecting the decisions of both amateurs and professionals. Furthermore, we evaluate the generated text from the aspects of grammar, convincingness, logical coherence, and usefulness. The results highlight a high correlation between real-world evaluation through audience reactions and the current multi-dimensional evaluators commonly used for generative models. Overall, this paper shows the potential and risk of using generated text to sway human decisions and also points out a new direction for evaluating generated text, i.e., leveraging the reactions and decisions of readers. We release our dataset to assist future research.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have witnessed the success of prompt tuning and adapter tuning, while the classic model fine-tuning on inherent parameters seems to be overlooked. It is believed that fine-tuning the parameters of VLMs with few-shot samples corrupts the pre-trained knowledge since fine-tuning the CLIP model even degrades performance. In this paper, we revisit this viewpoint, and propose a new perspective: fine-tuning the specific parameters instead of all will uncover the power of classic model fine-tuning on VLMs. Through our meticulous study, we propose ClipFit, a simple yet effective method to fine-tune CLIP without introducing any overhead of extra parameters. We demonstrate that by only fine-tuning the specific bias terms and normalization layers, ClipFit can improve the performance of zero-shot CLIP by 7.27\% average harmonic mean accuracy. Lastly, to understand how fine-tuning in CLIPFit affects the pre-trained models, we conducted extensive experimental analyses w.r.t. changes in internal parameters and representations. We found that low-level text bias layers and the first layer normalization layer change much more than other layers. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/minglllli/CLIPFit}.</description>

      <title>Exposing Assumptions in AI Benchmarks through Cognitive Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cultural AI benchmarks often rely on implicit assumptions about measured constructs, leading to vague formulations with poor validity and unclear interrelations. We propose exposing these assumptions using explicit cognitive models formulated as Structural Equation Models. Using cross-lingual alignment transfer as an example, we show how this approach can answer key research questions and identify missing datasets. This framework grounds benchmark construction theoretically and guides dataset development to improve construct measurement. By embracing transparency, we move towards more rigorous, cumulative AI evaluation science, challenging researchers to critically examine their assessment foundations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare has gained significant attention due to their ability to process complex medical data and provide insights for clinical decision-making. These models have demonstrated substantial capabilities in understanding and generating natural language, which is crucial for medical documentation, diagnostics, and patient interaction. This review examines the trajectory of language models from their early stages to the current state-of-the-art LLMs, highlighting their strengths in healthcare applications and discussing challenges such as data privacy, bias, and ethical considerations. The potential of LLMs to enhance healthcare delivery is explored, alongside the necessary steps to ensure their ethical and effective integration into medical practice.</description>

      <title>Robotic Backchanneling in Online Conversation Facilitation: A Cross-Generational Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Japan faces many challenges related to its aging society, including increasing rates of cognitive decline in the population and a shortage of caregivers. Efforts have begun to explore solutions using artificial intelligence (AI), especially socially embodied intelligent agents and robots that can communicate with people. Yet, there has been little research on the compatibility of these agents with older adults in various everyday situations. To this end, we conducted a user study to evaluate a robot that functions as a facilitator for a group conversation protocol designed to prevent cognitive decline. We modified the robot to use backchannelling, a natural human way of speaking, to increase receptiveness of the robot and enjoyment of the group conversation experience. We conducted a cross-generational study with young adults and older adults. Qualitative analyses indicated that younger adults perceived the backchannelling version of the robot as kinder, more trustworthy, and more acceptable than the non-backchannelling robot. Finally, we found that the robot's backchannelling elicited nonverbal backchanneling in older participants.</description>

      <title>A Roadmap for Embodied and Social Grounding in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fusion of Large Language Models (LLMs) and robotic systems has led to a transformative paradigm in the robotic field, offering unparalleled capabilities not only in the communication domain but also in skills like multimodal input handling, high-level reasoning, and plan generation. The grounding of LLMs knowledge into the empirical world has been considered a crucial pathway to exploit the efficiency of LLMs in robotics. Nevertheless, connecting LLMs' representations to the external world with multimodal approaches or with robots' bodies is not enough to let them understand the meaning of the language they are manipulating. Taking inspiration from humans, this work draws attention to three necessary elements for an agent to grasp and experience the world. The roadmap for LLMs grounding is envisaged in an active bodily system as the reference point for experiencing the environment, a temporally structured experience for a coherent, self-related interaction with the external world, and social skills to acquire a common-grounded shared experience.</description>

      <title>Cross-lingual Speech Emotion Recognition: Humans vs. Self-Supervised Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has proven effective, yet limited research has explored cross-lingual scenarios. This study presents a comparative analysis between human performance and SSL models, beginning with a layer-wise analysis and an exploration of parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies in monolingual, cross-lingual, and transfer learning contexts. We further compare the SER ability of models and humans at both utterance- and segment-levels. Additionally, we investigate the impact of dialect on cross-lingual SER through human evaluation. Our findings reveal that models, with appropriate knowledge transfer, can adapt to the target language and achieve performance comparable to native speakers. We also demonstrate the significant effect of dialect on SER for individuals without prior linguistic and paralinguistic background. Moreover, both humans and models exhibit distinct behaviors across different emotions. These results offer new insights into the cross-lingual SER capabilities of SSL models, underscoring both their similarities to and differences from human emotion perception.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Cognitive State Classification from Speech with Multi-View Pseudo-Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of labeled data is a common challenge in speech classification tasks, particularly those requiring extensive subjective assessment, such as cognitive state classification. In this work, we propose a Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) framework, introducing a novel multi-view pseudo-labeling method that leverages both acoustic and linguistic characteristics to select the most confident data for training the classification model. Acoustically, unlabeled data are compared to labeled data using the Frechet audio distance, calculated from embeddings generated by multiple audio encoders. Linguistically, large language models are prompted to revise automatic speech recognition transcriptions and predict labels based on our proposed task-specific knowledge. High-confidence data are identified when pseudo-labels from both sources align, while mismatches are treated as low-confidence data. A bimodal classifier is then trained to iteratively label the low-confidence data until a predefined criterion is met. We evaluate our SSL framework on emotion recognition and dementia detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised learning using only 30% of the labeled data and significantly outperforms two selected baselines.</description>

      <title>AXCEL: Automated eXplainable Consistency Evaluation using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in both industry and academia for various tasks, yet evaluating the consistency of generated text responses continues to be a challenge. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BLEU show a weak correlation with human judgment. More sophisticated metrics using Natural Language Inference (NLI) have shown improved correlations but are complex to implement, require domain-specific training due to poor cross-domain generalization, and lack explainability. More recently, prompt-based metrics using LLMs as evaluators have emerged; while they are easier to implement, they still lack explainability and depend on task-specific prompts, which limits their generalizability. This work introduces Automated eXplainable Consistency Evaluation using LLMs (AXCEL), a prompt-based consistency metric which offers explanations for the consistency scores by providing detailed reasoning and pinpointing inconsistent text spans. AXCEL is also a generalizable metric which can be adopted to multiple tasks without changing the prompt. AXCEL outperforms both non-prompt and prompt-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics in detecting inconsistencies across summarization by 8.7%, free text generation by 6.2%, and data-to-text conversion tasks by 29.4%. We also evaluate the influence of underlying LLMs on prompt based metric performance and recalibrate the SOTA prompt-based metrics with the latest LLMs for fair comparison. Further, we show that AXCEL demonstrates strong performance using open source LLMs.</description>

      <title>Models Can and Should Embrace the Communicative Nature of Human-Generated Math</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Math is constructed by people for people: just as natural language corpora reflect not just propositions but the communicative goals of language users, the math data that models are trained on reflects not just idealized mathematical entities but rich communicative intentions. While there are important advantages to treating math in a purely symbolic manner, we here hypothesize that there are benefits to treating math as situated linguistic communication and that language models are well suited for this goal, in ways that are not fully appreciated. We illustrate these points with two case studies. First, we ran an experiment in which we found that language models interpret the equals sign in a humanlike way -- generating systematically different word problems for the same underlying equation arranged in different ways. Second, we found that language models prefer proofs to be ordered in naturalistic ways, even though other orders would be logically equivalent. We advocate for AI systems that learn from and represent the communicative intentions latent in human-generated math.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Token Generation in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: "Sure, I am happy to generate a story for you: Captain Lyra stood at the helm of her trusty ship, the Maelstrom's Fury, gazing out at the endless sea. [...] Lyra's eyes welled up with tears as she realized the bitter truth - she had sacrificed everything for fleeting riches, and lost the love of her crew, her family, and herself." Although this story, generated by a large language model, is captivating, one may wonder -- how would the story have unfolded if the model had chosen "Captain Maeve" as the protagonist instead? We cannot know. State-of-the-art large language models are stateless -- they maintain no internal memory or state. Given a prompt, they generate a sequence of tokens as an output using an autoregressive process. As a consequence, they cannot reason about counterfactual alternatives to tokens they have generated in the past. In this work, our goal is to enhance them with this functionality. To this end, we develop a causal model of token generation that builds upon the Gumbel-Max structural causal model. Our model allows any large language model to perform counterfactual token generation at almost no cost in comparison with vanilla token generation, it is embarrassingly simple to implement, and it does not require any fine-tuning nor prompt engineering. We implement our model on Llama 3 8B-instruct and conduct both qualitative and quantitative analyses of counterfactually generated text. We conclude with a demonstrative application of counterfactual token generation for bias detection, unveiling interesting insights about the model of the world constructed by large language models.</description>

      <title>Using LLM for Real-Time Transcription and Summarization of Doctor-Patient Interactions into ePuskesmas in Indonesia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the key issues contributing to inefficiency in Puskesmas is the time-consuming nature of doctor-patient interactions. Doctors need to conduct thorough consultations, which include diagnosing the patient's condition, providing treatment advice, and transcribing detailed notes into medical records. In regions with diverse linguistic backgrounds, doctors often have to ask clarifying questions, further prolonging the process. While diagnosing is essential, transcription and summarization can often be automated using AI to improve time efficiency and help doctors enhance care quality and enable early diagnosis and intervention. This paper proposes a solution using a localized large language model (LLM) to transcribe, translate, and summarize doctor-patient conversations. We utilize the Whisper model for transcription and GPT-3 to summarize them into the ePuskemas medical records format. This system is implemented as an add-on to an existing web browser extension, allowing doctors to fill out patient forms while talking. By leveraging this solution for real-time transcription, translation, and summarization, doctors can improve the turnaround time for patient care while enhancing the quality of records, which become more detailed and insightful for future visits. This innovation addresses challenges like overcrowded facilities and the administrative burden on healthcare providers in Indonesia. We believe this solution will help doctors save time, provide better care, and produce more accurate medical records, representing a significant step toward modernizing healthcare and ensuring patients receive timely, high-quality care, even in resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>Can Vision Language Models Learn from Visual Demonstrations of Ambiguous Spatial Reasoning?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have become state-of-the-art for many computer vision tasks, with in-context learning (ICL) as a popular adaptation strategy for new ones. But can VLMs learn novel concepts purely from visual demonstrations, or are they limited to adapting to the output format of ICL examples? We propose a new benchmark we call Spatial Visual Ambiguity Tasks (SVAT) that challenges state-of-the-art VLMs to learn new visuospatial tasks in-context. We find that VLMs fail to do this zero-shot, and sometimes continue to fail after finetuning. However, adding simpler data to the training by curriculum learning leads to improved ICL performance.</description>

      <title>Molmo and PixMo: Open Weights and Open Data for State-of-the-Art Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today's most advanced multimodal models remain proprietary. The strongest open-weight models rely heavily on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs to achieve good performance, effectively distilling these closed models into open ones. As a result, the community is still missing foundational knowledge about how to build performant VLMs from scratch. We present Molmo, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art in their class of openness. Our key innovation is a novel, highly detailed image caption dataset collected entirely from human annotators using speech-based descriptions. To enable a wide array of user interactions, we also introduce a diverse dataset mixture for fine-tuning that includes in-the-wild Q&amp;A and innovative 2D pointing data. The success of our approach relies on careful choices for the model architecture details, a well-tuned training pipeline, and, most critically, the quality of our newly collected datasets, all of which will be released. The best-in-class 72B model within the Molmo family not only outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models but also compares favorably against proprietary systems like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini 1.5 on both academic benchmarks and human evaluation.
  We will be releasing all of our model weights, captioning and fine-tuning data, and source code in the near future. Select model weights, inference code, and demo are available at https://molmo.allenai.org.</description>

      <title>Keeping Up with the Language Models: Systematic Benchmark Extension for Bias Auditing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bias auditing of language models (LMs) has received considerable attention as LMs are becoming widespread. As such, several benchmarks for bias auditing have been proposed. At the same time, the rapid evolution of LMs can make these benchmarks irrelevant in no time. Bias auditing is further complicated by LM brittleness: when a presumably biased outcome is observed, is it due to model bias or model brittleness? We propose enlisting the models themselves to help construct bias auditing datasets that remain challenging, and introduce bias measures that distinguish between different types of model errors. First, we extend an existing bias benchmark for NLI (BBNLI) using a combination of LM-generated lexical variations, adversarial filtering, and human validation. We demonstrate that the newly created dataset BBNLI-next is more challenging than BBNLI: on average, BBNLI-next reduces the accuracy of state-of-the-art NLI models from 95.3%, as observed by BBNLI, to a strikingly low 57.5%. Second, we employ BBNLI-next to showcase the interplay between robustness and bias: we point out shortcomings in current bias scores and propose bias measures that take into account both bias and model brittleness. Third, despite the fact that BBNLI-next was designed with non-generative models in mind, we show that the new dataset is also able to uncover bias in state-of-the-art open-source generative LMs.
  Note: All datasets included in this work are in English and they address US-centered social biases. In the spirit of efficient NLP research, no model training or fine-tuning was performed to conduct this research.

      <title>Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models are cognitively biased judges. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been shown to be effective as automatic evaluators with simple prompting and in-context learning. In this work, we assemble 15 LLMs of four different size ranges and evaluate their output responses by preference ranking from the other LLMs as evaluators, such as System Star is better than System Square. We then evaluate the quality of ranking outputs introducing the Cognitive Bias Benchmark for LLMs as Evaluators (CoBBLEr), a benchmark to measure six different cognitive biases in LLM evaluation outputs, such as the Egocentric bias where a model prefers to rank its own outputs highly in evaluation. We find that LLMs are biased text quality evaluators, exhibiting strong indications on our bias benchmark (average of 40% of comparisons across all models) within each of their evaluations that question their robustness as evaluators. Furthermore, we examine the correlation between human and machine preferences and calculate the average Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) score to be 49.6%, indicating that machine preferences are misaligned with humans. According to our findings, LLMs may still be unable to be utilized for automatic annotation aligned with human preferences.

      <title>Conversational Health Agents: A Personalized LLM-Powered Agent Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02374v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) are interactive systems that provide healthcare services, such as assistance and diagnosis. Current CHAs, especially those utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), primarily focus on conversation aspects. However, they offer limited agent capabilities, specifically lacking multi-step problem-solving, personalized conversations, and multimodal data analysis. Our aim is to overcome these limitations. We propose openCHA, an open-source LLM-powered framework, to empower conversational agents to generate a personalized response for users' healthcare queries. This framework enables developers to integrate external sources including data sources, knowledge bases, and analysis models, into their LLM-based solutions. openCHA includes an orchestrator to plan and execute actions for gathering information from external sources, essential for formulating responses to user inquiries. It facilitates knowledge acquisition, problem-solving capabilities, multilingual and multimodal conversations, and fosters interaction with various AI platforms. We illustrate the framework's proficiency in handling complex healthcare tasks via two demonstrations and four use cases. Moreover, we release openCHA as open source available to the community via GitHub.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Stance Classification on Social Media Using Quantified Moral Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study enhances stance detection on social media by incorporating deeper psychological attributes, specifically individuals' moral foundations. These theoretically-derived dimensions aim to provide a comprehensive profile of an individual's moral concerns which, in recent work, has been linked to behaviour in a range of domains, including society, politics, health, and the environment. In this paper, we investigate how moral foundation dimensions can contribute to predicting an individual's stance on a given target. Specifically we incorporate moral foundation features extracted from text, along with message semantic features, to classify stances at both message- and user-levels using both traditional machine learning models and large language models. Our preliminary results suggest that encoding moral foundations can enhance the performance of stance detection tasks and help illuminate the associations between specific moral foundations and online stances on target topics. The results highlight the importance of considering deeper psychological attributes in stance analysis and underscores the role of moral foundations in guiding online social behavior.</description>

      <title>Integrating curation into scientific publishing to train AI models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High throughput extraction and structured labeling of data from academic articles is critical to enable downstream machine learning applications and secondary analyses. We have embedded multimodal data curation into the academic publishing process to annotate segmented figure panels and captions. Natural language processing (NLP) was combined with human-in-the-loop feedback from the original authors to increase annotation accuracy. Annotation included eight classes of bioentities (small molecules, gene products, subcellular components, cell lines, cell types, tissues, organisms, and diseases) plus additional classes delineating the entities' roles in experiment designs and methodologies. The resultant dataset, SourceData-NLP, contains more than 620,000 annotated biomedical entities, curated from 18,689 figures in 3,223 articles in molecular and cell biology. We evaluate the utility of the dataset to train AI models using named-entity recognition, segmentation of figure captions into their constituent panels, and a novel context-dependent semantic task assessing whether an entity is a controlled intervention target or a measurement object. We also illustrate the use of our dataset in performing a multi-modal task for segmenting figures into panel images and their corresponding captions.</description>

      <title>Neuron-Level Knowledge Attribution in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12141v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying important neurons for final predictions is essential for understanding the mechanisms of large language models. Due to computational constraints, current attribution techniques struggle to operate at neuron level. In this paper, we propose a static method for pinpointing significant neurons. Compared to seven other methods, our approach demonstrates superior performance across three metrics. Additionally, since most static methods typically only identify "value neurons" directly contributing to the final prediction, we propose a method for identifying "query neurons" which activate these "value neurons". Finally, we apply our methods to analyze six types of knowledge across both attention and feed-forward network (FFN) layers. Our method and analysis are helpful for understanding the mechanisms of knowledge storage and set the stage for future research in knowledge editing. The code is available on https://github.com/zepingyu0512/neuron-attribution.</description>

      <title>How do Large Language Models Learn In-Context? Query and Key Matrices of In-Context Heads are Two Towers for Metric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanism of in-context learning (ICL) on sentence classification tasks with semantically-unrelated labels ("foo"/"bar"). We find intervening in only 1\% heads (named "in-context heads") significantly affects ICL accuracy from 87.6\% to 24.4\%. To understand this phenomenon, we analyze the value-output vectors in these heads and discover that the vectors at each label position contain substantial information about the corresponding labels. Furthermore, we observe that the prediction shift from "foo" to "bar" is due to the respective reduction and increase in these heads' attention scores at "foo" and "bar" positions. Therefore, we propose a hypothesis for ICL: in in-context heads, the value-output matrices extract label features, while the query-key matrices compute the similarity between the features at the last position and those at each label position. The query and key matrices can be considered as two towers that learn the similarity metric between the last position's features and each demonstration at label positions. Using this hypothesis, we explain the majority label bias and recency bias in ICL and propose two methods to reduce these biases by 22\% and 17\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>The Fine Line: Navigating Large Language Model Pretraining with Down-streaming Capability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncovering early-stage metrics that reflect final model performance is one core principle for large-scale pretraining. The existing scaling law demonstrates the power-law correlation between pretraining loss and training flops, which serves as an important indicator of the current training state for large language models. However, this principle only focuses on the model's compression properties on the training data, resulting in an inconsistency with the ability improvements on the downstream tasks. Some follow-up works attempted to extend the scaling-law to more complex metrics (such as hyperparameters), but still lacked a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic differences among various capabilities during pretraining. To address the aforementioned limitations, this paper undertakes a comprehensive comparison of model capabilities at various pretraining intermediate checkpoints. Through this analysis, we confirm that specific downstream metrics exhibit similar training dynamics across models of different sizes, up to 67 billion parameters. In addition to our core findings, we've reproduced Amber and OpenLLaMA, releasing their intermediate checkpoints. This initiative offers valuable resources to the research community and facilitates the verification and exploration of LLM pretraining by open-source researchers. Besides, we provide empirical summaries, including performance comparisons of different models and capabilities, and tuition of key metrics for different training phases. Based on these findings, we provide a more user-friendly strategy for evaluating the optimization state, offering guidance for establishing a stable pretraining process.</description>

Abstract: We present Eagle (RWKV-5) and Finch (RWKV-6), sequence models improving upon the RWKV (RWKV-4) architecture. Our architectural design advancements include multi-headed matrix-valued states and a dynamic recurrence mechanism that improve expressivity while maintaining the inference efficiency characteristics of RNNs. We introduce a new multilingual corpus with 1.12 trillion tokens and a fast tokenizer based on greedy matching for enhanced multilinguality. We trained four Eagle models, ranging from 0.46 to 7.5 billion parameters, and two Finch models with 1.6 and 3.1 billion parameters and find that they achieve competitive performance across a wide variety of benchmarks. We release all our models on HuggingFace under the Apache 2.0 license.

      <title>Translation of Multifaceted Data without Re-Training of Machine Translation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Translating major language resources to build minor language resources becomes a widely-used approach. Particularly in translating complex data points composed of multiple components, it is common to translate each component separately. However, we argue that this practice often overlooks the interrelation between components within the same data point. To address this limitation, we propose a novel MT pipeline that considers the intra-data relation in implementing MT for training data. In our MT pipeline, all the components in a data point are concatenated to form a single translation sequence and subsequently reconstructed to the data components after translation. We introduce a Catalyst Statement (CS) to enhance the intra-data relation, and Indicator Token (IT) to assist the decomposition of a translated sequence into its respective data components. Through our approach, we have achieved a considerable improvement in translation quality itself, along with its effectiveness as training data. Compared with the conventional approach that translates each data component separately, our method yields better training data that enhances the performance of the trained model by 2.690 points for the web page ranking (WPR) task, and 0.845 for the question generation (QG) task in the XGLUE benchmark.</description>

      <title>Ranking Manipulation for Conversational Search Engines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Major search engine providers are rapidly incorporating Large Language Model (LLM)-generated content in response to user queries. These conversational search engines operate by loading retrieved website text into the LLM context for summarization and interpretation. Recent research demonstrates that LLMs are highly vulnerable to jailbreaking and prompt injection attacks, which disrupt the safety and quality goals of LLMs using adversarial strings. This work investigates the impact of prompt injections on the ranking order of sources referenced by conversational search engines. To this end, we introduce a focused dataset of real-world consumer product websites and formalize conversational search ranking as an adversarial problem. Experimentally, we analyze conversational search rankings in the absence of adversarial injections and show that different LLMs vary significantly in prioritizing product name, document content, and context position. We then present a tree-of-attacks-based jailbreaking technique which reliably promotes low-ranked products. Importantly, these attacks transfer effectively to state-of-the-art conversational search engines such as perplexity$.$ai. Given the strong financial incentive for website owners to boost their search ranking, we argue that our problem formulation is of critical importance for future robustness work.</description>

      <title>Boosting Scientific Concepts Understanding: Can Analogy from Teacher Models Empower Student Models?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analogical reasoning plays a critical role in human cognition, enabling us to understand new concepts by associating them with familiar ones. Previous research in the AI community has mainly focused on identifying and generating analogies and then examining their quality under human evaluation, which overlooks the practical application of these analogies in real-world settings. Inspired by the human education process, in this paper, we propose to investigate how analogies created by teacher language models (LMs) can assist student LMs in understanding scientific concepts, thereby aligning more closely with practical scenarios. Our results suggest that free-form analogies can indeed aid LMs in understanding concepts. Additionally, analogies generated by student LMs can improve their own performance on scientific question answering, demonstrating their capability to use analogies for self-learning new knowledge.

      <title>Is This a Bad Table? A Closer Look at the Evaluation of Table Generation from Text</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding whether a generated table is of good quality is important to be able to use it in creating or editing documents using automatic methods. In this work, we underline that existing measures for table quality evaluation fail to capture the overall semantics of the tables, and sometimes unfairly penalize good tables and reward bad ones. We propose TabEval, a novel table evaluation strategy that captures table semantics by first breaking down a table into a list of natural language atomic statements and then compares them with ground truth statements using entailment-based measures. To validate our approach, we curate a dataset comprising of text descriptions for 1,250 diverse Wikipedia tables, covering a range of topics and structures, in contrast to the limited scope of existing datasets. We compare TabEval with existing metrics using unsupervised and supervised text-to-table generation methods, demonstrating its stronger correlation with human judgments of table quality across four datasets.</description>

      <title>Can we teach language models to gloss endangered languages?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interlinear glossed text (IGT) is a popular format in language documentation projects, where each morpheme is labeled with a descriptive annotation. Automating the creation of interlinear glossed text can be desirable to reduce annotator effort and maintain consistency across annotated corpora. Prior research has explored a number of statistical and neural methods for automatically producing IGT.
  As large language models (LLMs) have showed promising results across multilingual tasks, even for rare, endangered languages, it is natural to wonder whether they can be utilized for the task of generating IGT. We explore whether LLMs can be effective at the task of interlinear glossing with in-context learning, without any traditional training. We propose new approaches for selecting examples to provide in-context, observing that targeted selection can significantly improve performance. We find that LLM-based methods beat standard transformer baselines, despite requiring no training at all. These approaches still underperform state-of-the-art supervised systems for the task, but are highly practical for researchers outside of the NLP community, requiring minimal effort to use.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) has put forward the study of biases as a crucial field. It is important to assess the influence of different types of biases embedded in LLMs to ensure fair use in sensitive fields. Although there have been extensive works on bias assessment in English, such efforts are rare and scarce for a major language like Bangla. In this work, we examine two types of social biases in LLM generated outputs for Bangla language. Our main contributions in this work are: (1) bias studies on two different social biases for Bangla (2) a curated dataset for bias measurement benchmarking (3) testing two different probing techniques for bias detection in the context of Bangla. This is the first work of such kind involving bias assessment of LLMs for Bangla to the best of our knowledge. All our code and resources are publicly available for the progress of bias related research in Bangla NLP.</description>

      <title>SCOI: Syntax-augmented Coverage-based In-context Example Selection for Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) greatly improves the performance of large language models (LLMs) on various down-stream tasks, where the improvement highly depends on the quality of demonstrations. In this work, we introduce syntactic knowledge to select better in-context examples for machine translation (MT). We propose a new strategy, namely Syntax-augmented COverage-based In-context example selection (SCOI), leveraging the deep syntactic structure beyond conventional word matching. Specifically, we measure the set-level syntactic coverage by computing the coverage of polynomial terms with the help of a simplified tree-to-polynomial algorithm, and lexical coverage using word overlap. Furthermore, we devise an alternate selection approach to combine both coverage measures, taking advantage of syntactic and lexical information. We conduct experiments with two multi-lingual LLMs on six translation directions. Empirical results show that our proposed SCOI obtains the highest average COMET score among all learning-free methods, indicating that combining syntactic and lexical coverage successfully helps to select better in-context examples for MT.

      <title>Math-PUMA: Progressive Upward Multimodal Alignment to Enhance Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in solving text-based mathematical problems, but they struggle with mathematical diagrams since they are primarily trained on natural scene images. For humans, visual aids generally enhance problem-solving, but MLLMs perform worse as information shifts from textual to visual modality. This decline is mainly due to their shortcomings in aligning images and text. To tackle aforementioned challenges, we propose Math-PUMA, a methodology focused on Progressive Upward Multimodal Alignment. This approach is designed to improve the mathematical reasoning skills of MLLMs through a three-stage training process, with the second stage being the critical alignment stage. We first enhance the language model's mathematical reasoning capabilities with extensive set of textual mathematical problems. We then construct a multimodal dataset with varying degrees of textual and visual information, creating data pairs by presenting each problem in at least two forms. By leveraging the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of next-token prediction distributions to align visual and textual modalities, consistent problem-solving abilities are ensured. Finally, we utilize multimodal instruction tuning for MLLMs with high-quality multimodal data. Experimental results on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that the MLLMs trained with Math-PUMA surpass most open-source MLLMs. Our approach effectively narrows the performance gap for problems presented in different modalities.

      <title>WeQA: A Benchmark for Retrieval Augmented Generation in Wind Energy Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text generation, the emergence of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) presents a promising avenue for improving the quality and reliability of generated text by leveraging information retrieved from user specified database. Benchmarking is essential to evaluate and compare the performance of the different RAG configurations in terms of retriever and generator, providing insights into their effectiveness, scalability, and suitability for the specific domain and applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework to generate a domain relevant RAG benchmark. Our framework is based on automatic question-answer generation with Human (domain experts)-AI Large Language Model (LLM) teaming. As a case study, we demonstrate the framework by introducing WeQA, a first-of-its-kind benchmark on the wind energy domain which comprises of multiple scientific documents/reports related to environmental impact of wind energy projects. Our framework systematically evaluates RAG performance using diverse metrics and multiple question types with varying complexity level. We also demonstrate the performance of different models on our benchmark.</description>

      <title>MegaFake: A Theory-Driven Dataset of Fake News Generated by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized online content creation, making it much easier to generate high-quality fake news. This misuse threatens the integrity of our digital environment and ethical standards. Therefore, understanding the motivations and mechanisms behind LLM-generated fake news is crucial. In this study, we analyze the creation of fake news from a social psychology perspective and develop a comprehensive LLM-based theoretical framework, LLM-Fake Theory. We introduce a novel pipeline that automates the generation of fake news using LLMs, thereby eliminating the need for manual annotation. Utilizing this pipeline, we create a theoretically informed Machine-generated Fake news dataset, MegaFake, derived from the GossipCop dataset. We conduct comprehensive analyses to evaluate our MegaFake dataset. We believe that our dataset and insights will provide valuable contributions to future research focused on the detection and governance of fake news in the era of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Cognitive Domains for LLMs: Insights from Taiwanese Hakka Culture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in understanding and processing cultural knowledge, with a specific focus on Hakka culture as a case study. Leveraging Bloom's Taxonomy, the study develops a multi-dimensional framework that systematically assesses LLMs across six cognitive domains: Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, and Creating. This benchmark extends beyond traditional single-dimensional evaluations by providing a deeper analysis of LLMs' abilities to handle culturally specific content, ranging from basic recall of facts to higher-order cognitive tasks such as creative synthesis. Additionally, the study integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to address the challenges of minority cultural knowledge representation in LLMs, demonstrating how RAG enhances the models' performance by dynamically incorporating relevant external information. The results highlight the effectiveness of RAG in improving accuracy across all cognitive domains, particularly in tasks requiring precise retrieval and application of cultural knowledge. However, the findings also reveal the limitations of RAG in creative tasks, underscoring the need for further optimization. This benchmark provides a robust tool for evaluating and comparing LLMs in culturally diverse contexts, offering valuable insights for future research and development in AI-driven cultural knowledge preservation and dissemination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for medical question answering, there is limited work focused on tropical and infectious disease-specific exploration. We build on an opensource tropical and infectious diseases (TRINDs) dataset, expanding it to include demographic and semantic clinical and consumer augmentations yielding 11000+ prompts. We evaluate LLM performance on these, comparing generalist and medical LLMs, as well as LLM outcomes to human experts. We demonstrate through systematic experimentation, the benefit of contextual information such as demographics, location, gender, risk factors for optimal LLM response. Finally we develop a prototype of TRINDs-LM, a research tool that provides a playground to navigate how context impacts LLM outputs for health.</description>

      <title>GEIC: Universal and Multilingual Named Entity Recognition with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have supplanted traditional methods in numerous natural language processing tasks. Nonetheless, in Named Entity Recognition (NER), existing LLM-based methods underperform compared to baselines and require significantly more computational resources, limiting their application. In this paper, we introduce the task of generation-based extraction and in-context classification (GEIC), designed to leverage LLMs' prior knowledge and self-attention mechanisms for NER tasks. We then propose CascadeNER, a universal and multilingual GEIC framework for few-shot and zero-shot NER. CascadeNER employs model cascading to utilize two small-parameter LLMs to extract and classify independently, reducing resource consumption while enhancing accuracy. We also introduce AnythingNER, the first NER dataset specifically designed for LLMs, including 8 languages, 155 entity types and a novel dynamic categorization system. Experiments show that CascadeNER achieves state-of-the-art performance on low-resource and fine-grained scenarios, including CrossNER and FewNERD. Our work is openly accessible.</description>

      <title>Zero-resource Hallucination Detection for Text Generation via Graph-based Contextual Knowledge Triples Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLMs obtain remarkable performance but suffer from hallucinations. Most research on detecting hallucination focuses on the questions with short and concrete correct answers that are easy to check the faithfulness. Hallucination detections for text generation with open-ended answers are more challenging. Some researchers use external knowledge to detect hallucinations in generated texts, but external resources for specific scenarios are hard to access. Recent studies on detecting hallucinations in long text without external resources conduct consistency comparison among multiple sampled outputs. To handle long texts, researchers split long texts into multiple facts and individually compare the consistency of each pairs of facts. However, these methods (1) hardly achieve alignment among multiple facts; (2) overlook dependencies between multiple contextual facts. In this paper, we propose a graph-based context-aware (GCA) hallucination detection for text generations, which aligns knowledge facts and considers the dependencies between contextual knowledge triples in consistency comparison. Particularly, to align multiple facts, we conduct a triple-oriented response segmentation to extract multiple knowledge triples. To model dependencies among contextual knowledge triple (facts), we construct contextual triple into a graph and enhance triples' interactions via message passing and aggregating via RGCN. To avoid the omission of knowledge triples in long text, we conduct a LLM-based reverse verification via reconstructing the knowledge triples. Experiments show that our model enhances hallucination detection and excels all baselines.</description>

      <title>Language Models Learn to Mislead Humans via RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) can produce errors that are hard to detect for humans, especially when the task is complex. RLHF, the most popular post-training method, may exacerbate this problem: to achieve higher rewards, LMs might get better at convincing humans that they are right even when they are wrong. We study this phenomenon under a standard RLHF pipeline, calling it "U-SOPHISTRY" since it is Unintended by model developers. Specifically, we ask time-constrained (e.g., 3-10 minutes) human subjects to evaluate the correctness of model outputs and calculate humans' accuracy against gold labels. On a question-answering task (QuALITY) and programming task (APPS), RLHF makes LMs better at convincing our subjects but not at completing the task correctly. RLHF also makes the model harder to evaluate: our subjects' false positive rate increases by 24.1% on QuALITY and 18.3% on APPS. Finally, we show that probing, a state-of-the-art approach for detecting Intended Sophistry (e.g. backdoored LMs), does not generalize to U-SOPHISTRY. Our results highlight an important failure mode of RLHF and call for more research in assisting humans to align them.</description>

      <title>A is for Absorption: Studying Feature Splitting and Absorption in Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach to decompose the activations of Large Language Models (LLMs) into human-interpretable latents. In this paper, we pose two questions. First, to what extent do SAEs extract monosemantic and interpretable latents? Second, to what extent does varying the sparsity or the size of the SAE affect monosemanticity / interpretability? By investigating these questions in the context of a simple first-letter identification task where we have complete access to ground truth labels for all tokens in the vocabulary, we are able to provide more detail than prior investigations. Critically, we identify a problematic form of feature-splitting we call feature absorption where seemingly monosemantic latents fail to fire in cases where they clearly should. Our investigation suggests that varying SAE size or sparsity is insufficient to solve this issue, and that there are deeper conceptual issues in need of resolution.</description>

      <title>Can AI writing be salvaged? Mitigating Idiosyncrasies and Improving Human-AI Alignment in the Writing Process through Edits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM-based applications are helping people write, and LLM-generated text is making its way into social media, journalism, and our classrooms. However, the differences between LLM-generated and human-written text remain unclear. To explore this, we hired professional writers to edit paragraphs in several creative domains. We first found these writers agree on undesirable idiosyncrasies in LLM-generated text, formalizing it into a seven-category taxonomy (e.g. cliches, unnecessary exposition). Second, we curated the LAMP corpus: 1,057 LLM-generated paragraphs edited by professional writers according to our taxonomy. Analysis of LAMP reveals that none of the LLMs used in our study (GPT4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Llama-3.1-70b) outperform each other in terms of writing quality, revealing common limitations across model families. Third, we explored automatic editing methods to improve LLM-generated text. A large-scale preference annotation confirms that although experts largely prefer text edited by other experts, automatic editing methods show promise in improving alignment between LLM-generated and human-written text.</description>

      <title>Towards a Realistic Long-Term Benchmark for Open-Web Research Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present initial results of a forthcoming benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on white-collar tasks of economic value. We evaluate agents on real-world "messy" open-web research tasks of the type that are routine in finance and consulting. In doing so, we lay the groundwork for an LLM agent evaluation suite where good performance directly corresponds to a large economic and societal impact. We built and tested several agent architectures with o1-preview, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 (405b), and GPT-4o-mini. On average, LLM agents powered by Claude-3.5 Sonnet and o1-preview substantially outperformed agents using GPT-4o, with agents based on Llama 3.1 (405b) and GPT-4o-mini lagging noticeably behind. Across LLMs, a ReAct architecture with the ability to delegate subtasks to subagents performed best. In addition to quantitative evaluations, we qualitatively assessed the performance of the LLM agents by inspecting their traces and reflecting on their observations. Our evaluation represents the first in-depth assessment of agents' abilities to conduct challenging, economically valuable analyst-style research on the real open web.</description>

      <title>Privacy Evaluation Benchmarks for NLP Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By inducing privacy attacks on NLP models, attackers can obtain sensitive information such as training data and model parameters, etc. Although researchers have studied, in-depth, several kinds of attacks in NLP models, they are non-systematic analyses. It lacks a comprehensive understanding of the impact caused by the attacks. For example, we must consider which scenarios can apply to which attacks, what the common factors are that affect the performance of different attacks, the nature of the relationships between different attacks, and the influence of various datasets and models on the effectiveness of the attacks, etc. Therefore, we need a benchmark to holistically assess the privacy risks faced by NLP models. In this paper, we present a privacy attack and defense evaluation benchmark in the field of NLP, which includes the conventional/small models and large language models (LLMs). This benchmark supports a variety of models, datasets, and protocols, along with standardized modules for comprehensive evaluation of attacks and defense strategies. Based on the above framework, we present a study on the association between auxiliary data from different domains and the strength of privacy attacks. And we provide an improved attack method in this scenario with the help of Knowledge Distillation (KD). Furthermore, we propose a chained framework for privacy attacks. Allowing a practitioner to chain multiple attacks to achieve a higher-level attack objective. Based on this, we provide some defense and enhanced attack strategies. The code for reproducing the results can be found at https://github.com/user2311717757/nlp_doctor.</description>

      <title>The FruitShell French synthesis system at the Blizzard 2023 Challenge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00223v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a French text-to-speech synthesis system for the Blizzard Challenge 2023. The challenge consists of two tasks: generating high-quality speech from female speakers and generating speech that closely resembles specific individuals. Regarding the competition data, we conducted a screening process to remove missing or erroneous text data. We organized all symbols except for phonemes and eliminated symbols that had no pronunciation or zero duration. Additionally, we added word boundary and start/end symbols to the text, which we have found to improve speech quality based on our previous experience. For the Spoke task, we performed data augmentation according to the competition rules. We used an open-source G2P model to transcribe the French texts into phonemes. As the G2P model uses the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), we applied the same transcription process to the provided competition data for standardization. However, due to compiler limitations in recognizing special symbols from the IPA chart, we followed the rules to convert all phonemes into the phonetic scheme used in the competition data. Finally, we resampled all competition audio to a uniform sampling rate of 16 kHz. We employed a VITS-based acoustic model with the hifigan vocoder. For the Spoke task, we trained a multi-speaker model and incorporated speaker information into the duration predictor, vocoder, and flow layers of the model. The evaluation results of our system showed a quality MOS score of 3.6 for the Hub task and 3.4 for the Spoke task, placing our system at an average level among all participating teams.</description>

      <title>Pre-trained Language Models Do Not Help Auto-regressive Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in image tokenizers, such as VQ-VAE, have enabled text-to-image generation using auto-regressive methods, similar to language modeling. However, these methods have yet to leverage pre-trained language models, despite their adaptability to various downstream tasks. In this work, we explore this gap by adapting a pre-trained language model for auto-regressive text-to-image generation, and find that pre-trained language models offer limited help. We provide a two-fold explanation by analyzing tokens from each modality. First, we demonstrate that image tokens possess significantly different semantics compared to text tokens, rendering pre-trained language models no more effective in modeling them than randomly initialized ones. Second, the text tokens in the image-text datasets are too simple compared to normal language model pre-training data, which causes the catastrophic degradation of language models' capability.</description>

      <title>Are LLMs Ready for Real-World Materials Discovery?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05200</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) create exciting possibilities for powerful language processing tools to accelerate research in materials science. While LLMs have great potential to accelerate materials understanding and discovery, they currently fall short in being practical materials science tools. In this position paper, we show relevant failure cases of LLMs in materials science that reveal current limitations of LLMs related to comprehending and reasoning over complex, interconnected materials science knowledge. Given those shortcomings, we outline a framework for developing Materials Science LLMs (MatSci-LLMs) that are grounded in materials science knowledge and hypothesis generation followed by hypothesis testing. The path to attaining performant MatSci-LLMs rests in large part on building high-quality, multi-modal datasets sourced from scientific literature where various information extraction challenges persist. As such, we describe key materials science information extraction challenges which need to be overcome in order to build large-scale, multi-modal datasets that capture valuable materials science knowledge. Finally, we outline a roadmap for applying future MatSci-LLMs for real-world materials discovery via: 1. Automated Knowledge Base Generation; 2. Automated In-Silico Material Design; and 3. MatSci-LLM Integrated Self-Driving Materials Laboratories.</description>

      <title>Towards Trustworthy Reranking: A Simple yet Effective Abstention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12997v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Information Retrieval (NIR) has significantly improved upon heuristic-based Information Retrieval (IR) systems. Yet, failures remain frequent, the models used often being unable to retrieve documents relevant to the user's query. We address this challenge by proposing a lightweight abstention mechanism tailored for real-world constraints, with particular emphasis placed on the reranking phase. We introduce a protocol for evaluating abstention strategies in black-box scenarios (typically encountered when relying on API services), demonstrating their efficacy, and propose a simple yet effective data-driven mechanism. We provide open-source code for experiment replication and abstention implementation, fostering wider adoption and application in diverse contexts.</description>

      <title>Speech Robust Bench: A Robustness Benchmark For Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models become ever more pervasive, it is important to ensure that they make reliable predictions under corruptions present in the physical and digital world. We propose Speech Robust Bench (SRB), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the robustness of ASR models to diverse corruptions. SRB is composed of 114 input perturbations which simulate an heterogeneous range of corruptions that ASR models may encounter when deployed in the wild. We use SRB to evaluate the robustness of several state-of-the-art ASR models and observe that model size and certain modeling choices such as the use of discrete representations, or self-training appear to be conducive to robustness. We extend this analysis to measure the robustness of ASR models on data from various demographic subgroups, namely English and Spanish speakers, and males and females. Our results revealed noticeable disparities in the model's robustness across subgroups. We believe that SRB will significantly facilitate future research towards robust ASR models, by making it easier to conduct comprehensive and comparable robustness evaluations.</description>

      <title>Robust Interaction-Based Relevance Modeling for Online e-Commerce Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic relevance calculation is crucial for e-commerce search engines, as it ensures that the items selected closely align with customer intent. Inadequate attention to this aspect can detrimentally affect user experience and engagement. Traditional text-matching techniques are prevalent but often fail to capture the nuances of search intent accurately, so neural networks now have become a preferred solution to processing such complex text matching. Existing methods predominantly employ representation-based architectures, which strike a balance between high traffic capacity and low latency. However, they exhibit significant shortcomings in generalization and robustness when compared to interaction-based architectures. In this work, we introduce a robust interaction-based modeling paradigm to address these shortcomings. It encompasses 1) a dynamic length representation scheme for expedited inference, 2) a professional terms recognition method to identify subjects and core attributes from complex sentence structures, and 3) a contrastive adversarial training protocol to bolster the model's robustness and matching capabilities. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate the superior robustness and effectiveness of our approach, and online A/B testing confirms its ability to improve relevance in the same exposure position, resulting in more clicks and conversions. To the best of our knowledge, this method is the first interaction-based approach for large e-commerce search relevance calculation. Notably, we have deployed it for the entire search traffic on alibaba.com, the largest B2B e-commerce platform in the world.</description>

      <title>TroL: Traversal of Layers for Large Language and Vision Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language and vision models (LLVMs) have been driven by the generalization power of large language models (LLMs) and the advent of visual instruction tuning. Along with scaling them up directly, these models enable LLVMs to showcase powerful vision language (VL) performances by covering diverse tasks via natural language instructions. However, existing open-source LLVMs that perform comparably to closed-source LLVMs such as GPT-4V are often considered too large (e.g., 26B, 34B, and 110B parameters), having a larger number of layers. These large models demand costly, high-end resources for both training and inference. To address this issue, we present a new efficient LLVM family with 1.8B, 3.8B, and 7B LLM model sizes, Traversal of Layers (TroL), which enables the reuse of layers in a token-wise manner. This layer traversing technique simulates the effect of looking back and retracing the answering stream while increasing the number of forward propagation layers without physically adding more layers. We demonstrate that TroL employs a simple layer traversing approach yet efficiently outperforms the open-source LLVMs with larger model sizes and rivals the performances of the closed-source LLVMs with substantial sizes.</description>

      <title>DemoRank: Selecting Effective Demonstrations for Large Language Models in Ranking Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been increasing interest in applying large language models (LLMs) as zero-shot passage rankers. However, few studies have explored how to select appropriate in-context demonstrations for the passage ranking task, which is the focus of this paper. Previous studies mainly use LLM's feedback to train a retriever for demonstration selection. These studies apply the LLM to score each demonstration independently, which ignores the dependencies between demonstrations (especially important in ranking task), leading to inferior performance of top-$k$ retrieved demonstrations. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a demonstration reranker to rerank the retrieved demonstrations so that top-$k$ ranked ones are more suitable for ICL. However, generating training data for such reranker is quite challenging. On the one hand, different from demonstration retriever, the training samples of reranker need to incorporate demonstration dependencies. On the other hand, obtaining the gold ranking from the retrieved demonstrations is an NP-hard problem, which is hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we propose a method to approximate the optimal demonstration list iteratively and utilize LLM to score demonstration lists of varying lengths. By doing so, the search space is greatly reduced and demonstration dependencies are considered. Based on these scored demonstration lists, we further design a list-pairwise training approach which compares a pair of lists that only differ in the last demonstration, to teach the reranker how to select the next demonstration given a previous sequence. In this paper, we propose a demonstration selection framework DemoRank for ranking task and conduct extensive experiments to prove its strong ability.</description>

      <title>HuatuoGPT-Vision, Towards Injecting Medical Visual Knowledge into Multimodal LLMs at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4V, has led to significant advancements. However, these models still face challenges in medical multimodal capabilities due to limitations in the quantity and quality of medical vision-text data, stemming from data privacy concerns and high annotation costs. While pioneering approaches utilize PubMed's large-scale, de-identified medical image-text pairs to address these limitations, they still fall short due to inherent data noise. To tackle this, we refined medical image-text pairs from PubMed and employed MLLMs (GPT-4V) in an 'unblinded' capacity to denoise and reformat the data, resulting in the creation of the PubMedVision dataset with 1.3 million medical VQA samples. Our validation demonstrates that: (1) PubMedVision can significantly enhance the medical multimodal capabilities of current MLLMs, showing significant improvement in benchmarks including the MMMU Health &amp; Medicine track; (2) manual checks by medical experts and empirical results validate the superior data quality of our dataset compared to other data construction methods. Using PubMedVision, we train a 34B medical MLLM HuatuoGPT-Vision, which shows superior performance in medical multimodal scenarios among open-source MLLMs.</description>

      <title>MLLM Is a Strong Reranker: Advancing Multimodal Retrieval-augmented Generation via Knowledge-enhanced Reranking and Noise-injected Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing and generating content across multiple data modalities. However, a significant drawback of MLLMs is their reliance on static training data, leading to outdated information and limited contextual awareness. This static nature hampers their ability to provide accurate and up-to-date responses, particularly in dynamic or rapidly evolving contexts. Though integrating Multimodal Retrieval-augmented Generation (Multimodal RAG) offers a promising solution, the system would inevitably encounter the multi-granularity noisy correspondence (MNC) problem, which hinders accurate retrieval and generation. In this work, we propose RagVL, a novel framework with knowledge-enhanced reranking and noise-injected training, to address these limitations. We instruction-tune the MLLM with a simple yet effective instruction template to induce its ranking ability and serve it as a reranker to precisely filter the top-k retrieved images. For generation, we inject visual noise during training at the data and token levels to enhance the generator's robustness. Extensive experiments on the subsets of two datasets that require retrieving and reasoning over images to answer a given query verify the effectiveness of our method. Code and models are available at https://github.com/IDEA-FinAI/RagVL.</description>

      <title>SurGen: Text-Guided Diffusion Model for Surgical Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation models have made significant strides, producing outputs with improved visual fidelity, temporal coherence, and user control. These advancements hold great promise for improving surgical education by enabling more realistic, diverse, and interactive simulation environments. In this study, we introduce SurGen, a text-guided diffusion model tailored for surgical video synthesis. SurGen produces videos with the highest resolution and longest duration among existing surgical video generation models. We validate the visual and temporal quality of the outputs using standard image and video generation metrics. Additionally, we assess their alignment to the corresponding text prompts through a deep learning classifier trained on surgical data. Our results demonstrate the potential of diffusion models to serve as valuable educational tools for surgical trainees.</description>

      <title>Block-Attention for Efficient RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Block-Attention, an attention mechanism designed to address the increased inference latency and cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. Unlike existing works that encodes the whole context, its main idea lies in dividing the retrieved documents into blocks, where each block calculates key-value (KV) states independently except for the final block. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-Attention enables us to pre-compute the KV states for all passages and cache them in memory, significantly reducing the latency and the computation cost during inference. The implementation involves block segmentation, positional encoding calculation, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-Attention mechanism. Experiments on four RAG benchmarks demonstrate that after block fine-tuning, the Block Attention model can achieve performance comparable to (68.4\% vs 67.9\% on Llama3) or even better (62.8\% vs 59.6\% on Mistral) than self-attention models. Notably, Block-Attention reduces the TTFT (the time to first token) and FLOPs (floating point operations) to a very low level. It only takes 45 ms to output the first token for an input sequence with a total length of 32K. Compared with the self-attention model, the time consumption and corresponding FLOPs are reduced by 98.7\% and 99.8\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>M^2PT: Multimodal Prompt Tuning for Zero-shot Instruction Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across a wide range of domains, with increasing emphasis on enhancing their zero-shot generalization capabilities for unseen tasks across various modalities. Instruction tuning has emerged as an effective strategy for achieving zero-shot generalization by finetuning pretrained models on diverse multimodal tasks. As the scale of MLLMs continues to grow, parameter-efficient finetuning becomes increasingly critical. However, most existing parameter-efficient approaches focus only on single modalities and often overlook the multimodal characteristics during finetuning. In this work, we introduce a novel Multimodal Prompt Tuning (M$^2$PT) approach for efficient instruction tuning of MLLMs. M$^2$PT effectively integrates visual and textual prompts into the vision encoder and language processor respectively during finetuning, facilitating the extraction and alignment of features across modalities. Empirical results on various multimodal evaluation datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to several state-of-the-art baselines. A comprehensive set of ablation studies validates the effectiveness of our prompt design and the efficiency of our approach.</description>
