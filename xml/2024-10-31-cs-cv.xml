      <title>TV-3DG: Mastering Text-to-3D Customized Generation with Visual Prompt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, advancements in generative models have significantly expanded the capabilities of text-to-3D generation. Many approaches rely on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) technology. However, SDS struggles to accommodate multi-condition inputs, such as text and visual prompts, in customized generation tasks. To explore the core reasons, we decompose SDS into a difference term and a classifier-free guidance term. Our analysis identifies the core issue as arising from the difference term and the random noise addition during the optimization process, both contributing to deviations from the target mode during distillation. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm, Classifier Score Matching (CSM), which removes the difference term in SDS and uses a deterministic noise addition process to reduce noise during optimization, effectively overcoming the low-quality limitations of SDS in our customized generation framework. Based on CSM, we integrate visual prompt information with an attention fusion mechanism and sampling guidance techniques, forming the Visual Prompt CSM (VPCSM) algorithm. Furthermore, we introduce a Semantic-Geometry Calibration (SGC) module to enhance quality through improved textual information integration. We present our approach as TV-3DG, with extensive experiments demonstrating its capability to achieve stable, high-quality, customized 3D generation.

      <title>Contrastive Learning with Auxiliary User Detection for Identifying Activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is essential in ubiquitous computing, with far-reaching real-world applications. While recent SOTA HAR research has demonstrated impressive performance, some key aspects remain under-explored. Firstly, HAR can be both highly contextualized and personalized. However, prior work has predominantly focused on being Context-Aware (CA) while largely ignoring the necessity of being User-Aware (UA). We argue that addressing the impact of innate user action-performing differences is equally crucial as considering external contextual environment settings in HAR tasks. Secondly, being user-aware makes the model acknowledge user discrepancies but does not necessarily guarantee mitigation of these discrepancies, i.e., unified predictions under the same activities. There is a need for a methodology that explicitly enforces closer (different user, same activity) representations. To bridge this gap, we introduce CLAUDIA, a novel framework designed to address these issues. Specifically, we expand the contextual scope of the CA-HAR task by integrating User Identification (UI) within the CA-HAR framework, jointly predicting both CA-HAR and UI in a new task called User and Context-Aware HAR (UCA-HAR). This approach enriches personalized and contextual understanding by jointly learning user-invariant and user-specific patterns. Inspired by SOTA designs in the visual domain, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss objective on instance-instance pairs to enhance model efficacy and improve learned feature quality. Evaluation across three real-world CA-HAR datasets reveals substantial performance enhancements, with average improvements ranging from 5.8% to 14.1% in Matthew's Correlation Coefficient and 3.0% to 7.2% in Macro F1 score.</description>

      <title>Domain-Adaptive Pre-training of Self-Supervised Foundation Models for Medical Image Classification in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has transformed gastrointestinal endoscopy (GIE) diagnostics by offering a non-invasive method for capturing detailed images of the gastrointestinal tract, enabling early disease detection. However, its potential is limited by the sheer volume of images generated during the imaging procedure, which can take anywhere from 6-8 hours and often produce up to 1 million images, necessitating automated analysis. Additionally, the variability of these images, combined with the need for expert annotations and the scarcity of large, high-quality labeled datasets, constrains the effectiveness of current medical image analysis models. To address this, we introduce a novel large gastrointestinal endoscopy dataset, called EndoExtend24, created by merging and re-stratifying the train/test splits of ten existing public and private datasets, ensuring no overlap of patient data across splits. EndoExtend24 includes over 226,000 labeled images, as well as dynamic class mappings, which allow unified training across datasets with differing labeling granularity, supporting up to 123 distinct pathological findings. Further, we propose to leverage domain adaptive pre-training of foundation models in computer vision trained with self-supervision on generic image data, to adapt them to the task of GIE medical diagnosis. Specifically, the EVA-02 model, which is based on the vision transformer architecture and was trained on ImageNet-22k with masked image modeling (using EVA-CLIP as a MIM teacher), is pre-trained on the novel EndoExtend24 dataset to achieve domain adaptation, and finally trained on the Capsule Endoscopy 2024 Challenge dataset. Experimental results show promising results on the challenge validation set, with an AUC Macro score of 0.993 and a balanced accuracy of 89.3%.</description>

Abstract: We introduce VEMOCLAP: Video EMOtion Classifier using Pretrained features, the first readily available and open-source web application that analyzes the emotional content of any user-provided video. We improve our previous work, which exploits open-source pretrained models that work on video frames and audio, and then efficiently fuse the resulting pretrained features using multi-head cross-attention. Our approach increases the state-of-the-art classification accuracy on the Ekman-6 video emotion dataset by 4.3% and offers an online application for users to run our model on their own videos or YouTube videos.

      <title>VideoSAM: A Large Vision Foundation Model for High-Speed Video Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-speed video (HSV) segmentation is essential for analyzing dynamic physical processes in scientific and industrial applications, such as boiling heat transfer. Existing models like U-Net struggle with generalization and accurately segmenting complex bubble formations. We present VideoSAM, a specialized adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), fine-tuned on a diverse HSV dataset for phase detection. Through diverse experiments, VideoSAM demonstrates superior performance across four fluid environments -- Water, FC-72, Nitrogen, and Argon -- significantly outperforming U-Net in complex segmentation tasks. In addition to introducing VideoSAM, we contribute an open-source HSV segmentation dataset designed for phase detection, enabling future research in this domain. Our findings underscore VideoSAM's potential to set new standards in robust and accurate HSV segmentation. The code and dataset used in this study are available online at https://github.com/chikap421/videosam .</description>

      <title>A Robust Anchor-based Method for Multi-Camera Pedestrian Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of vision-based pedestrian localization, which estimates a pedestrian's location using images and camera parameters. In practice, however, calibrated camera parameters often deviate from the ground truth, leading to inaccuracies in localization. To address this issue, we propose an anchor-based method that leverages fixed-position anchors to reduce the impact of camera parameter errors. We provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates the robustness of our approach. Experiments conducted on simulated, real-world, and public datasets show that our method significantly improves localization accuracy and remains resilient to noise in camera parameters, compared to methods without anchors.</description>

      <title>ArCSEM: Artistic Colorization of SEM Images via Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEMs) are widely renowned for their ability to analyze the surface structures of microscopic objects, offering the capability to capture highly detailed, yet only grayscale, images. To create more expressive and realistic illustrations, these images are typically manually colorized by an artist with the support of image editing software. This task becomes highly laborious when multiple images of a scanned object require colorization. We propose facilitating this process by using the underlying 3D structure of the microscopic scene to propagate the color information to all the captured images, from as little as one colorized view. We explore several scene representation techniques and achieve high-quality colorized novel view synthesis of a SEM scene. In contrast to prior work, there is no manual intervention or labelling involved in obtaining the 3D representation. This enables an artist to color a single or few views of a sequence and automatically retrieve a fully colored scene or video. Project page: https://ronly2460.github.io/ArCSEM</description>

      <title>MMDocBench: Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models for Fine-Grained Visual Document Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in many vision-language tasks, yet their capabilities in fine-grained visual understanding remain insufficiently evaluated. Existing benchmarks either contain limited fine-grained evaluation samples that are mixed with other data, or are confined to object-level assessments in natural images. To holistically assess LVLMs' fine-grained visual understanding capabilities, we propose using document images with multi-granularity and multi-modal information to supplement natural images. In this light, we construct MMDocBench, a benchmark with various OCR-free document understanding tasks for the evaluation of fine-grained visual perception and reasoning abilities. MMDocBench defines 15 main tasks with 4,338 QA pairs and 11,353 supporting regions, covering various document images such as research papers, receipts, financial reports, Wikipedia tables, charts, and infographics. Based on MMDocBench, we conduct extensive experiments using 13 open-source and 3 proprietary advanced LVLMs, assessing their strengths and weaknesses across different tasks and document image types. The benchmark, task instructions, and evaluation code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Out-of-Distribution Generalization: Data Augmentation and Neural Architecture Search Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has been demonstrated with tremendous success in recent years. Despite so, its performance in practice often degenerates drastically when encountering out-of-distribution (OoD) data, i.e. training and test data are sampled from different distributions. In this thesis, we study ways toward robust OoD generalization for deep learning, i.e., its performance is not susceptible to distribution shift in the test data.
  We first propose a novel and effective approach to disentangle the spurious correlation between features that are not essential for recognition. It employs decomposed feature representation by orthogonalizing the two gradients of losses for category and context branches. Furthermore, we perform gradient-based augmentation on context-related features (e.g., styles, backgrounds, or scenes of target objects) to improve the robustness of learned representations. Results show that our approach generalizes well for different distribution shifts.
  We then study the problem of strengthening neural architecture search in OoD scenarios. We propose to optimize the architecture parameters that minimize the validation loss on synthetic OoD data, under the condition that corresponding network parameters minimize the training loss. Moreover, to obtain a proper validation set, we learn a conditional generator by maximizing their losses computed by different neural architectures. Results show that our approach effectively discovers robust architectures that perform well for OoD generalization.</description>

      <title>Multi-path Exploration and Feedback Adjustment for Text-to-Image Person Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-based person retrieval aims to identify the specific persons using textual descriptions as queries. Existing ad vanced methods typically depend on vision-language pre trained (VLP) models to facilitate effective cross-modal alignment. However, the inherent constraints of VLP mod-els, which include the global alignment biases and insuffi-cient self-feedback regulation, impede optimal retrieval per formance. In this paper, we propose MeFa, a Multi-Pathway Exploration, Feedback, and Adjustment framework, which deeply explores intrinsic feedback of intra and inter-modal to make targeted adjustment, thereby achieving more precise person-text associations. Specifically, we first design an intra modal reasoning pathway that generates hard negative sam ples for cross-modal data, leveraging feedback from these samples to refine intra-modal reasoning, thereby enhancing sensitivity to subtle discrepancies. Subsequently, we intro duce a cross-modal refinement pathway that utilizes both global information and intermodal feedback to refine local in formation, thus enhancing its global semantic representation. Finally, the discriminative clue correction pathway incorpo rates fine-grained features of secondary similarity as discrim inative clues to further mitigate retrieval failures caused by disparities in these features. Experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate that MeFa achieves superior person retrieval performance without necessitating additional data or complex structures.</description>

      <title>Domain Adaptation with a Single Vision-Language Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain adaptation has been extensively investigated in computer vision but still requires access to target data at the training time, which might be difficult to obtain in some uncommon conditions. In this paper, we present a new framework for domain adaptation relying on a single Vision-Language (VL) latent embedding instead of full target data. First, leveraging a contrastive language-image pre-training model (CLIP), we propose prompt/photo-driven instance normalization (PIN). PIN is a feature augmentation method that mines multiple visual styles using a single target VL latent embedding, by optimizing affine transformations of low-level source features. The VL embedding can come from a language prompt describing the target domain, a partially optimized language prompt, or a single unlabeled target image. Second, we show that these mined styles (i.e., augmentations) can be used for zero-shot (i.e., target-free) and one-shot unsupervised domain adaptation. Experiments on semantic segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperforms relevant baselines in the zero-shot and one-shot settings.</description>

      <title>SocialGPT: Prompting LLMs for Social Relation Reasoning via Greedy Segment Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social relation reasoning aims to identify relation categories such as friends, spouses, and colleagues from images. While current methods adopt the paradigm of training a dedicated network end-to-end using labeled image data, they are limited in terms of generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we first present a simple yet well-crafted framework named {\name}, which combines the perception capability of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) within a modular framework, providing a strong baseline for social relation recognition. Specifically, we instruct VFMs to translate image content into a textual social story, and then utilize LLMs for text-based reasoning. {\name} introduces systematic design principles to adapt VFMs and LLMs separately and bridge their gaps. Without additional model training, it achieves competitive zero-shot results on two databases while offering interpretable answers, as LLMs can generate language-based explanations for the decisions. The manual prompt design process for LLMs at the reasoning phase is tedious and an automated prompt optimization method is desired. As we essentially convert a visual classification task into a generative task of LLMs, automatic prompt optimization encounters a unique long prompt optimization issue. To address this issue, we further propose the Greedy Segment Prompt Optimization (GSPO), which performs a greedy search by utilizing gradient information at the segment level. Experimental results show that GSPO significantly improves performance, and our method also generalizes to different image styles. The code is available at https://github.com/Mengzibin/SocialGPT.</description>

      <title>TACO: Adversarial Camouflage Optimization on Trucks to Fool Object Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks threaten the reliability of machine learning models in critical applications like autonomous vehicles and defense systems. As object detectors become more robust with models like YOLOv8, developing effective adversarial methodologies is increasingly challenging. We present Truck Adversarial Camouflage Optimization (TACO), a novel framework that generates adversarial camouflage patterns on 3D vehicle models to deceive state-of-the-art object detectors. Adopting Unreal Engine 5, TACO integrates differentiable rendering with a Photorealistic Rendering Network to optimize adversarial textures targeted at YOLOv8. To ensure the generated textures are both effective in deceiving detectors and visually plausible, we introduce the Convolutional Smooth Loss function, a generalized smooth loss function. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that TACO significantly degrades YOLOv8's detection performance, achieving an AP@0.5 of 0.0099 on unseen test data. Furthermore, these adversarial patterns exhibit strong transferability to other object detection models such as Faster R-CNN and earlier YOLO versions.</description>

      <title>Constrained Transformer-Based Porous Media Generation to Spatial Distribution of Rock Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pore-scale modeling of rock images based on information in 3D micro-computed tomography data is crucial for studying complex subsurface processes such as CO2 and brine multiphase flow during Geologic Carbon Storage (GCS). While deep learning models can generate 3D rock microstructures that match static rock properties, they have two key limitations: they don't account for the spatial distribution of rock properties that can have an important influence on the flow and transport characteristics (such as permeability and relative permeability) of the rock and they generate structures below the representative elementary volume (REV) scale for those transport properties. Addressing these issues is crucial for building a consistent workflow between pore-scale analysis and field-scale modeling. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage modeling framework that combines a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE) and a transformer model for spatial upscaling and arbitrary-size 3D porous media reconstruction in an autoregressive manner. The VQVAE first compresses and quantizes sub-volume training images into low-dimensional tokens, while we train a transformer to spatially assemble these tokens into larger images following specific spatial order. By employing a multi-token generation strategy, our approach preserves both sub-volume integrity and spatial relationships among these sub-image patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our multi-token transformer generation approach and validate it using real data from a test well, showcasing its potential to generate models for the porous media at the well scale using only a spatial porosity model. The interpolated representative porous media that reflect field-scale geological properties accurately model transport properties, including permeability and multiphase flow relative permeability of CO2 and brine.</description>

      <title>AdvI2I: Adversarial Image Attack on Image-to-Image Diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly enhanced the quality of image synthesis, yet they have also introduced serious safety concerns, particularly the generation of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) content. Previous research has demonstrated that adversarial prompts can be used to generate NSFW content. However, such adversarial text prompts are often easily detectable by text-based filters, limiting their efficacy. In this paper, we expose a previously overlooked vulnerability: adversarial image attacks targeting Image-to-Image (I2I) diffusion models. We propose AdvI2I, a novel framework that manipulates input images to induce diffusion models to generate NSFW content. By optimizing a generator to craft adversarial images, AdvI2I circumvents existing defense mechanisms, such as Safe Latent Diffusion (SLD), without altering the text prompts. Furthermore, we introduce AdvI2I-Adaptive, an enhanced version that adapts to potential countermeasures and minimizes the resemblance between adversarial images and NSFW concept embeddings, making the attack more resilient against defenses. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that both AdvI2I and AdvI2I-Adaptive can effectively bypass current safeguards, highlighting the urgent need for stronger security measures to address the misuse of I2I diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Towards Multi-dimensional Explanation Alignment for Medical Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of interpretability in the field of medical image analysis has significant ethical and legal implications. Existing interpretable methods in this domain encounter several challenges, including dependency on specific models, difficulties in understanding and visualization, as well as issues related to efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework called Med-MICN (Medical Multi-dimensional Interpretable Concept Network). Med-MICN provides interpretability alignment for various angles, including neural symbolic reasoning, concept semantics, and saliency maps, which are superior to current interpretable methods. Its advantages include high prediction accuracy, interpretability across multiple dimensions, and automation through an end-to-end concept labeling process that reduces the need for extensive human training effort when working with new datasets. To demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of Med-MICN, we apply it to four benchmark datasets and compare it with baselines. The results clearly demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our Med-MICN.</description>

      <title>ECMamba: Consolidating Selective State Space Model with Retinex Guidance for Efficient Multiple Exposure Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exposure Correction (EC) aims to recover proper exposure conditions for images captured under over-exposure or under-exposure scenarios. While existing deep learning models have shown promising results, few have fully embedded Retinex theory into their architecture, highlighting a gap in current methodologies. Additionally, the balance between high performance and efficiency remains an under-explored problem for exposure correction task. Inspired by Mamba which demonstrates powerful and highly efficient sequence modeling, we introduce a novel framework based on Mamba for Exposure Correction (ECMamba) with dual pathways, each dedicated to the restoration of reflectance and illumination map, respectively. Specifically, we firstly derive the Retinex theory and we train a Retinex estimator capable of mapping inputs into two intermediary spaces, each approximating the target reflectance and illumination map, respectively. This setup facilitates the refined restoration process of the subsequent Exposure Correction Mamba Module (ECMM). Moreover, we develop a novel 2D Selective State-space layer guided by Retinex information (Retinex-SS2D) as the core operator of ECMM. This architecture incorporates an innovative 2D scanning strategy based on deformable feature aggregation, thereby enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness. Extensive experiment results and comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the outstanding performance and the importance of each component of our proposed ECMamba.

      <title>Detection of moving objects through turbulent media. Decomposition of Oscillatory vs Non-Oscillatory spatio-temporal vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how moving objects can be detected when images are impacted by atmospheric turbulence. We present a geometric spatio-temporal point of view to the problem and show that it is possible to distinguish movement due to the turbulence vs. moving objects. To perform this task, we propose an extension of 2D cartoon+texture decomposition algorithms to 3D vector fields. Our algorithm is based on curvelet spaces which permit to better characterize the movement flow geometry. We present experiments on real data which illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Going Beyond H&amp;E and Oncology: How Do Histopathology Foundation Models Perform for Multi-stain IHC and Immunology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the generalisation capabilities of state-of-the-art histopathology foundation models on out-of-distribution multi-stain autoimmune Immunohistochemistry datasets. We compare 13 feature extractor models, including ImageNet-pretrained networks, and histopathology foundation models trained on both public and proprietary data, on Rheumatoid Arthritis subtyping and Sjogren's Disease detection tasks. Using a simple Attention-Based Multiple Instance Learning classifier, we assess the transferability of learned representations from cancer H&amp;E images to autoimmune IHC images. Contrary to expectations, histopathology-pretrained models did not significantly outperform ImageNet-pretrained models. Furthermore, there was evidence of both autoimmune feature misinterpretation and biased feature importance. Our findings highlight the challenges in transferring knowledge from cancer to autoimmune histopathology and emphasise the need for careful evaluation of AI models across diverse histopathological tasks. The code to run this benchmark is available at https://github.com/AmayaGS/ImmunoHistoBench.</description>

      <title>Empirical curvelet based Fully Convolutional Network for supervised texture image segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach to perform supervised texture classification/segmentation. The proposed idea is to feed a Fully Convolutional Network with specific texture descriptors. These texture features are extracted from images by using an empirical curvelet transform. We propose a method to build a unique empirical curvelet filter bank adapted to a given dictionary of textures. We then show that the output of these filters can be used to build efficient texture descriptors utilized to finally feed deep learning networks. Our approach is finally evaluated on several datasets and compare the results to various state-of-the-art algorithms and show that the proposed method dramatically outperform all existing ones.</description>

      <title>MVSDet: Multi-View Indoor 3D Object Detection via Efficient Plane Sweeps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The key challenge of multi-view indoor 3D object detection is to infer accurate geometry information from images for precise 3D detection. Previous method relies on NeRF for geometry reasoning. However, the geometry extracted from NeRF is generally inaccurate, which leads to sub-optimal detection performance. In this paper, we propose MVSDet which utilizes plane sweep for geometry-aware 3D object detection. To circumvent the requirement for a large number of depth planes for accurate depth prediction, we design a probabilistic sampling and soft weighting mechanism to decide the placement of pixel features on the 3D volume. We select multiple locations that score top in the probability volume for each pixel and use their probability score to indicate the confidence. We further apply recent pixel-aligned Gaussian Splatting to regularize depth prediction and improve detection performance with little computation overhead. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and ARKitScenes datasets are conducted to show the superiority of our model. Our code is available at https://github.com/Pixie8888/MVSDet.</description>

      <title>ImageNet-RIB Benchmark: Large Pre-Training Datasets Don't Guarantee Robustness after Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly performant large-scale pre-trained models promise to also provide a valuable foundation for learning specialized tasks, by fine-tuning the model to the desired task. By starting from a good general-purpose model, the goal is to achieve both specialization in the target task and maintain robustness. To assess the robustness of models to out-of-distribution samples after fine-tuning on downstream datasets, we introduce a new robust fine-tuning benchmark, ImageNet-RIB (Robustness Inheritance Benchmark). The benchmark consists of a set of related but distinct specialized (downstream) tasks; pre-trained models are fine-tuned on one task in the set and their robustness is assessed on the rest, iterating across all tasks for fine-tuning and assessment. We find that the continual learning methods, EWC and LwF maintain robustness after fine-tuning though fine-tuning generally does reduce performance on generalization to related downstream tasks across models. Not surprisingly, models pre-trained on large and rich datasets exhibit higher initial robustness across datasets and suffer more pronounced degradation during fine-tuning. The distance between the pre-training and downstream datasets, measured by optimal transport, predicts this performance degradation on the pre-training dataset. However, counterintuitively, model robustness after fine-tuning on related downstream tasks is the worst when the pre-training dataset is the richest and the most diverse. This suggests that starting with the strongest foundation model is not necessarily the best approach for performance on specialist tasks. The benchmark thus offers key insights for developing more resilient fine-tuning strategies and building robust machine learning models. https://jd730.github.io/projects/ImageNet-RIB</description>

      <title>Topological numbers and their use to characterize simple points for 2D binary images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we adapt the two topological numbers, which have been proposed to efficiently characterize simple points in specific neighborhoods for 3D binary images, to the case of 2D binary images. Unlike the 3D case, we only use a single neighborhood to define these two topological numbers for the 2D case. Then, we characterize simple points either by using the two topological numbers or by a single topological number linked to another one condition. We compare the characterization of simple points by topological numbers with two other ones based on Hilditch crossing number and Yokoi number. We also highlight the number of possible configurations corresponding to a simple point, which also represents the maximum limit of local configurations that a thinning algorithm operating by parallel deletion of simple (individual) points may delete while preserving topology (limit usually not reachable, depending on the deletion strategy).</description>

      <title>NYC-Event-VPR: A Large-Scale High-Resolution Event-Based Visual Place Recognition Dataset in Dense Urban Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual place recognition (VPR) enables autonomous robots to identify previously visited locations, which contributes to tasks like simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). VPR faces challenges such as accurate image neighbor retrieval and appearance change in scenery. Event cameras, also known as dynamic vision sensors, are a new sensor modality for VPR and offer a promising solution to the challenges with their unique attributes: high temporal resolution (1MHz clock), ultra-low latency (in {\mu}s), and high dynamic range (&gt;120dB). These attributes make event cameras less susceptible to motion blur and more robust in variable lighting conditions, making them suitable for addressing VPR challenges. However, the scarcity of event-based VPR datasets, partly due to the novelty and cost of event cameras, hampers their adoption. To fill this data gap, our paper introduces the NYC-Event-VPR dataset to the robotics and computer vision communities, featuring the Prophesee IMX636 HD event sensor (1280x720 resolution), combined with RGB camera and GPS module. It encompasses over 13 hours of geotagged event data, spanning 260 kilometers across New York City, covering diverse lighting and weather conditions, day/night scenarios, and multiple visits to various locations. Furthermore, our paper employs three frameworks to conduct generalization performance assessments, promoting innovation in event-based VPR and its integration into robotics applications.</description>

      <title>OFER: Occluded Face Expression Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing 3D face models from a single image is an inherently ill-posed problem, which becomes even more challenging in the presence of occlusions. In addition to fewer available observations, occlusions introduce an extra source of ambiguity, where multiple reconstructions can be equally valid. Despite the ubiquity of the problem, very few methods address its multi-hypothesis nature. In this paper we introduce OFER, a novel approach for single image 3D face reconstruction that can generate plausible, diverse, and expressive 3D faces, even under strong occlusions. Specifically, we train two diffusion models to generate the shape and expression coefficients of a face parametric model, conditioned on the input image. This approach captures the multi-modal nature of the problem, generating a distribution of solutions as output. Although this addresses the ambiguity problem, the challenge remains to pick the best matching shape to ensure consistency across diverse expressions. To achieve this, we propose a novel ranking mechanism that sorts the outputs of the shape diffusion network based on the predicted shape accuracy scores to select the best match. We evaluate our method using standard benchmarks and introduce CO-545, a new protocol and dataset designed to assess the accuracy of expressive faces under occlusion. Our results show improved performance over occlusion-based methods, with added ability to generate multiple expressions for a given image.</description>

      <title>Adapting Diffusion Models for Improved Prompt Compliance and Controllable Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling with diffusion processes (DPs) enabled breakthroughs in image synthesis. Despite impressive image quality, these models have various prompt compliance problems, including low recall in generating multiple objects, difficulty in generating text in images, and meeting constraints like object locations and pose. For fine-grained editing and manipulation, they also require fine-grained semantic or instance maps that are tedious to produce manually. While prompt compliance can be enhanced by addition of loss functions at inference, this is time consuming and does not scale to complex scenes. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a new family of \textit{Factor Graph Diffusion Models} (FG-DMs) that models the joint distribution of images and conditioning variables, such as semantic, sketch, depth or normal maps via a factor graph decomposition. This joint structure has several advantages, including support for efficient sampling based prompt compliance schemes, which produce images of high object recall, semi-automated fine-grained editing, text-based editing of conditions with noise inversion, explainability at intermediate levels, ability to produce labeled datasets for the training of downstream models such as segmentation or depth, training with missing data, and continual learning where new conditioning variables can be added with minimal or no modifications to the existing structure. We propose an implementation of FG-DMs by adapting a pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) model to implement all FG-DM factors, using only COCO dataset, and show that it is effective in generating images with 15\% higher recall than SD while retaining its generalization ability. We introduce an attention distillation loss that encourages consistency among the attention maps of all factors, improving the fidelity of the generated conditions and image.</description>

      <title>Investigation of moving objects through atmospheric turbulence from a non-stationary platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we extract the optical flow field corresponding to moving objects from an image sequence of a scene impacted by atmospheric turbulence \emph{and} captured from a moving camera. Our procedure first computes the optical flow field and creates a motion model to compensate for the flow field induced by camera motion. After subtracting the motion model from the optical flow, we proceed with our previous work, Gilles et al~\cite{gilles2018detection}, where a spatial-temporal cartoon+texture inspired decomposition is performed on the motion-compensated flow field in order to separate flows corresponding to atmospheric turbulence and object motion. Finally, the geometric component is processed with the detection and tracking method and is compared against a ground truth. All of the sequences and code used in this work are open source and are available by contacting the authors.</description>

      <title>Neural Experts: Mixture of Experts for Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have proven effective in various tasks including image, shape, audio, and video reconstruction. These INRs typically learn the implicit field from sampled input points. This is often done using a single network for the entire domain, imposing many global constraints on a single function. In this paper, we propose a mixture of experts (MoE) implicit neural representation approach that enables learning local piece-wise continuous functions that simultaneously learns to subdivide the domain and fit locally. We show that incorporating a mixture of experts architecture into existing INR formulations provides a boost in speed, accuracy, and memory requirements. Additionally, we introduce novel conditioning and pretraining methods for the gating network that improves convergence to the desired solution. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on multiple reconstruction tasks, including surface reconstruction, image reconstruction, and audio signal reconstruction and show improved performance compared to non-MoE methods.</description>

      <title>On filter design in deep convolutional neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) in computer vision has given promising results. It is widely applied in many areas, from medicine, agriculture, self-driving car, biometric system, and almost all computer vision-based applications. Filters or weights are the critical elements responsible for learning in DCNN. Backpropagation has been the primary learning algorithm for DCNN and provides promising results, but the size and numbers of the filters remain hyper-parameters. Various studies have been done in the last decade on semi-supervised, self-supervised, and unsupervised methods and their properties. The effects of filter initialization, size-shape selection, and the number of filters on learning and optimization have not been investigated in a separate publication to collate all the options. Such attributes are often treated as hyper-parameters and lack mathematical understanding. Computer vision algorithms have many limitations in real-life applications, and understanding the learning process is essential to have some significant improvement. To the best of our knowledge, no separate investigation has been published discussing the filters; this is our primary motivation. This study focuses on arguments for choosing specific physical parameters of filters, initialization, and learning technic over scattered methods. The promising unsupervised approaches have been evaluated. Additionally, the limitations, current challenges, and future scope have been discussed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Encoding Error of SIRENs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs), which encode signals such as images, videos, and 3D shapes in the weights of neural networks, are becoming increasingly popular. Among their many applications is signal compression, for which there is great interest in achieving the highest possible fidelity to the original signal subject to constraints such as neural network size, training (encoding) and inference (decoding) time. But training INRs can be a computationally expensive process, making it challenging to determine the best possible tradeoff under such constraints. Towards this goal, we present a method which predicts the encoding error that a popular INR network (SIREN) will reach, given its network hyperparameters and the signal to encode. This method is trained on a unique dataset of 300,000 SIRENs, trained across a variety of images and hyperparameters. (Dataset available here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/predict-SIREN-PSNR/COIN-collection.) Our predictive method demonstrates the feasibility of this regression problem, and allows users to anticipate the encoding error that a SIREN network will reach in milliseconds instead of minutes or longer. We also provide insights into the behavior of SIREN networks, such as why narrow SIRENs can have very high random variation in encoding error, and how the performance of SIRENs relates to JPEG compression.</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of Super Resolution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several recent studies have demonstrated that deep-learning based image generation models, such as GANs, can be uniquely identified, and possibly even reverse-engineered, by the fingerprints they leave on their output images. We extend this research to single image super-resolution (SISR) networks. Compared to previously studied models, SISR networks are a uniquely challenging class of image generation model from which to extract and analyze fingerprints, as they can often generate images that closely match the corresponding ground truth and thus likely leave little flexibility to embed signatures. We take SISR models as examples to investigate if the findings from the previous work on fingerprints of GAN-based networks are valid for general image generation models. We show that SISR networks with a high upscaling factor or trained using adversarial loss leave highly distinctive fingerprints, and that under certain conditions, some SISR network hyperparameters can be reverse-engineered from these fingerprints.</description>

      <title>Discriminative Pedestrian Features and Gated Channel Attention for Clothes-Changing Person Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In public safety and social life, the task of Clothes-Changing Person Re-Identification (CC-ReID) has become increasingly significant. However, this task faces considerable challenges due to appearance changes caused by clothing alterations. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes an innovative method for disentangled feature extraction, effectively extracting discriminative features from pedestrian images that are invariant to clothing. This method leverages pedestrian parsing techniques to identify and retain features closely associated with individual identity while disregarding the variable nature of clothing attributes. Furthermore, this study introduces a gated channel attention mechanism, which, by adjusting the network's focus, aids the model in more effectively learning and emphasizing features critical for pedestrian identity recognition. Extensive experiments conducted on two standard CC-ReID datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with performance surpassing current leading solutions. The Top-1 accuracy under clothing change scenarios on the PRCC and VC-Clothes datasets reached 64.8% and 83.7%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Exploring Local Memorization in Diffusion Models via Bright Ending Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we identify and leverage a novel `bright ending' (BE) anomaly in diffusion models prone to memorizing training images to address a new task: locating localized memorization regions within these models. BE refers to a distinct cross-attention pattern observed in text-to-image generations using diffusion models. Specifically, memorized image patches exhibit significantly greater attention to the end token during the final inference step compared to non-memorized patches. This attention map effectively highlights regions where the generated image replicates training data. Furthermore, driven by our observation that local memorization significantly underperforms in existing tasks of measuring, detecting, and mitigating memorization in diffusion models compared to global memorization, we propose a simple yet effective method to integrate BE and the results of the new localization task into these existing frameworks. This integration effectively improves their performances by narrowing the performance gap caused by local memorization. Our results not only demonstrate the successful execution of the new localization task but also establish new state-of-the-art performance across all existing tasks, underscoring the significance of the BE phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Multi-Granularity Representation via Group Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Vehicle Re-identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicle re-identification (Vehicle ReID) aims at retrieving vehicle images across disjoint surveillance camera views. The majority of vehicle ReID research is heavily reliant upon supervisory labels from specific human-collected datasets for training. When applied to the large-scale real-world scenario, these models will experience dreadful performance declines due to the notable domain discrepancy between the source dataset and the target. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an unsupervised vehicle ReID framework (MGR-GCL). It integrates a multi-granularity CNN representation for learning discriminative transferable features and a contrastive learning module responsible for efficient domain adaptation in the unlabeled target domain. Specifically, after training the proposed Multi-Granularity Representation (MGR) on the labeled source dataset, we propose a group contrastive learning module (GCL) to generate pseudo labels for the target dataset, facilitating the domain adaptation process. We conducted extensive experiments and the results demonstrated our superiority against existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Investigating Memorization in Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models, widely used for image and video generation, face a significant limitation: the risk of memorizing and reproducing training data during inference, potentially generating unauthorized copyrighted content. While prior research has focused on image diffusion models (IDMs), video diffusion models (VDMs) remain underexplored. To address this gap, we first formally define the two types of memorization in VDMs (content memorization and motion memorization) in a practical way that focuses on privacy preservation and applies to all generation types. We then introduce new metrics specifically designed to separately assess content and motion memorization in VDMs. Additionally, we curate a dataset of text prompts that are most prone to triggering memorization when used as conditioning in VDMs. By leveraging these prompts, we generate diverse videos from various open-source VDMs, successfully extracting numerous training videos from each tested model. Through the application of our proposed metrics, we systematically analyze memorization across various pretrained VDMs, including text-conditional and unconditional models, on a variety of datasets. Our comprehensive study reveals that memorization is widespread across all tested VDMs, indicating that VDMs can also memorize image training data in addition to video datasets. Finally, we propose efficient and effective detection strategies for both content and motion memorization, offering a foundational approach for improving privacy in VDMs.</description>

      <title>AdaptGCD: Multi-Expert Adapter Tuning for Generalized Category Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different from the traditional semi-supervised learning paradigm that is constrained by the close-world assumption, Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) presumes that the unlabeled dataset contains new categories not appearing in the labeled set, and aims to not only classify old categories but also discover new categories in the unlabeled data. Existing studies on GCD typically devote to transferring the general knowledge from the self-supervised pretrained model to the target GCD task via some fine-tuning strategies, such as partial tuning and prompt learning. Nevertheless, these fine-tuning methods fail to make a sound balance between the generalization capacity of pretrained backbone and the adaptability to the GCD task. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel adapter-tuning-based method named AdaptGCD, which is the first work to introduce the adapter tuning into the GCD task and provides some key insights expected to enlighten future research. Furthermore, considering the discrepancy of supervision information between the old and new classes, a multi-expert adapter structure equipped with a route assignment constraint is elaborately devised, such that the data from old and new classes are separated into different expert groups. Extensive experiments are conducted on 7 widely-used datasets. The remarkable improvements in performance highlight the effectiveness of our proposals.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Modality Adaptation with Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their success, unsupervised domain adaptation methods for semantic segmentation primarily focus on adaptation between image domains and do not utilize other abundant visual modalities like depth, infrared and event. This limitation hinders their performance and restricts their application in real-world multimodal scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Modality Adaptation with text-to-image Diffusion Models (MADM) for semantic segmentation task which utilizes text-to-image diffusion models pre-trained on extensive image-text pairs to enhance the model's cross-modality capabilities. Specifically, MADM comprises two key complementary components to tackle major challenges. First, due to the large modality gap, using one modal data to generate pseudo labels for another modality suffers from a significant drop in accuracy. To address this, MADM designs diffusion-based pseudo-label generation which adds latent noise to stabilize pseudo-labels and enhance label accuracy. Second, to overcome the limitations of latent low-resolution features in diffusion models, MADM introduces the label palette and latent regression which converts one-hot encoded labels into the RGB form by palette and regresses them in the latent space, thus ensuring the pre-trained decoder for up-sampling to obtain fine-grained features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MADM achieves state-of-the-art adaptation performance across various modality tasks, including images to depth, infrared, and event modalities. We open-source our code and models at https://github.com/XiaRho/MADM.</description>

      <title>DiffSTR: Controlled Diffusion Models for Scene Text Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To prevent unauthorized use of text in images, Scene Text Removal (STR) has become a crucial task. It focuses on automatically removing text and replacing it with a natural, text-less background while preserving significant details such as texture, color, and contrast. Despite its importance in privacy protection, STR faces several challenges, including boundary artifacts, inconsistent texture and color, and preserving correct shadows. Most STR approaches estimate a text region mask to train a model, solving for image translation or inpainting to generate a text-free image. Thus, the quality of the generated image depends on the accuracy of the inpainting mask and the generator's capability. In this work, we leverage the superior capabilities of diffusion models in generating high-quality, consistent images to address the STR problem. We introduce a ControlNet diffusion model, treating STR as an inpainting task. To enhance the model's robustness, we develop a mask pretraining pipeline to condition our diffusion model. This involves training a masked autoencoder (MAE) using a combination of box masks and coarse stroke masks, and fine-tuning it using masks derived from our novel segmentation-based mask refinement framework. This framework iteratively refines an initial mask and segments it using the SLIC and Hierarchical Feature Selection (HFS) algorithms to produce an accurate final text mask. This improves mask prediction and utilizes rich textural information in natural scene images to provide accurate inpainting masks. Experiments on the SCUT-EnsText and SCUT-Syn datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>SS3DM: Benchmarking Street-View Surface Reconstruction with a Synthetic 3D Mesh Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing accurate 3D surfaces for street-view scenarios is crucial for applications such as digital entertainment and autonomous driving simulation. However, existing street-view datasets, including KITTI, Waymo, and nuScenes, only offer noisy LiDAR points as ground-truth data for geometric evaluation of reconstructed surfaces. These geometric ground-truths often lack the necessary precision to evaluate surface positions and do not provide data for assessing surface normals. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the SS3DM dataset, comprising precise \textbf{S}ynthetic \textbf{S}treet-view \textbf{3D} \textbf{M}esh models exported from the CARLA simulator. These mesh models facilitate accurate position evaluation and include normal vectors for evaluating surface normal. To simulate the input data in realistic driving scenarios for 3D reconstruction, we virtually drive a vehicle equipped with six RGB cameras and five LiDAR sensors in diverse outdoor scenes. Leveraging this dataset, we establish a benchmark for state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the associated challenges.

      <title>EI-Nexus: Towards Unmediated and Flexible Inter-Modality Local Feature Extraction and Matching for Event-Image Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras, with high temporal resolution and high dynamic range, have limited research on the inter-modality local feature extraction and matching of event-image data. We propose EI-Nexus, an unmediated and flexible framework that integrates two modality-specific keypoint extractors and a feature matcher. To achieve keypoint extraction across viewpoint and modality changes, we bring Local Feature Distillation (LFD), which transfers the viewpoint consistency from a well-learned image extractor to the event extractor, ensuring robust feature correspondence. Furthermore, with the help of Context Aggregation (CA), a remarkable enhancement is observed in feature matching. We further establish the first two inter-modality feature matching benchmarks, MVSEC-RPE and EC-RPE, to assess relative pose estimation on event-image data. Our approach outperforms traditional methods that rely on explicit modal transformation, offering more unmediated and adaptable feature extraction and matching, achieving better keypoint similarity and state-of-the-art results on the MVSEC-RPE and EC-RPE benchmarks. The source code and benchmarks will be made publicly available at https://github.com/ZhonghuaYi/EI-Nexus_official.</description>

      <title>MotionGPT-2: A General-Purpose Motion-Language Model for Motion Generation and Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating lifelike human motions from descriptive texts has experienced remarkable research focus in the recent years, propelled by the emerging requirements of digital humans.Despite impressive advances, existing approaches are often constrained by limited control modalities, task specificity, and focus solely on body motion representations.In this paper, we present MotionGPT-2, a unified Large Motion-Language Model (LMLM) that addresses these limitations. MotionGPT-2 accommodates multiple motion-relevant tasks and supporting multimodal control conditions through pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). It quantizes multimodal inputs-such as text and single-frame poses-into discrete, LLM-interpretable tokens, seamlessly integrating them into the LLM's vocabulary. These tokens are then organized into unified prompts, guiding the LLM to generate motion outputs through a pretraining-then-finetuning paradigm. We also show that the proposed MotionGPT-2 is highly adaptable to the challenging 3D holistic motion generation task, enabled by the innovative motion discretization framework, Part-Aware VQVAE, which ensures fine-grained representations of body and hand movements. Extensive experiments and visualizations validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating the adaptability of MotionGPT-2 across motion generation, motion captioning, and generalized motion completion tasks.</description>

      <title>Memory-Efficient Point Cloud Registration via Overlapping Region Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have improved 3D point cloud registration but increased graphics processing unit (GPU) memory usage, often requiring preliminary sampling that reduces accuracy. We propose an overlapping region sampling method to reduce memory usage while maintaining accuracy. Our approach estimates the overlapping region and intensively samples from it, using a k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) based point compression mechanism with multi layer perceptron (MLP) and transformer architectures. Evaluations on 3DMatch and 3DLoMatch datasets show our method outperforms other sampling methods in registration recall, especially at lower GPU memory levels. For 3DMatch, we achieve 94% recall with 33% reduced memory usage, with greater advantages in 3DLoMatch. Our method enables efficient large-scale point cloud registration in resource-constrained environments, maintaining high accuracy while significantly reducing memory requirements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes DOFS, a pilot dataset of 3D deformable objects (DOs) (e.g., elasto-plastic objects) with full spatial information (i.e., top, side, and bottom information) using a novel and low-cost data collection platform with a transparent operating plane. The dataset consists of active manipulation action, multi-view RGB-D images, well-registered point clouds, 3D deformed mesh, and 3D occupancy with semantics, using a pinching strategy with a two-parallel-finger gripper. In addition, we trained a neural network with the down-sampled 3D occupancy and action as input to model the dynamics of an elasto-plastic object. Our dataset and all CADs of the data collection system will be released soon on our website.</description>

      <title>IntLoRA: Integral Low-rank Adaptation of Quantized Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale text-to-image diffusion models for various downstream tasks has yielded impressive results. However, the heavy computational burdens of tuning large models prevent personal customization. Recent advances have attempted to employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to adapt the floating-point (FP) or quantized pre-trained weights. Nonetheless, the adaptation parameters in existing works are still restricted to FP arithmetic, hindering hardware-friendly acceleration. In this work, we propose IntLoRA, to further push the efficiency limits by using integer type (INT) low-rank parameters to adapt the quantized diffusion models. By working in the integer arithmetic, our IntLoRA offers three key advantages: (i) for fine-tuning, the pre-trained weights are quantized, reducing memory usage; (ii) for storage, both pre-trained and low-rank weights are in INT which consumes less disk space; (iii) for inference, IntLoRA weights can be naturally merged into quantized pre-trained weights through efficient integer multiplication or bit-shifting, eliminating additional post-training quantization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IntLoRA can achieve performance on par with or even superior to the vanilla LoRA, accompanied by significant efficiency improvements.

      <title>Fast-OMRA: Fast Online Motion Resolution Adaptation for Neural B-Frame Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most learned B-frame codecs with hierarchical temporal prediction suffer from the domain shift issue caused by the discrepancy in the Group-of-Pictures (GOP) size used for training and test. As such, the motion estimation network may fail to predict large motion properly. One effective strategy to mitigate this domain shift issue is to downsample video frames for motion estimation. However, finding the optimal downsampling factor involves a time-consuming rate-distortion optimization process. This work introduces lightweight classifiers to determine the downsampling factor. To strike a good rate-distortion-complexity trade-off, our classifiers observe simple state signals, including only the coding and reference frames, to predict the best downsampling factor. We present two variants that adopt binary and multi-class classifiers, respectively. The binary classifier adopts the Focal Loss for training, classifying between motion estimation at high and low resolutions. Our multi-class classifier is trained with novel soft labels incorporating the knowledge of the rate-distortion costs of different downsampling factors. Both variants operate as add-on modules without the need to re-train the B-frame codec. Experimental results confirm that they achieve comparable coding performance to the brute-force search methods while greatly reducing computational complexity.</description>

      <title>HairDiffusion: Vivid Multi-Colored Hair Editing via Latent Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hair editing is a critical image synthesis task that aims to edit hair color and hairstyle using text descriptions or reference images, while preserving irrelevant attributes (e.g., identity, background, cloth). Many existing methods are based on StyleGAN to address this task. However, due to the limited spatial distribution of StyleGAN, it struggles with multiple hair color editing and facial preservation. Considering the advancements in diffusion models, we utilize Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for hairstyle editing. Our approach introduces Multi-stage Hairstyle Blend (MHB), effectively separating control of hair color and hairstyle in diffusion latent space. Additionally, we train a warping module to align the hair color with the target region. To further enhance multi-color hairstyle editing, we fine-tuned a CLIP model using a multi-color hairstyle dataset. Our method not only tackles the complexity of multi-color hairstyles but also addresses the challenge of preserving original colors during diffusion editing. Extensive experiments showcase the superiority of our method in editing multi-color hairstyles while preserving facial attributes given textual descriptions and reference images.</description>

      <title>Text-Guided Attention is All You Need for Zero-Shot Robustness in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the impressive zero-shot capabilities, pre-trained vision-language models (e.g. CLIP), have attracted widespread attention and adoption across various domains. Nonetheless, CLIP has been observed to be susceptible to adversarial examples. Through experimental analysis, we have observed a phenomenon wherein adversarial perturbations induce shifts in text-guided attention. Building upon this observation, we propose a simple yet effective strategy: __Text-Guided Attention for Zero-Shot Robustness (TGA-ZSR)__. This framework incorporates two components: the Attention Refinement module and the Attention-based Model Constraint module. Our goal is to maintain the generalization of the CLIP model and enhance its adversarial robustness: The Attention Refinement module aligns the text-guided attention obtained from the target model via adversarial examples with the text-guided attention acquired from the original model via clean examples. This alignment enhances the model's robustness. Additionally, the Attention-based Model Constraint module acquires text-guided attention from both the target and original models using clean examples. Its objective is to maintain model performance on clean samples while enhancing overall robustness. The experiments validate that our method yields a 9.58\% enhancement in zero-shot robust accuracy over the current state-of-the-art techniques across 16 datasets. __Our code is available at__ https://github.com/zhyblue424/TGA-ZSR.</description>

      <title>A Fresh Look at Generalized Category Discovery through Non-negative Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify both base and novel images using labeled base data. However, current approaches inadequately address the intrinsic optimization of the co-occurrence matrix $\bar{A}$ based on cosine similarity, failing to achieve zero base-novel regions and adequate sparsity in base and novel domains. To address these deficiencies, we propose a Non-Negative Generalized Category Discovery (NN-GCD) framework. It employs Symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SNMF) as a mathematical medium to prove the equivalence of optimal K-means with optimal SNMF, and the equivalence of SNMF solver with non-negative contrastive learning (NCL) optimization. Utilizing these theoretical equivalences, it reframes the optimization of $\bar{A}$ and K-means clustering as an NCL optimization problem. Moreover, to satisfy the non-negative constraints and make a GCD model converge to a near-optimal region, we propose a GELU activation function and an NMF NCE loss. To transition $\bar{A}$ from a suboptimal state to the desired $\bar{A}^*$, we introduce a hybrid sparse regularization approach to impose sparsity constraints. Experimental results show NN-GCD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on GCD benchmarks, achieving an average accuracy of 66.1\% on the Semantic Shift Benchmark, surpassing prior counterparts by 4.7\%.</description>

      <title>SAM-Swin: SAM-Driven Dual-Swin Transformers with Adaptive Lesion Enhancement for Laryngo-Pharyngeal Tumor Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laryngo-pharyngeal cancer (LPC) is a highly lethal malignancy in the head and neck region. Recent advancements in tumor detection, particularly through dual-branch network architectures, have significantly improved diagnostic accuracy by integrating global and local feature extraction. However, challenges remain in accurately localizing lesions and fully capitalizing on the complementary nature of features within these branches. To address these issues, we propose SAM-Swin, an innovative SAM-driven Dual-Swin Transformer for laryngo-pharyngeal tumor detection. This model leverages the robust segmentation capabilities of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to achieve precise lesion segmentation. Meanwhile, we present a multi-scale lesion-aware enhancement module (MS-LAEM) designed to adaptively enhance the learning of nuanced complementary features across various scales, improving the quality of feature extraction and representation. Furthermore, we implement a multi-scale class-aware guidance (CAG) loss that delivers multi-scale targeted supervision, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to extract class-specific features. To validate our approach, we compiled three LPC datasets from the First Affiliated Hospital (FAHSYSU), the Sixth Affiliated Hospital (SAHSYSU) of Sun Yat-sen University, and Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University (NHSMU). The FAHSYSU dataset is utilized for internal training, while the SAHSYSU and NHSMU datasets serve for external evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAM-Swin outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its potential for advancing LPC detection and improving patient outcomes. The source code of SAM-Swin is available at the URL of \href{https://github.com/VVJia/SAM-Swin}{https://github.com/VVJia/SAM-Swin}.</description>

      <title>PK-YOLO: Pretrained Knowledge Guided YOLO for Brain Tumor Detection in Multiplanar MRI Slices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain tumor detection in multiplane Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) slices is a challenging task due to the various appearances and relationships in the structure of the multiplane images. In this paper, we propose a new You Only Look Once (YOLO)-based detection model that incorporates Pretrained Knowledge (PK), called PK-YOLO, to improve the performance for brain tumor detection in multiplane MRI slices. To our best knowledge, PK-YOLO is the first pretrained knowledge guided YOLO-based object detector. The main components of the new method are a pretrained pure lightweight convolutional neural network-based backbone via sparse masked modeling, a YOLO architecture with the pretrained backbone, and a regression loss function for improving small object detection. The pretrained backbone allows for feature transferability of object queries on individual plane MRI slices into the model encoders, and the learned domain knowledge base can improve in-domain detection. The improved loss function can further boost detection performance on small-size brain tumors in multiplanar two-dimensional MRI slices. Experimental results show that the proposed PK-YOLO achieves competitive performance on the multiplanar MRI brain tumor detection datasets compared to state-of-the-art YOLO-like and DETR-like object detectors.

      <title>Volumetric Conditioning Module to Control Pretrained Diffusion Models for 3D Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial control methods using additional modules on pretrained diffusion models have gained attention for enabling conditional generation in natural images. These methods guide the generation process with new conditions while leveraging the capabilities of large models. They could be beneficial as training strategies in the context of 3D medical imaging, where training a diffusion model from scratch is challenging due to high computational costs and data scarcity. However, the potential application of spatial control methods with additional modules to 3D medical images has not yet been explored. In this paper, we present a tailored spatial control method for 3D medical images with a novel lightweight module, Volumetric Conditioning Module (VCM). Our VCM employs an asymmetric U-Net architecture to effectively encode complex information from various levels of 3D conditions, providing detailed guidance in image synthesis. To examine the applicability of spatial control methods and the effectiveness of VCM for 3D medical data, we conduct experiments under single- and multimodal conditions scenarios across a wide range of dataset sizes, from extremely small datasets with 10 samples to large datasets with 500 samples. The experimental results show that the VCM is effective for conditional generation and efficient in terms of requiring less training data and computational resources. We further investigate the potential applications for our spatial control method through axial super-resolution for medical images.

      <title>Enhanced Survival Prediction in Head and Neck Cancer Using Convolutional Block Attention and Multimodal Data Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate survival prediction in head and neck cancer (HNC) is essential for guiding clinical decision-making and optimizing treatment strategies. Traditional models, such as Cox proportional hazards, have been widely used but are limited in their ability to handle complex multi-modal data. This paper proposes a deep learning-based approach leveraging CT and PET imaging modalities to predict survival outcomes in HNC patients. Our method integrates feature extraction with a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and a multi-modal data fusion layer that combines imaging data to generate a compact feature representation. The final prediction is achieved through a fully parametric discrete-time survival model, allowing for flexible hazard functions that overcome the limitations of traditional survival models. We evaluated our approach using the HECKTOR and HEAD-NECK-RADIOMICS- HN1 datasets, demonstrating its superior performance compared to conconventional statistical and machine learning models. The results indicate that our deep learning model significantly improves survival prediction accuracy, offering a robust tool for personalized treatment planning in HNC</description>

      <title>Diffusion as Reasoning: Enhancing Object Goal Navigation with LLM-Biased Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) task requires the agent to navigate to a specified target in an unseen environment. Since the environment layout is unknown, the agent needs to perform semantic reasoning to infer the potential location of the target, based on its accumulated memory of the environment during the navigation process. Diffusion models have been shown to be able to learn the distribution relationships between features in RGB images, and thus generate new realistic images.In this work, we propose a new approach to solving the ObjectNav task, by training a diffusion model to learn the statistical distribution patterns of objects in semantic maps, and using the map of the explored regions during navigation as the condition to generate the map of the unknown regions, thereby realizing the semantic reasoning of the target object, i.e., diffusion as reasoning (DAR). Meanwhile, we propose the global target bias and local LLM bias methods, where the former can constrain the diffusion model to generate the target object more effectively, and the latter utilizes the common sense knowledge extracted from the LLM to improve the generalization of the reasoning process. Based on the generated map in the unknown region, the agent sets the predicted location of the target as the goal and moves towards it. Experiments on Gibson and MP3D show the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Micro-Structures Graph-Based Point Cloud Registration for Balancing Efficiency and Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point Cloud Registration (PCR) is a fundamental and significant issue in photogrammetry and remote sensing, aiming to seek the optimal rigid transformation between sets of points. Achieving efficient and precise PCR poses a considerable challenge. We propose a novel micro-structures graph-based global point cloud registration method. The overall method is comprised of two stages. 1) Coarse registration (CR): We develop a graph incorporating micro-structures, employing an efficient graph-based hierarchical strategy to remove outliers for obtaining the maximal consensus set. We propose a robust GNC-Welsch estimator for optimization derived from a robust estimator to the outlier process in the Lie algebra space, achieving fast and robust alignment. 2) Fine registration (FR): To refine local alignment further, we use the octree approach to adaptive search plane features in the micro-structures. By minimizing the distance from the point-to-plane, we can obtain a more precise local alignment, and the process will also be addressed effectively by being treated as a planar adjustment algorithm combined with Anderson accelerated optimization (PA-AA). After extensive experiments on real data, our proposed method performs well on the 3DMatch and ETH datasets compared to the most advanced methods, achieving higher accuracy metrics and reducing the time cost by at least one-third.</description>

      <title>HRGR: Enhancing Image Manipulation Detection via Hierarchical Region-aware Graph Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image manipulation detection is to identify the authenticity of each pixel in images. One typical approach to uncover manipulation traces is to model image correlations.
  The previous methods commonly adopt the grids, which are fixed-size squares, as graph nodes to model correlations. However, these grids, being independent of image content, struggle to retain local content coherence, resulting in imprecise detection.
  To address this issue, we describe a new method named Hierarchical Region-aware Graph Reasoning (HRGR) to enhance image manipulation detection. Unlike existing grid-based methods, we model image correlations based on content-coherence feature regions with irregular shapes, generated by a novel Differentiable Feature Partition strategy. Then we construct a Hierarchical Region-aware Graph based on these regions within and across different feature layers. Subsequently, we describe a structural-agnostic graph reasoning strategy tailored for our graph to enhance the representation of nodes.
  Our method is fully differentiable and can seamlessly integrate into mainstream networks in an end-to-end manner, without requiring additional supervision.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in image manipulation detection, exhibiting its great potential as a plug-and-play component for existing architectures.</description>

      <title>Advancing Efficient Brain Tumor Multi-Class Classification -- New Insights from the Vision Mamba Model in Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of brain tumors is crucial for improving patient survival rates. However, the detection and classification of brain tumors are challenging due to their diverse types and complex morphological characteristics. This study investigates the application of pre-trained models for brain tumor classification, with a particular focus on deploying the Mamba model. We fine-tuned several mainstream transfer learning models and applied them to the multi-class classification of brain tumors. By comparing these models to those trained from scratch, we demonstrated the significant advantages of transfer learning, especially in the medical imaging field, where annotated data is often limited. Notably, we introduced the Vision Mamba (Vim), a novel network architecture, and applied it for the first time in brain tumor classification, achieving exceptional classification accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the Vim model achieved 100% classification accuracy on an independent test set, emphasizing its potential for tumor classification tasks. These findings underscore the effectiveness of transfer learning in brain tumor classification and reveal that, compared to existing state-of-the-art models, the Vim model is lightweight, efficient, and highly accurate, offering a new perspective for clinical applications. Furthermore, the framework proposed in this study for brain tumor classification, based on transfer learning and the Vision Mamba model, is broadly applicable to other medical imaging classification problems.</description>

      <title>Self-Relaxed Joint Training: Sample Selection for Severity Estimation with Ordinal Noisy Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Severity level estimation is a crucial task in medical image diagnosis. However, accurately assigning severity class labels to individual images is very costly and challenging. Consequently, the attached labels tend to be noisy. In this paper, we propose a new framework for training with ``ordinal'' noisy labels. Since severity levels have an ordinal relationship, we can leverage this to train a classifier while mitigating the negative effects of noisy labels. Our framework uses two techniques: clean sample selection and dual-network architecture. A technical highlight of our approach is the use of soft labels derived from noisy hard labels. By appropriately using the soft and hard labels in the two techniques, we achieve more accurate sample selection and robust network training. The proposed method outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in experiments using two endoscopic ulcerative colitis (UC) datasets and a retinal Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) dataset.

      <title>Multi-step feature fusion for natural disaster damage assessment on satellite images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quick and accurate assessment of the damage state of buildings after natural disasters is crucial for undertaking properly targeted rescue and subsequent recovery operations, which can have a major impact on the safety of victims and the cost of disaster recovery. The quality of such a process can be significantly improved by harnessing the potential of machine learning methods in computer vision. This paper presents a novel damage assessment method using an original multi-step feature fusion network for the classification of the damage state of buildings based on pre- and post-disaster large-scale satellite images. We introduce a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) module that performs feature fusion at multiple network levels between pre- and post-disaster images in the horizontal and vertical directions of CNN network. An additional network element - Fuse Module - was proposed to adapt any CNN model to analyze image pairs in the issue of pair classification. We use, open, large-scale datasets (IDA-BD and xView2) to verify, that the proposed method is suitable to improve on existing state-of-the-art architectures. We report over a 3 percentage point increase in the accuracy of the Vision Transformer model.</description>

      <title>Structured Analysis and Comparison of Alphabets in Historical Handwritten Ciphers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Historical ciphered manuscripts are documents that were typically used in sensitive communications within military and diplomatic contexts or among members of secret societies. These secret messages were concealed by inventing a method of writing employing symbols from diverse sources such as digits, alchemy signs and Latin or Greek characters. When studying a new, unseen cipher, the automatic search and grouping of ciphers with a similar alphabet can aid the scholar in its transcription and cryptanalysis because it indicates a probability that the underlying cipher is similar. In this study, we address this need by proposing the CSI metric, a novel way of comparing pairs of ciphered documents. We assess their effectiveness in an unsupervised clustering scenario utilising visual features, including SIFT, pre-trained learnt embeddings, and OCR descriptors.</description>

      <title>ReMix: Training Generalized Person Re-identification on a Mixture of Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern person re-identification (Re-ID) methods have a weak generalization ability and experience a major accuracy drop when capturing environments change. This is because existing multi-camera Re-ID datasets are limited in size and diversity, since such data is difficult to obtain. At the same time, enormous volumes of unlabeled single-camera records are available. Such data can be easily collected, and therefore, it is more diverse. Currently, single-camera data is used only for self-supervised pre-training of Re-ID methods. However, the diversity of single-camera data is suppressed by fine-tuning on limited multi-camera data after pre-training. In this paper, we propose ReMix, a generalized Re-ID method jointly trained on a mixture of limited labeled multi-camera and large unlabeled single-camera data. Effective training of our method is achieved through a novel data sampling strategy and new loss functions that are adapted for joint use with both types of data. Experiments show that ReMix has a high generalization ability and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalizable person Re-ID. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores joint training on a mixture of multi-camera and single-camera data in person Re-ID.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal Transformers for Action Unit Classification with Event Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face analysis has been studied from different angles to infer emotion, poses, shapes, and landmarks. Traditionally RGB cameras are used, yet for fine-grained tasks standard sensors might not be up to the task due to their latency, making it impossible to record and detect micro-movements that carry a highly informative signal, which is necessary for inferring the true emotions of a subject. Event cameras have been increasingly gaining interest as a possible solution to this and similar high-frame rate tasks. We propose a novel spatiotemporal Vision Transformer model that uses Shifted Patch Tokenization (SPT) and Locality Self-Attention (LSA) to enhance the accuracy of Action Unit classification from event streams. We also address the lack of labeled event data in the literature, which can be considered one of the main causes of an existing gap between the maturity of RGB and neuromorphic vision models. Gathering data is harder in the event domain since it cannot be crawled from the web and labeling frames should take into account event aggregation rates and the fact that static parts might not be visible in certain frames. To this end, we present FACEMORPHIC, a temporally synchronized multimodal face dataset composed of RGB videos and event streams. The dataset is annotated at a video level with facial Action Units and contains streams collected with various possible applications, ranging from 3D shape estimation to lip-reading. We then show how temporal synchronization can allow effective neuromorphic face analysis without the need to manually annotate videos: we instead leverage cross-modal supervision bridging the domain gap by representing face shapes in a 3D space. Our proposed model outperforms baseline methods by effectively capturing spatial and temporal information, crucial for recognizing subtle facial micro-expressions.</description>

      <title>FakeFormer: Efficient Vulnerability-Driven Transformers for Generalisable Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved unprecedented effectiveness in the general domain of image classification. Nonetheless, these models remain underexplored in the field of deepfake detection, given their lower performance as compared to Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) in that specific context. In this paper, we start by investigating why plain ViT architectures exhibit a suboptimal performance when dealing with the detection of facial forgeries. Our analysis reveals that, as compared to CNNs, ViT struggles to model localized forgery artifacts that typically characterize deepfakes. Based on this observation, we propose a deepfake detection framework called FakeFormer, which extends ViTs to enforce the extraction of subtle inconsistency-prone information. For that purpose, an explicit attention learning guided by artifact-vulnerable patches and tailored to ViTs is introduced. Extensive experiments are conducted on diverse well-known datasets, including FF++, Celeb-DF, WildDeepfake, DFD, DFDCP, and DFDC. The results show that FakeFormer outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of generalization and computational cost, without the need for large-scale training datasets. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/10Ring/FakeFormer}.</description>

      <title>PrefPaint: Aligning Image Inpainting Diffusion Model with Human Preference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we make the first attempt to align diffusion models for image inpainting with human aesthetic standards via a reinforcement learning framework, significantly improving the quality and visual appeal of inpainted images. Specifically, instead of directly measuring the divergence with paired images, we train a reward model with the dataset we construct, consisting of nearly 51,000 images annotated with human preferences. Then, we adopt a reinforcement learning process to fine-tune the distribution of a pre-trained diffusion model for image inpainting in the direction of higher reward. Moreover, we theoretically deduce the upper bound on the error of the reward model, which illustrates the potential confidence of reward estimation throughout the reinforcement alignment process, thereby facilitating accurate regularization. Extensive experiments on inpainting comparison and downstream tasks, such as image extension and 3D reconstruction, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing significant improvements in the alignment of inpainted images with human preference compared with state-of-the-art methods. This research not only advances the field of image inpainting but also provides a framework for incorporating human preference into the iterative refinement of generative models based on modeling reward accuracy, with broad implications for the design of visually driven AI applications. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://prefpaint.github.io.</description>

      <title>BenchX: A Unified Benchmark Framework for Medical Vision-Language Pretraining on Chest X-Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Pretraining (MedVLP) shows promise in learning generalizable and transferable visual representations from paired and unpaired medical images and reports. MedVLP can provide useful features to downstream tasks and facilitate adapting task-specific models to new setups using fewer examples. However, existing MedVLP methods often differ in terms of datasets, preprocessing, and finetuning implementations. This pose great challenges in evaluating how well a MedVLP method generalizes to various clinically-relevant tasks due to the lack of unified, standardized, and comprehensive benchmark. To fill this gap, we propose BenchX, a unified benchmark framework that enables head-to-head comparison and systematical analysis between MedVLP methods using public chest X-ray datasets. Specifically, BenchX is composed of three components: 1) Comprehensive datasets covering nine datasets and four medical tasks; 2) Benchmark suites to standardize data preprocessing, train-test splits, and parameter selection; 3) Unified finetuning protocols that accommodate heterogeneous MedVLP methods for consistent task adaptation in classification, segmentation, and report generation, respectively. Utilizing BenchX, we establish baselines for nine state-of-the-art MedVLP methods and found that the performance of some early MedVLP methods can be enhanced to surpass more recent ones, prompting a revisiting of the developments and conclusions from prior works in MedVLP. Our code are available at https://github.com/yangzhou12/BenchX.</description>

      <title>A Survey on RGB, 3D, and Multimodal Approaches for Unsupervised Industrial Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the advancement of industrial informatization, Unsupervised Industrial Anomaly Detection (UIAD) technology effectively overcomes the scarcity of abnormal samples and significantly enhances the automation and reliability of smart manufacturing. While RGB, 3D, and multimodal anomaly detection have demonstrated comprehensive and robust capabilities within the industrial informatization sector, existing reviews on industrial anomaly detection have not sufficiently classified and discussed methods in 3D and multimodal settings. We focus on 3D UIAD and multimodal UIAD, providing a comprehensive summary of unsupervised industrial anomaly detection in three modal settings. Firstly, we compare our surveys with recent works, introducing commonly used datasets, evaluation metrics, and the definitions of anomaly detection problems. Secondly, we summarize five research paradigms in RGB, 3D and multimodal UIAD and three emerging industrial manufacturing optimization directions in RGB UIAD, and review three multimodal feature fusion strategies in multimodal settings. Finally, we outline the primary challenges currently faced by UIAD in three modal settings, and offer insights into future development directions, aiming to provide researchers with a thorough reference and offer new perspectives for the advancement of industrial informatization.

      <title>From Explicit Rules to Implicit Reasoning in an Interpretable Violence Monitoring System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, research based on pre-trained models has demonstrated outstanding performance in violence surveillance tasks. However, these black-box systems face challenges regarding explainability during training and inference processes. An important question is how to incorporate explicit knowledge into these implicit models, thereby designing expert-driven and interpretable violence surveillance systems. This paper proposes a new paradigm for weakly supervised violence monitoring (WSVM) called Rule base Violence monitoring (RuleVM). The proposed RuleVM uses a dual-branch structure for different designs for images and text. One of the branches is called the implicit branch, which uses only visual features for coarse-grained binary classification. In this branch, image feature extraction is divided into two channels: one responsible for extracting scene frames and the other focusing on extracting actions. The other branch is called the explicit branch, which utilizes language-image alignment to perform fine-grained classification. For the language channel design in the explicit branch, the proposed RuleCLIP uses the state-of-the-art YOLO-World model to detect objects and actions in video frames, and association rules are identified through data mining methods as descriptions of the video. Leveraging the dual?branch architecture, RuleVM achieves interpretable coarse?grained and fine-grained violence surveillance. Extensive experiments were conducted on two commonly used benchmarks, and the results show that RuleCLIP achieved the best performance in both coarse-grained and fine-grained detection, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, interpretability experiments uncovered some interesting rules, such as the observation that as the number of people increases, the risk level of violent behavior also rises.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning-Based Secure Face Verification Scheme and Its Applications to Digital Surveillance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face verification is a well-known image analysis application and is widely used to recognize individuals in contemporary society. However, most real-world recognition systems ignore the importance of protecting the identity-sensitive facial images that are used for verification. To address this problem, we investigate how to implement a secure face verification system that protects the facial images from being imitated. In our work, we use the DeepID2 convolutional neural network to extract the features of a facial image and an EM algorithm to solve the facial verification problem. To maintain the privacy of facial images, we apply homomorphic encryption schemes to encrypt the facial data and compute the EM algorithm in the ciphertext domain. We develop three face verification systems for surveillance (or entrance) control of a local community based on three levels of privacy concerns. The associated timing performances are presented to demonstrate their feasibility for practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Feature distribution Adaptation Network for Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel deep inductive transfer learning framework, named feature distribution adaptation network, to tackle the challenging multi-modal speech emotion recognition problem. Our method aims to use deep transfer learning strategies to align visual and audio feature distributions to obtain consistent representation of emotion, thereby improving the performance of speech emotion recognition. In our model, the pre-trained ResNet-34 is utilized for feature extraction for facial expression images and acoustic Mel spectrograms, respectively. Then, the cross-attention mechanism is introduced to model the intrinsic similarity relationships of multi-modal features. Finally, the multi-modal feature distribution adaptation is performed efficiently with feed-forward network, which is extended using the local maximum mean discrepancy loss. Experiments are carried out on two benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate that our model can achieve excellent performance compared with existing ones.Our code is available at https://github.com/shaokai1209/FDAN.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Human and Automated Prompting in the Segment Anything Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for tackling image segmentation tasks in an intuitive and interactive manner has sparked interest in the design of effective visual prompts. Such interest has led to the creation of automated point prompt selection strategies, typically motivated from a feature extraction perspective. However, there is still very little understanding of how appropriate these automated visual prompting strategies are, particularly when compared to humans, across diverse image domains. Additionally, the performance benefits of including such automated visual prompting strategies within the finetuning process of SAM also remains unexplored, as does the effect of interpretable factors like distance between the prompt points on segmentation performance. To bridge these gaps, we leverage a recently released visual prompting dataset, PointPrompt, and introduce a number of benchmarking tasks that provide an array of opportunities to improve the understanding of the way human prompts differ from automated ones and what underlying factors make for effective visual prompts. We demonstrate that the resulting segmentation scores obtained by humans are approximately 29% higher than those given by automated strategies and identify potential features that are indicative of prompting performance with $R^2$ scores over 0.5. Additionally, we demonstrate that performance when using automated methods can be improved by up to 68% via a finetuning approach. Overall, our experiments not only showcase the existing gap between human prompts and automated methods, but also highlight potential avenues through which this gap can be leveraged to improve effective visual prompt design.

      <title>FreeGaussian: Guidance-free Controllable 3D Gaussian Splats with Flow Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing controllable Gaussian splats from monocular video is a challenging task due to its inherently insufficient constraints. Widely adopted approaches supervise complex interactions with additional masks and control signal annotations, limiting their real-world applications. In this paper, we propose an annotation guidance-free method, dubbed FreeGaussian, that mathematically derives dynamic Gaussian motion from optical flow and camera motion using novel dynamic Gaussian constraints. By establishing a connection between 2D flows and 3D Gaussian dynamic control, our method enables self-supervised optimization and continuity of dynamic Gaussian motions from flow priors. Furthermore, we introduce a 3D spherical vector controlling scheme, which represents the state with a 3D Gaussian trajectory, thereby eliminating the need for complex 1D control signal calculations and simplifying controllable Gaussian modeling. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art visual performance and control capability of our method.

      <title>HRPVT: High-Resolution Pyramid Vision Transformer for medium and small-scale human pose estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human pose estimation on medium and small scales has long been a significant challenge in this field. Most existing methods focus on restoring high-resolution feature maps by stacking multiple costly deconvolutional layers or by continuously aggregating semantic information from low-resolution feature maps while maintaining high-resolution ones, which can lead to information redundancy. Additionally, due to quantization errors, heatmap-based methods have certain disadvantages in accurately locating keypoints of medium and small-scale human figures. In this paper, we propose HRPVT, which utilizes PVT v2 as the backbone to model long-range dependencies. Building on this, we introduce the High-Resolution Pyramid Module (HRPM), designed to generate higher quality high-resolution representations by incorporating the intrinsic inductive biases of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) into the high-resolution feature maps. The integration of HRPM enhances the performance of pure transformer-based models for human pose estimation at medium and small scales. Furthermore, we replace the heatmap-based method with SimCC approach, which eliminates the need for costly upsampling layers, thereby allowing us to allocate more computational resources to HRPM. To accommodate models with varying parameter scales, we have developed two insertion strategies of HRPM, each designed to enhancing the model's ability to perceive medium and small-scale human poses from two distinct perspectives.</description>

      <title>TractShapeNet: Efficient Multi-Shape Learning with 3D Tractography Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain imaging studies have demonstrated that diffusion MRI tractography geometric shape descriptors can inform the study of the brain's white matter pathways and their relationship to brain function. In this work, we investigate the possibility of utilizing a deep learning model to compute shape measures of the brain's white matter connections. We introduce a novel framework, TractShapeNet, that leverages a point cloud representation of tractography to compute five shape measures: length, span, volume, total surface area, and irregularity. We assess the performance of the method on a large dataset including 1065 healthy young adults. Experiments for shape measure computation demonstrate that our proposed TractShapeNet outperforms other point cloud-based neural network models in both the Pearson correlation coefficient and normalized error metrics. We compare the inference runtime results with the conventional shape computation tool DSI-Studio. Our results demonstrate that a deep learning approach enables faster and more efficient shape measure computation. We also conduct experiments on two downstream language cognition prediction tasks, showing that shape measures from TractShapeNet perform similarly to those computed by DSI-Studio. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/SlicerDMRI/TractShapeNet.</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral Imaging-Based Perception in Autonomous Driving Scenarios: Benchmarking Baseline Semantic Segmentation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) is known for its advantages over traditional RGB imaging in remote sensing, agriculture, and medicine. Recently, it has gained attention for enhancing Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) perception. Several HSI datasets such as HyKo, HSI-Drive, HSI-Road, and Hyperspectral City have been made available. However, a comprehensive evaluation of semantic segmentation models (SSM) using these datasets is lacking. To address this gap, we evaluated the available annotated HSI datasets on four deep learning-based baseline SSMs: DeepLab v3+, HRNet, PSPNet, and U-Net, along with its two variants: Coordinate Attention (UNet-CA) and Convolutional Block-Attention Module (UNet-CBAM). The original model architectures were adapted to handle the varying spatial and spectral dimensions of the datasets. These baseline SSMs were trained using a class-weighted loss function for individual HSI datasets and evaluated using mean-based metrics such as intersection over union (IoU), recall, precision, F1 score, specificity, and accuracy. Our results indicate that UNet-CBAM, which extracts channel-wise features, outperforms other SSMs and shows potential to leverage spectral information for enhanced semantic segmentation. This study establishes a baseline SSM benchmark on available annotated datasets for future evaluation of HSI-based ADAS perception. However, limitations of current HSI datasets, such as limited dataset size, high class imbalance, and lack of fine-grained annotations, remain significant constraints for developing robust SSMs for ADAS applications.</description>

      <title>PF3plat: Pose-Free Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of novel view synthesis from unposed images in a single feed-forward. Our framework capitalizes on fast speed, scalability, and high-quality 3D reconstruction and view synthesis capabilities of 3DGS, where we further extend it to offer a practical solution that relaxes common assumptions such as dense image views, accurate camera poses, and substantial image overlaps. We achieve this through identifying and addressing unique challenges arising from the use of pixel-aligned 3DGS: misaligned 3D Gaussians across different views induce noisy or sparse gradients that destabilize training and hinder convergence, especially when above assumptions are not met. To mitigate this, we employ pre-trained monocular depth estimation and visual correspondence models to achieve coarse alignments of 3D Gaussians. We then introduce lightweight, learnable modules to refine depth and pose estimates from the coarse alignments, improving the quality of 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Furthermore, the refined estimates are leveraged to estimate geometry confidence scores, which assess the reliability of 3D Gaussian centers and condition the prediction of Gaussian parameters accordingly. Extensive evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that PF3plat sets a new state-of-the-art across all benchmarks, supported by comprehensive ablation studies validating our design choices.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Frequency Masker for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) is proposed to first pre-train the model on a large-scale source-domain dataset, and then transfer the model to data-scarce target-domain datasets for pixel-level segmentation. The significant domain gap between the source and target datasets leads to a sharp decline in the performance of existing few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods in cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we discover an intriguing phenomenon: simply filtering different frequency components for target domains can lead to a significant performance improvement, sometimes even as high as 14% mIoU. Then, we delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation, and find such improvements stem from the reduced inter-channel correlation in feature maps, which benefits CD-FSS with enhanced robustness against domain gaps and larger activated regions for segmentation. Based on this, we propose a lightweight frequency masker, which further reduces channel correlations by an amplitude-phase-masker (APM) module and an Adaptive Channel Phase Attention (ACPA) module. Notably, APM introduces only 0.01% additional parameters but improves the average performance by over 10%, and ACPA imports only 2.5% parameters but further improves the performance by over 1.5%, which significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art CD-FSS methods.</description>

      <title>Lighten CARAFE: Dynamic Lightweight Upsampling with Guided Reassemble Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a fundamental operation in modern machine vision models, feature upsampling has been widely used and investigated in the literatures. An ideal upsampling operation should be lightweight, with low computational complexity. That is, it can not only improve the overall performance but also not affect the model complexity. Content-aware Reassembly of Features (CARAFE) is a well-designed learnable operation to achieve feature upsampling. Albeit encouraging performance achieved, this method requires generating large-scale kernels, which brings a mass of extra redundant parameters, and inherently has limited scalability. To this end, we propose a lightweight upsampling operation, termed Dynamic Lightweight Upsampling (DLU) in this paper. In particular, it first constructs a small-scale source kernel space, and then samples the large-scale kernels from the kernel space by introducing learnable guidance offsets, hence avoiding introducing a large collection of trainable parameters in upsampling. Experiments on several mainstream vision tasks show that our DLU achieves comparable and even better performance to the original CARAFE, but with much lower complexity, e.g., DLU requires 91% fewer parameters and at least 63% fewer FLOPs (Floating Point Operations) than CARAFE in the case of 16x upsampling, but outperforms the CARAFE by 0.3% mAP in object detection.

      <title>Capacity Control is an Effective Memorization Mitigation Mechanism in Text-Conditional Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present compelling evidence that controlling model capacity during fine-tuning can effectively mitigate memorization in diffusion models. Specifically, we demonstrate that adopting Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) within the pre-train fine-tune paradigm significantly reduces memorization compared to traditional full fine-tuning approaches. Our experiments utilize the MIMIC dataset, which comprises image-text pairs of chest X-rays and their corresponding reports. The results, evaluated through a range of memorization and generation quality metrics, indicate that PEFT not only diminishes memorization but also enhances downstream generation quality. Additionally, PEFT methods can be seamlessly combined with existing memorization mitigation techniques for further improvement.

      <title>Shining a Light on Hurricane Damage Estimation via Nighttime Light Data: Pre-processing Matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amidst escalating climate change, hurricanes are inflicting severe socioeconomic impacts, marked by heightened economic losses and increased displacement. Previous research utilized nighttime light data to predict the impact of hurricanes on economic losses. However, prior work did not provide a thorough analysis of the impact of combining different techniques for pre-processing nighttime light (NTL) data. Addressing this gap, our research explores a variety of NTL pre-processing techniques, including value thresholding, built masking, and quality filtering and imputation, applied to two distinct datasets, VSC-NTL and VNP46A2, at the zip code level. Experiments evaluate the correlation of the denoised NTL data with economic damages of Category 4-5 hurricanes in Florida. They reveal that the quality masking and imputation technique applied to VNP46A2 show a substantial correlation with economic damage data.</description>

      <title>Multi-Level Feature Distillation of Joint Teachers Trained on Distinct Image Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel teacher-student framework to distill knowledge from multiple teachers trained on distinct datasets. Each teacher is first trained from scratch on its own dataset. Then, the teachers are combined into a joint architecture, which fuses the features of all teachers at multiple representation levels. The joint teacher architecture is fine-tuned on samples from all datasets, thus gathering useful generic information from all data samples. Finally, we employ a multi-level feature distillation procedure to transfer the knowledge to a student model for each of the considered datasets. We conduct image classification experiments on seven benchmarks, and action recognition experiments on three benchmarks. To illustrate the power of our feature distillation procedure, the student architectures are chosen to be identical to those of the individual teachers. To demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, we combine teachers with distinct architectures. We show that our novel Multi-Level Feature Distillation (MLFD) can significantly surpass equivalent architectures that are either trained on individual datasets, or jointly trained on all datasets at once. Furthermore, we confirm that each step of the proposed training procedure is well motivated by a comprehensive ablation study. We publicly release our code at https://github.com/AdrianIordache/MLFD.</description>

      <title>Active Learning for Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance on a wide range of downstream computer vision tasks. However, there still exists a considerable performance gap between these models and a supervised deep model trained on a downstream dataset. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel active learning (AL) framework that enhances the zero-shot classification performance of VLMs by selecting only a few informative samples from the unlabeled data for annotation during training. To achieve this, our approach first calibrates the predicted entropy of VLMs and then utilizes a combination of self-uncertainty and neighbor-aware uncertainty to calculate a reliable uncertainty measure for active sample selection. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms existing AL approaches on several image classification datasets, and significantly enhances the zero-shot performance of VLMs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an accurate and robust Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline named LiVisSfM, which is an SfM-based reconstruction system that fully combines LiDAR and visual cues. Unlike most existing LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) and LiDAR-inertial-visual odometry (LIVO) methods relying heavily on LiDAR registration coupled with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), we propose a LiDAR-visual SfM method which innovatively carries out LiDAR frame registration to LiDAR voxel map in a Point-to-Gaussian residual metrics, combined with a LiDAR-visual BA and explicit loop closure in a bundle optimization way to achieve accurate and robust LiDAR pose estimation without dependence on IMU incorporation. Besides, we propose an incremental voxel updating strategy for efficient voxel map updating during the process of LiDAR frame registration and LiDAR-visual BA optimization. Experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our LiVisSfM framework over state-of-the-art LIO and LIVO works on more accurate and robust LiDAR pose recovery and dense point cloud reconstruction of both public KITTI benchmark and a variety of self-captured dataset.</description>

      <title>Towards Unifying Understanding and Generation in the Era of Vision Foundation Models: A Survey from the Autoregression Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregression in large language models (LLMs) has shown impressive scalability by unifying all language tasks into the next token prediction paradigm. Recently, there is a growing interest in extending this success to vision foundation models. In this survey, we review the recent advances and discuss future directions for autoregressive vision foundation models. First, we present the trend for next generation of vision foundation models, i.e., unifying both understanding and generation in vision tasks. We then analyze the limitations of existing vision foundation models, and present a formal definition of autoregression with its advantages. Later, we categorize autoregressive vision foundation models from their vision tokenizers and autoregression backbones. Finally, we discuss several promising research challenges and directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey to comprehensively summarize autoregressive vision foundation models under the trend of unifying understanding and generation.

      <title>ContextIQ: A Multimodal Expert-Based Video Retrieval System for Contextual Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextual advertising serves ads that are aligned to the content that the user is viewing. The rapid growth of video content on social platforms and streaming services, along with privacy concerns, has increased the need for contextual advertising. Placing the right ad in the right context creates a seamless and pleasant ad viewing experience, resulting in higher audience engagement and, ultimately, better ad monetization. From a technology standpoint, effective contextual advertising requires a video retrieval system capable of understanding complex video content at a very granular level. Current text-to-video retrieval models based on joint multimodal training demand large datasets and computational resources, limiting their practicality and lacking the key functionalities required for ad ecosystem integration. We introduce ContextIQ, a multimodal expert-based video retrieval system designed specifically for contextual advertising. ContextIQ utilizes modality-specific experts-video, audio, transcript (captions), and metadata such as objects, actions, emotion, etc.-to create semantically rich video representations. We show that our system, without joint training, achieves better or comparable results to state-of-the-art models and commercial solutions on multiple text-to-video retrieval benchmarks. Our ablation studies highlight the benefits of leveraging multiple modalities for enhanced video retrieval accuracy instead of using a vision-language model alone. Furthermore, we show how video retrieval systems such as ContextIQ can be used for contextual advertising in an ad ecosystem while also addressing concerns related to brand safety and filtering inappropriate content.</description>

      <title>NCA-Morph: Medical Image Registration with Neural Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image registration is a critical process that aligns various patient scans, facilitating tasks like diagnosis, surgical planning, and tracking. Traditional optimization based methods are slow, prompting the use of Deep Learning (DL) techniques, such as VoxelMorph and Transformer-based strategies, for faster results. However, these DL methods often impose significant resource demands. In response to these challenges, we present NCA-Morph, an innovative approach that seamlessly blends DL with a bio-inspired communication and networking approach, enabled by Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs). NCA-Morph not only harnesses the power of DL for efficient image registration but also builds a network of local communications between cells and respective voxels over time, mimicking the interaction observed in living systems. In our extensive experiments, we subject NCA-Morph to evaluations across three distinct 3D registration tasks, encompassing Brain, Prostate and Hippocampus images from both healthy and diseased patients. The results showcase NCA-Morph's ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Notably, NCA-Morph distinguishes itself as a lightweight architecture with significantly fewer parameters; 60% and 99.7% less than VoxelMorph and TransMorph. This characteristic positions NCA-Morph as an ideal solution for resource-constrained medical applications, such as primary care settings and operating rooms.</description>

      <title>Active Event Alignment for Monocular Distance Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras provide a natural and data efficient representation of visual information, motivating novel computational strategies towards extracting visual information. Inspired by the biological vision system, we propose a behavior driven approach for object-wise distance estimation from event camera data. This behavior-driven method mimics how biological systems, like the human eye, stabilize their view based on object distance: distant objects require minimal compensatory rotation to stay in focus, while nearby objects demand greater adjustments to maintain alignment. This adaptive strategy leverages natural stabilization behaviors to estimate relative distances effectively. Unlike traditional vision algorithms that estimate depth across the entire image, our approach targets local depth estimation within a specific region of interest. By aligning events within a small region, we estimate the angular velocity required to stabilize the image motion. We demonstrate that, under certain assumptions, the compensatory rotational flow is inversely proportional to the object's distance. The proposed approach achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy in distance estimation - a performance gain of 16% on EVIMO2. EVIMO2 event sequences comprise complex camera motion and substantial variance in depth of static real world scenes.</description>

      <title>Motion Graph Unleashed: A Novel Approach to Video Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce motion graph, a novel approach to the video prediction problem, which predicts future video frames from limited past data. The motion graph transforms patches of video frames into interconnected graph nodes, to comprehensively describe the spatial-temporal relationships among them. This representation overcomes the limitations of existing motion representations such as image differences, optical flow, and motion matrix that either fall short in capturing complex motion patterns or suffer from excessive memory consumption. We further present a video prediction pipeline empowered by motion graph, exhibiting substantial performance improvements and cost reductions. Experiments on various datasets, including UCF Sports, KITTI and Cityscapes, highlight the strong representative ability of motion graph. Especially on UCF Sports, our method matches and outperforms the SOTA methods with a significant reduction in model size by 78% and a substantial decrease in GPU memory utilization by 47%.</description>

      <title>Multi-Object 3D Grounding with Dynamic Modules and Language-Informed Spatial Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-object 3D Grounding involves locating 3D boxes based on a given query phrase from a point cloud. It is a challenging and significant task with numerous applications in visual understanding, human-computer interaction, and robotics. To tackle this challenge, we introduce D-LISA, a two-stage approach incorporating three innovations. First, a dynamic vision module that enables a variable and learnable number of box proposals. Second, a dynamic camera positioning that extracts features for each proposal. Third, a language-informed spatial attention module that better reasons over the proposals to output the final prediction. Empirically, experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on multi-object 3D grounding by 12.8% (absolute) and is competitive in single-object 3D grounding.</description>

      <title>Effective Guidance for Model Attention with Simple Yes-no Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern deep learning models often make predictions by focusing on irrelevant areas, leading to biased performance and limited generalization. Existing methods aimed at rectifying model attention require explicit labels for irrelevant areas or complex pixel-wise ground truth attention maps. We present CRAYON (Correcting Reasoning with Annotations of Yes Or No), offering effective, scalable, and practical solutions to rectify model attention using simple yes-no annotations. CRAYON empowers classical and modern model interpretation techniques to identify and guide model reasoning: CRAYON-ATTENTION directs classic interpretations based on saliency maps to focus on relevant image regions, while CRAYON-PRUNING removes irrelevant neurons identified by modern concept-based methods to mitigate their influence. Through extensive experiments with both quantitative and human evaluation, we showcase CRAYON's effectiveness, scalability, and practicality in refining model attention. CRAYON achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming 12 methods across 3 benchmark datasets, surpassing approaches that require more complex annotations.</description>

      <title>Senna: Bridging Large Vision-Language Models and End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving demonstrates strong planning capabilities with large-scale data but still struggles in complex, rare scenarios due to limited commonsense. In contrast, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in scene understanding and reasoning. The path forward lies in merging the strengths of both approaches. Previous methods using LVLMs to predict trajectories or control signals yield suboptimal results, as LVLMs are not well-suited for precise numerical predictions. This paper presents Senna, an autonomous driving system combining an LVLM (Senna-VLM) with an end-to-end model (Senna-E2E). Senna decouples high-level planning from low-level trajectory prediction. Senna-VLM generates planning decisions in natural language, while Senna-E2E predicts precise trajectories. Senna-VLM utilizes a multi-image encoding approach and multi-view prompts for efficient scene understanding. Besides, we introduce planning-oriented QAs alongside a three-stage training strategy, which enhances Senna-VLM's planning performance while preserving commonsense. Extensive experiments on two datasets show that Senna achieves state-of-the-art planning performance. Notably, with pre-training on a large-scale dataset DriveX and fine-tuning on nuScenes, Senna significantly reduces average planning error by 27.12% and collision rate by 33.33% over model without pre-training. We believe Senna's cross-scenario generalization and transferability are essential for achieving fully autonomous driving. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/hustvl/Senna.</description>

      <title>Multi-Class Textual-Inversion Secretly Yields a Semantic-Agnostic Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of large pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP, prompt learning methods aim to enhance the transferability of the CLIP model. They learn the prompt given few samples from the downstream task given the specific class names as prior knowledge, which we term as semantic-aware classification. However, in many realistic scenarios, we only have access to few samples and knowledge of the class names (e.g., when considering instances of classes). This challenging scenario represents the semantic-agnostic discriminative case. Text-to-Image (T2I) personalization methods aim to adapt T2I models to unseen concepts by learning new tokens and endowing these tokens with the capability of generating the learned concepts. These methods do not require knowledge of class names as a semantic-aware prior. Therefore, in this paper, we first explore Textual Inversion and reveal that the new concept tokens possess both generation and classification capabilities by regarding each category as a single concept. However, learning classifiers from single-concept textual inversion is limited since the learned tokens are suboptimal for the discriminative tasks. To mitigate this issue, we propose Multi-Class textual inversion, which includes a discriminative regularization term for the token updating process. Using this technique, our method MC-TI achieves stronger Semantic-Agnostic Classification while preserving the generation capability of these modifier tokens given only few samples per category. In the experiments, we extensively evaluate MC-TI on 12 datasets covering various scenarios, which demonstrates that MC-TI achieves superior results in terms of both classification and generation outcomes.</description>

      <title>Task Vectors are Cross-Modal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the internal representations of vision-and-language models (VLMs) and how they encode task representations. We consider tasks specified through examples or instructions, using either text or image inputs. Surprisingly, we find that conceptually similar tasks are mapped to similar task vector representations, regardless of how they are specified. Our findings suggest that to output answers, tokens in VLMs undergo three distinct phases: input, task, and answer, a process which is consistent across different modalities and specifications. The task vectors we identify in VLMs are general enough to be derived in one modality (e.g., text) and transferred to another (e.g., image). Additionally, we find that ensembling exemplar and instruction based task vectors produce better task representations. Taken together, these insights shed light on the underlying mechanisms of VLMs, particularly their ability to represent tasks in a shared manner across different modalities and task specifications.

      <title>Grounded GUI Understanding for Vision Based Spatial Intelligent Agent: Exemplified by Virtual Reality Apps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10811v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, spatial computing Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a transformative technology, offering users immersive and interactive experiences across diversified virtual environments. Users can interact with VR apps through interactable GUI elements (IGEs) on the stereoscopic three-dimensional (3D) graphical user interface (GUI). The accurate recognition of these IGEs is instrumental, serving as the foundation of many software engineering tasks, including automated testing and effective GUI search. The most recent IGE detection approaches for 2D mobile apps typically train a supervised object detection model based on a large-scale manually-labeled GUI dataset, usually with a pre-defined set of clickable GUI element categories like buttons and spinners. Such approaches can hardly be applied to IGE detection in VR apps, due to a multitude of challenges including complexities posed by open-vocabulary and heterogeneous IGE categories, intricacies of context-sensitive interactability, and the necessities of precise spatial perception and visual-semantic alignment for accurate IGE detection results. Thus, it is necessary to embark on the IGE research tailored to VR apps. In this paper, we propose the first zero-shot cOntext-sensitive inteRactable GUI ElemeNT dEtection framework for virtual Reality apps, named Orienter. By imitating human behaviors, Orienter observes and understands the semantic contexts of VR app scenes first, before performing the detection. The detection process is iterated within a feedback-directed validation and reflection loop. Specifically, Orienter contains three components, including (1) Semantic context comprehension, (2) Reflection-directed IGE candidate detection, and (3) Context-sensitive interactability classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Orienter is more effective than the state-of-the-art GUI element detection approaches.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Posterior Sampling Ability of Plug&amp;Play Diffusion Methods in Sparse-View CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plug&amp;Play (PnP) diffusion models are state-of-the-art methods in computed tomography (CT) reconstruction. Such methods usually consider applications where the sinogram contains a sufficient amount of information for the posterior distribution to be peaked, and consequently are evaluated using image-to-image metrics such as PSNR/SSIM. Instead, we are interested in reconstructing compressible flow images from sinograms having a small number of projections, which results in a posterior distribution no longer peaked or even multimodal. Thus, in this paper, we aim at evaluating the approximate posterior of PnP diffusion models and introduce two posterior evaluation criteria. We quantitatively evaluate three PnP diffusion methods on three different datasets for several numbers of projections. We surprisingly find that, for each method, the approximate posterior deviates from the true posterior when the number of projections decreases.</description>

      <title>Decoding Diffusion: A Scalable Framework for Unsupervised Analysis of Latent Space Biases and Representations Using Natural Language Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have made diffusion models powerful tools for creating high-quality images. However, their iterative denoising process makes understanding and interpreting their semantic latent spaces more challenging than other generative models, such as GANs. Recent methods have attempted to address this issue by identifying semantically meaningful directions within the latent space. However, they often need manual interpretation or are limited in the number of vectors that can be trained, restricting their scope and utility. This paper proposes a novel framework for unsupervised exploration of diffusion latent spaces. We directly leverage natural language prompts and image captions to map latent directions. This method allows for the automatic understanding of hidden features and supports a broader range of analysis without the need to train specific vectors. Our method provides a more scalable and interpretable understanding of the semantic knowledge encoded within diffusion models, facilitating comprehensive analysis of latent biases and the nuanced representations these models learn. Experimental results show that our framework can uncover hidden patterns and associations in various domains, offering new insights into the interpretability of diffusion model latent spaces.</description>

      <title>AiSciVision: A Framework for Specializing Large Multimodal Models in Scientific Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trust and interpretability are crucial for the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in scientific research, but current models often operate as black boxes offering limited transparency and justifications for their outputs. We introduce AiSciVision, a framework that specializes Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) into interactive research partners and classification models for image classification tasks in niche scientific domains. Our framework uses two key components: (1) Visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (VisRAG) and (2) domain-specific tools utilized in an agentic workflow. To classify a target image, AiSciVision first retrieves the most similar positive and negative labeled images as context for the LMM. Then the LMM agent actively selects and applies tools to manipulate and inspect the target image over multiple rounds, refining its analysis before making a final prediction. These VisRAG and tooling components are designed to mirror the processes of domain experts, as humans often compare new data to similar examples and use specialized tools to manipulate and inspect images before arriving at a conclusion. Each inference produces both a prediction and a natural language transcript detailing the reasoning and tool usage that led to the prediction. We evaluate AiSciVision on three real-world scientific image classification datasets: detecting the presence of aquaculture ponds, diseased eelgrass, and solar panels. Across these datasets, our method outperforms fully supervised models in low and full-labeled data settings. AiSciVision is actively deployed in real-world use, specifically for aquaculture research, through a dedicated web application that displays and allows the expert users to converse with the transcripts. This work represents a crucial step toward AI systems that are both interpretable and effective, advancing their use in scientific research and scientific discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a methodology that exploits large and diverse data sets to accurately estimate the ambient medium's Green's functions in strongly scattering media. Given these estimates, obtained with and without the use of neural networks, excellent imaging results are achieved, with a resolution that is better than that of a homogeneous medium. This phenomenon, also known as super-resolution, occurs because the ambient scattering medium effectively enhances the physical imaging aperture.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Effective Weight-Ensembling Mixture of Experts for Multi-Task Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) leverages a shared model to accomplish multiple tasks and facilitate knowledge transfer. Recent research on task arithmetic-based MTL demonstrates that merging the parameters of independently fine-tuned models can effectively achieve MTL. However, existing merging methods primarily seek a static optimal solution within the original model parameter space, which often results in performance degradation due to the inherent diversity among tasks and potential interferences. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a Weight-Ensembling Mixture of Experts (WEMoE) method for multi-task model merging. Specifically, we first identify critical (or sensitive) modules by analyzing parameter variations in core modules of Transformer-based models before and after finetuning. Then, our WEMoE statically merges non-critical modules while transforming critical modules into a mixture-of-experts (MoE) structure. During inference, expert modules in the MoE are dynamically merged based on input samples, enabling a more flexible and adaptive merging approach. Building on WEMoE, we further introduce an efficient-and-effective WEMoE (E-WEMoE) method, whose core mechanism involves eliminating non-essential elements in the critical modules of WEMoE and implementing shared routing across multiple MoE modules, thereby significantly reducing both the trainable parameters, the overall parameter count, and computational overhead of the merged model by WEMoE. Experimental results across various architectures and tasks demonstrate that both WEMoE and E-WEMoE outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) model merging methods in terms of MTL performance, generalization, and robustness.</description>

      <title>Gnothi Seauton: Empowering Faithful Self-Interpretability in Black-Box Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The debate between self-interpretable models and post-hoc explanations for black-box models is central to Explainable AI (XAI). Self-interpretable models, such as concept-based networks, offer insights by connecting decisions to human-understandable concepts but often struggle with performance and scalability. Conversely, post-hoc methods like Shapley values, while theoretically robust, are computationally expensive and resource-intensive. To bridge the gap between these two lines of research, we propose a novel method that combines their strengths, providing theoretically guaranteed self-interpretability for black-box models without compromising prediction accuracy. Specifically, we introduce a parameter-efficient pipeline, *AutoGnothi*, which integrates a small side network into the black-box model, allowing it to generate Shapley value explanations without changing the original network parameters. This side-tuning approach significantly reduces memory, training, and inference costs, outperforming traditional parameter-efficient methods, where full fine-tuning serves as the optimal baseline. *AutoGnothi* enables the black-box model to predict and explain its predictions with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments show that *AutoGnothi* offers accurate explanations for both vision and language tasks, delivering superior computational efficiency with comparable interpretability.</description>

      <title>A Longitudinal Analysis of Racial and Gender Bias in New York Times and Fox News Images and Articles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The manner in which different racial and gender groups are portrayed in news coverage plays a large role in shaping public opinion. As such, understanding how such groups are portrayed in news media is of notable societal value, and has thus been a significant endeavour in both the computer and social sciences. Yet, the literature still lacks a longitudinal study examining both the frequency of appearance of different racial and gender groups in online news articles, as well as the context in which such groups are discussed. To fill this gap, we propose two machine learning classifiers to detect the race and age of a given subject. Next, we compile a dataset of 123,337 images and 441,321 online news articles from New York Times (NYT) and Fox News (Fox), and examine representation through two computational approaches. Firstly, we examine the frequency and prominence of appearance of racial and gender groups in images embedded in news articles, revealing that racial and gender minorities are largely under-represented, and when they do appear, they are featured less prominently compared to majority groups. Furthermore, we find that NYT largely features more images of racial minority groups compared to Fox. Secondly, we examine both the frequency and context with which racial minority groups are presented in article text. This reveals the narrow scope in which certain racial groups are covered and the frequency with which different groups are presented as victims and/or perpetrators in a given conflict. Taken together, our analysis contributes to the literature by providing two novel open-source classifiers to detect race and age from images, and shedding light on the racial and gender biases in news articles from venues on opposite ends of the American political spectrum.</description>

      <title>CT to PET Translation: A Large-scale Dataset and Domain-Knowledge-Guided Diffusion Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Computed Tomography (CT) are essential for diagnosing, staging, and monitoring various diseases, particularly cancer. Despite their importance, the use of PET/CT systems is limited by the necessity for radioactive materials, the scarcity of PET scanners, and the high cost associated with PET imaging. In contrast, CT scanners are more widely available and significantly less expensive. In response to these challenges, our study addresses the issue of generating PET images from CT images, aiming to reduce both the medical examination cost and the associated health risks for patients. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a conditional diffusion model named CPDM, which, to our knowledge, is one of the initial attempts to employ a diffusion model for translating from CT to PET images. Second, we provide the largest CT-PET dataset to date, comprising 2,028,628 paired CT-PET images, which facilitates the training and evaluation of CT-to-PET translation models. For the CPDM model, we incorporate domain knowledge to develop two conditional maps: the Attention map and the Attenuation map. The former helps the diffusion process focus on areas of interest, while the latter improves PET data correction and ensures accurate diagnostic information. Experimental evaluations across various benchmarks demonstrate that CPDM surpasses existing methods in generating high-quality PET images in terms of multiple metrics.

      <title>Analyzing Noise Models and Advanced Filtering Algorithms for Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noise, an unwanted component in an image, can be the reason for the degradation of Image at the time of transmission or capturing. Noise reduction from images is still a challenging task. Digital Image Processing is a component of Digital signal processing. A wide variety of algorithms can be used in image processing to apply to an image or an input dataset and obtain important outcomes. In image processing research, removing noise from images before further analysis is essential. Post-noise removal of images improves clarity, enabling better interpretation and analysis across medical imaging, satellite imagery, and radar applications. While numerous algorithms exist, each comes with its own assumptions, strengths, and limitations. The paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of different filtering techniques on images with eight types of noise. It evaluates methodologies like Wiener, Median, Gaussian, Mean, Low pass, High pass, Laplacian and bilateral filtering, using the performance metric Peak signal to noise ratio. It shows us the impact of different filters on noise models by applying a variety of filters to various kinds of noise. Additionally, it also assists us in determining which filtering strategy is most appropriate for a certain noise model based on the circumstances.</description>

      <title>ActiveSplat: High-Fidelity Scene Reconstruction through Active Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose ActiveSplat, an autonomous high-fidelity reconstruction system leveraging Gaussian splatting. Taking advantage of efficient and realistic rendering, the system establishes a unified framework for online mapping, viewpoint selection, and path planning. The key to ActiveSplat is a hybrid map representation that integrates both dense information about the environment and a sparse abstraction of the workspace. Therefore, the system leverages sparse topology for efficient viewpoint sampling and path planning, while exploiting view-dependent dense prediction for viewpoint selection, facilitating efficient decision-making with promising accuracy and completeness. A hierarchical planning strategy based on the topological map is adopted to mitigate repetitive trajectories and improve local granularity given limited budgets, ensuring high-fidelity reconstruction with photorealistic view synthesis. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the efficacy of the proposed method in terms of reconstruction accuracy, data coverage, and exploration efficiency.

      <title>Are VLMs Really Blind</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Language Models excel in handling a wide range of complex tasks, including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Visual Question Answering (VQA), and advanced geometric reasoning. However, these models fail to perform well on low-level basic visual tasks which are especially easy for humans. Our goal in this work was to determine if these models are truly "blind" to geometric reasoning or if there are ways to enhance their capabilities in this area. Our work presents a novel automatic pipeline designed to extract key information from images in response to specific questions. Instead of just relying on direct VQA, we use question-derived keywords to create a caption that highlights important details in the image related to the question. This caption is then used by a language model to provide a precise answer to the question without requiring external fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>FANCL: Feature-Guided Attention Network with Curriculum Learning for Brain Metastases Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain metastases (BMs) in MR image is crucial for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients. Methods based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved high segmentation performance. However, due to the loss of critical feature information caused by convolutional and pooling operations, CNNs still face great challenges in small BMs segmentation. Besides, BMs are irregular and easily confused with healthy tissues, which makes it difficult for the model to effectively learn tumor structure during training. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel model called feature-guided attention network with curriculum learning (FANCL). Based on CNNs, FANCL utilizes the input image and its feature to establish the intrinsic connections between metastases of different sizes, which can effectively compensate for the loss of high-level feature from small tumors with the information of large tumors. Furthermore, FANCL applies the voxel-level curriculum learning strategy to help the model gradually learn the structure and details of BMs. And baseline models of varying depths are employed as curriculum-mining networks for organizing the curriculum progression. The evaluation results on the BraTS-METS 2023 dataset indicate that FANCL significantly improves the segmentation performance, confirming the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>PACA: Perspective-Aware Cross-Attention Representation for Zero-Shot Scene Rearrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scene rearrangement, like table tidying, is a challenging task in robotic manipulation due to the complexity of predicting diverse object arrangements. Web-scale trained generative models such as Stable Diffusion can aid by generating natural scenes as goals. To facilitate robot execution, object-level representations must be extracted to match the real scenes with the generated goals and to calculate object pose transformations. Current methods typically use a multi-step design that involves separate models for generation, segmentation, and feature encoding, which can lead to a low success rate due to error accumulation. Furthermore, they lack control over the viewing perspectives of the generated goals, restricting the tasks to 3-DoF settings. In this paper, we propose PACA, a zero-shot pipeline for scene rearrangement that leverages perspective-aware cross-attention representation derived from Stable Diffusion. Specifically, we develop a representation that integrates generation, segmentation, and feature encoding into a single step to produce object-level representations. Additionally, we introduce perspective control, thus enabling the matching of 6-DoF camera views and extending past approaches that were limited to 3-DoF top-down views. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated through its zero-shot performance in real robot experiments across various scenes, achieving an average matching accuracy and execution success rate of 87% and 67%, respectively.</description>

      <title>DINeuro: Distilling Knowledge from 2D Natural Images via Deformable Tubular Transferring Strategy for 3D Neuron Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing neuron morphology from 3D light microscope imaging data is critical to aid neuroscientists in analyzing brain networks and neuroanatomy. With the boost from deep learning techniques, a variety of learning-based segmentation models have been developed to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of raw neuron images as a pre-processing step in the reconstruction workflow. However, most existing models directly encode the latent representative features of volumetric neuron data but neglect their intrinsic morphological knowledge. To address this limitation, we design a novel framework that distills the prior knowledge from a 2D Vision Transformer pre-trained on extensive 2D natural images to facilitate neuronal morphological learning of our 3D Vision Transformer. To bridge the knowledge gap between the 2D natural image and 3D microscopic morphologic domains, we propose a deformable tubular transferring strategy that adapts the pre-trained 2D natural knowledge to the inherent tubular characteristics of neuronal structure in the latent embedding space. The experimental results on the Janelia dataset of the BigNeuron project demonstrate that our method achieves a segmentation performance improvement of 4.53% in mean Dice and 3.56% in mean 95% Hausdorff distance.</description>

      <title>4D-based Robot Navigation Using Relativistic Image Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine perception is an important prerequisite for safe interaction and locomotion in dynamic environments. This requires not only the timely perception of surrounding geometries and distances but also the ability to react to changing situations through predefined, learned but also reusable skill endings of a robot so that physical damage or bodily harm can be avoided. In this context, 4D perception offers the possibility of predicting one's own position and changes in the environment over time. In this paper, we present a 4D-based approach to robot navigation using relativistic image processing. Relativistic image processing handles the temporal-related sensor information in a tensor model within a constructive 4D space. 4D-based navigation expands the causal understanding and the resulting interaction radius of a robot through the use of visual and sensory 4D information.</description>

      <title>RankUp: Boosting Semi-Supervised Regression with an Auxiliary Ranking Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) semi-supervised learning techniques, such as FixMatch and it's variants, have demonstrated impressive performance in classification tasks. However, these methods are not directly applicable to regression tasks. In this paper, we present RankUp, a simple yet effective approach that adapts existing semi-supervised classification techniques to enhance the performance of regression tasks. RankUp achieves this by converting the original regression task into a ranking problem and training it concurrently with the original regression objective. This auxiliary ranking classifier outputs a classification result, thus enabling integration with existing semi-supervised classification methods. Moreover, we introduce regression distribution alignment (RDA), a complementary technique that further enhances RankUp's performance by refining pseudo-labels through distribution alignment. Despite its simplicity, RankUp, with or without RDA, achieves SOTA results in across a range of regression benchmarks, including computer vision, audio, and natural language processing tasks.

      <title>ADAM: An Embodied Causal Agent in Open-World Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In open-world environments like Minecraft, existing agents face challenges in continuously learning structured knowledge, particularly causality. These challenges stem from the opacity inherent in black-box models and an excessive reliance on prior knowledge during training, which impair their interpretability and generalization capability. To this end, we introduce ADAM, An emboDied causal Agent in Minecraft, that can autonomously navigate the open world, perceive multimodal contexts, learn causal world knowledge, and tackle complex tasks through lifelong learning. ADAM is empowered by four key components: 1) an interaction module, enabling the agent to execute actions while documenting the interaction processes; 2) a causal model module, tasked with constructing an ever-growing causal graph from scratch, which enhances interpretability and diminishes reliance on prior knowledge; 3) a controller module, comprising a planner, an actor, and a memory pool, which uses the learned causal graph to accomplish tasks; 4) a perception module, powered by multimodal large language models, which enables ADAM to perceive like a human player. Extensive experiments show that ADAM constructs an almost perfect causal graph from scratch, enabling efficient task decomposition and execution with strong interpretability. Notably, in our modified Minecraft games where no prior knowledge is available, ADAM maintains its performance and shows remarkable robustness and generalization capability. ADAM pioneers a novel paradigm that integrates causal methods and embodied agents in a synergistic manner. Our project page is at https://opencausalab.github.io/ADAM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is pivotal in healthcare, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, informing treatment strategies, and tracking disease progression. This process allows clinicians to extract critical information from visual data, enabling personalized patient care. However, developing neural networks for segmentation remains challenging, especially when preserving image resolution, which is essential in detecting subtle details that influence diagnoses. Moreover, the lack of transparency in these deep learning models has slowed their adoption in clinical practice. Efforts in model interpretability are increasingly focused on making these models' decision-making processes more transparent. In this paper, we introduce MAPUNetR, a novel architecture that synergizes the strengths of transformer models with the proven U-Net framework for medical image segmentation. Our model addresses the resolution preservation challenge and incorporates attention maps highlighting segmented regions, increasing accuracy and interpretability. Evaluated on the BraTS 2020 dataset, MAPUNetR achieved a dice score of 0.88 and a dice coefficient of 0.92 on the ISIC 2018 dataset. Our experiments show that the model maintains stable performance and potential as a powerful tool for medical image segmentation in clinical practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Endovascular surgical tool reconstruction represents an important factor in advancing endovascular tool navigation, which is an important step in endovascular surgery. However, the lack of publicly available datasets significantly restricts the development and validation of novel machine learning approaches. Moreover, due to the need for specialized equipment such as biplanar scanners, most of the previous research employs monoplanar fluoroscopic technologies, hence only capturing the data from a single view and significantly limiting the reconstruction accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce Guide3D, a bi-planar X-ray dataset for 3D reconstruction. The dataset represents a collection of high resolution bi-planar, manually annotated fluoroscopic videos, captured in real-world settings. Validating our dataset within a simulated environment reflective of clinical settings confirms its applicability for real-world applications. Furthermore, we propose a new benchmark for guidewrite shape prediction, serving as a strong baseline for future work. Guide3D not only addresses an essential need by offering a platform for advancing segmentation and 3D reconstruction techniques but also aids the development of more accurate and efficient endovascular surgery interventions.

      <description>arXiv:2410.22299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating music from images can enhance various applications, including background music for photo slideshows, social media experiences, and video creation. This paper presents an emotion-guided image-to-music generation framework that leverages the Valence-Arousal (VA) emotional space to produce music that aligns with the emotional tone of a given image. Unlike previous models that rely on contrastive learning for emotional consistency, the proposed approach directly integrates a VA loss function to enable accurate emotional alignment. The model employs a CNN-Transformer architecture, featuring pre-trained CNN image feature extractors and three Transformer encoders to capture complex, high-level emotional features from MIDI music. Three Transformer decoders refine these features to generate musically and emotionally consistent MIDI sequences. Experimental results on a newly curated emotionally paired image-MIDI dataset demonstrate the proposed model's superior performance across metrics such as Polyphony Rate, Pitch Entropy, Groove Consistency, and loss convergence.</description>

      <title>Natural Language Inference Improves Compositionality in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compositional reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remains challenging as these models often struggle to relate objects, attributes, and spatial relationships. Recent methods aim to address these limitations by relying on the semantics of the textual description, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to break them down into subsets of questions and answers. However, these methods primarily operate on the surface level, failing to incorporate deeper lexical understanding while introducing incorrect assumptions generated by the LLM. In response to these issues, we present Caption Expansion with Contradictions and Entailments (CECE), a principled approach that leverages Natural Language Inference (NLI) to generate entailments and contradictions from a given premise. CECE produces lexically diverse sentences while maintaining their core meaning. Through extensive experiments, we show that CECE enhances interpretability and reduces overreliance on biased or superficial features. By balancing CECE along the original premise, we achieve significant improvements over previous methods without requiring additional fine-tuning, producing state-of-the-art results on benchmarks that score agreement with human judgments for image-text alignment, and achieving an increase in performance on Winoground of +19.2% (group score) and +12.9% on EqBen (group score) over the best prior work (finetuned with targeted data).</description>

      <title>Robots Pre-train Robots: Manipulation-Centric Robotic Representation from Large-Scale Robot Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pre-training of visual representations has enhanced the efficiency of robot learning. Due to the lack of large-scale in-domain robotic datasets, prior works utilize in-the-wild human videos to pre-train robotic visual representation. Despite their promising results, representations from human videos are inevitably subject to distribution shifts and lack the dynamics information crucial for task completion. We first evaluate various pre-trained representations in terms of their correlation to the downstream robotic manipulation tasks (i.e., manipulation centricity). Interestingly, we find that the "manipulation centricity" is a strong indicator of success rates when applied to downstream tasks. Drawing from these findings, we propose Manipulation Centric Representation (MCR), a foundation representation learning framework capturing both visual features and the dynamics information such as actions and proprioceptions of manipulation tasks to improve manipulation centricity. Specifically, we pre-train a visual encoder on the DROID robotic dataset and leverage motion-relevant data such as robot proprioceptive states and actions. We introduce a novel contrastive loss that aligns visual observations with the robot's proprioceptive state-action dynamics, combined with a behavior cloning (BC)-like actor loss to predict actions during pre-training, along with a time contrastive loss. Empirical results across 4 simulation domains with 20 tasks verify that MCR outperforms the strongest baseline method by 14.8%. Moreover, MCR boosts the performance of data-efficient learning with a UR5e arm on 3 real-world tasks by 76.9%. Project website: https://robots-pretrain-robots.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Local Policies Enable Zero-shot Long-horizon Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sim2real for robotic manipulation is difficult due to the challenges of simulating complex contacts and generating realistic task distributions. To tackle the latter problem, we introduce ManipGen, which leverages a new class of policies for sim2real transfer: local policies. Locality enables a variety of appealing properties including invariances to absolute robot and object pose, skill ordering, and global scene configuration. We combine these policies with foundation models for vision, language and motion planning and demonstrate SOTA zero-shot performance of our method to Robosuite benchmark tasks in simulation (97%). We transfer our local policies from simulation to reality and observe they can solve unseen long-horizon manipulation tasks with up to 8 stages with significant pose, object and scene configuration variation. ManipGen outperforms SOTA approaches such as SayCan, OpenVLA, LLMTrajGen and VoxPoser across 50 real-world manipulation tasks by 36%, 76%, 62% and 60% respectively.

      <description>arXiv:2303.10944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is a visual understanding task, aiming to describe a scene as a graph of entities and their relationships with each other. Existing works rely on location labels in form of bounding boxes or segmentation masks, increasing annotation costs and limiting dataset expansion. Recognizing that many applications do not require location data, we break this dependency and introduce location-free scene graph generation (LF-SGG). This new task aims at predicting instances of entities, as well as their relationships, without the explicit calculation of their spatial localization. To objectively evaluate the task, the predicted and ground truth scene graphs need to be compared. We solve this NP-hard problem through an efficient branching algorithm. Additionally, we design the first LF-SGG method, Pix2SG, using autoregressive sequence modeling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three scene graph generation datasets as well as two downstream tasks, image retrieval and visual question answering, and show that our approach is competitive to existing methods while not relying on location cues.</description>

      <title>GPT-NAS: Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search with the Generative Pre-Trained Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as one of the effective methods to design the optimal neural network architecture automatically. Although neural architectures have achieved human-level performances in several tasks, few of them are obtained from the NAS method. The main reason is the huge search space of neural architectures, making NAS algorithms inefficient. This work presents a novel architecture search algorithm, called GPT-NAS, that optimizes neural architectures by Generative Pre-Trained (GPT) model with an evolutionary algorithm (EA) as the search strategy. In GPT-NAS, we assume that a generative model pre-trained on a large-scale corpus could learn the fundamental law of building neural architectures. Therefore, GPT-NAS leverages the GPT model to propose reasonable architecture components given the basic one and then utilizes EAs to search for the optimal solution. Such an approach can largely reduce the search space by introducing prior knowledge in the search process. Extensive experimental results show that our GPT-NAS method significantly outperforms seven manually designed neural architectures and thirteen architectures provided by competing NAS methods. In addition, our experiments also indicate that the proposed algorithm improves the performance of finely tuned neural architectures by up to about 12% compared to those without GPT, further demonstrating its effectiveness in searching neural architectures.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff Distance Matching with Adaptive Query Denoising for Rotated Detection Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07598v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detection Transformers (DETR) have recently set new benchmarks in object detection. However, their performance in detecting rotated objects lags behind established oriented object detectors. Our analysis identifies a key observation: the boundary discontinuity and square-like problem in bipartite matching poses an issue with assigning appropriate ground truths to predictions, leading to duplicate low-confidence predictions. To address this, we introduce a Hausdorff distance-based cost for bipartite matching, which more accurately quantifies the discrepancy between predictions and ground truths. Additionally, we find that a static denoising approach impedes the training of rotated DETR, especially as the quality of the detector's predictions begins to exceed that of the noised ground truths. To overcome this, we propose an adaptive query denoising method that employs bipartite matching to selectively eliminate noised queries that detract from model improvement. When compared to models adopting a ResNet-50 backbone, our proposed model yields remarkable improvements, achieving $\textbf{+4.18}$ AP$_{50}$, $\textbf{+4.59}$ AP$_{50}$, and $\textbf{+4.99}$ AP$_{50}$ on DOTA-v2.0, DOTA-v1.5, and DIOR-R, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17048v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Benchmark datasets in computer vision often contain off-topic images, near duplicates, and label errors, leading to inaccurate estimates of model performance. In this paper, we revisit the task of data cleaning and formalize it as either a ranking problem, which significantly reduces human inspection effort, or a scoring problem, which allows for automated decisions based on score distributions. We find that a specific combination of context-aware self-supervised representation learning and distance-based indicators is effective in finding issues without annotation biases. This methodology, which we call SelfClean, surpasses state-of-the-art performance in detecting off-topic images, near duplicates, and label errors within widely-used image datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, Food-101N, and STL-10, both for synthetic issues and real contamination. We apply the detailed method to multiple image benchmarks, identify up to 16% of issues, and confirm an improvement in evaluation reliability upon cleaning. The official implementation can be found at: https://github.com/Digital-Dermatology/SelfClean.</description>

      <title>GlobalDoc: A Cross-Modal Vision-Language Framework for Real-World Document Image Retrieval and Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual document understanding (VDU) has rapidly advanced with the development of powerful multi-modal language models. However, these models typically require extensive document pre-training data to learn intermediate representations and often suffer a significant performance drop in real-world online industrial settings. A primary issue is their heavy reliance on OCR engines to extract local positional information within document pages, which limits the models' ability to capture global information and hinders their generalizability, flexibility, and robustness. In this paper, we introduce GlobalDoc, a cross-modal transformer-based architecture pre-trained in a self-supervised manner using three novel pretext objective tasks. GlobalDoc improves the learning of richer semantic concepts by unifying language and visual representations, resulting in more transferable models. For proper evaluation, we also propose two novel document-level downstream VDU tasks, Few-Shot Document Image Classification (DIC) and Content-based Document Image Retrieval (DIR), designed to simulate industrial scenarios more closely. Extensive experimentation has been conducted to demonstrate GlobalDoc's effectiveness in practical settings.</description>

      <title>Aligning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Reward Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03739v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have recently emerged at the forefront of image generation, powered by very large-scale unsupervised or weakly supervised text-to-image training datasets. Due to their unsupervised training, controlling their behavior in downstream tasks, such as maximizing human-perceived image quality, image-text alignment, or ethical image generation, is difficult. Recent works finetune diffusion models to downstream reward functions using vanilla reinforcement learning, notorious for the high variance of the gradient estimators. In this paper, we propose AlignProp, a method that aligns diffusion models to downstream reward functions using end-to-end backpropagation of the reward gradient through the denoising process. While naive implementation of such backpropagation would require prohibitive memory resources for storing the partial derivatives of modern text-to-image models, AlignProp finetunes low-rank adapter weight modules and uses gradient checkpointing, to render its memory usage viable. We test AlignProp in finetuning diffusion models to various objectives, such as image-text semantic alignment, aesthetics, compressibility and controllability of the number of objects present, as well as their combinations. We show AlignProp achieves higher rewards in fewer training steps than alternatives, while being conceptually simpler, making it a straightforward choice for optimizing diffusion models for differentiable reward functions of interest. Code and Visualization results are available at https://align-prop.github.io/.</description>

      <title>From Question to Exploration: Test-Time Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05341v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt a model, initially trained on training data, to test data with potential distribution shifts. Most existing TTA methods focus on classification problems. The pronounced success of classification might lead numerous newcomers and engineers to assume that classic TTA techniques can be directly applied to the more challenging task of semantic segmentation. However, this belief is still an open question. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of existing classic TTA strategies in semantic segmentation. Our comprehensive results have led to three key observations. First, the classic normalization updating strategy only brings slight performance improvement, and in some cases, it might even adversely affect the results. Even with the application of advanced distribution estimation techniques like batch renormalization, the problem remains unresolved. Second, although the teacher-student scheme does enhance the training stability for segmentation TTA in the presence of noisy pseudo-labels and temporal correlation, it cannot directly result in performance improvement compared to the original model without TTA under complex data distribution. Third, segmentation TTA suffers a severe long-tailed class-imbalance problem, which is substantially more complex than that in TTA for classification. This long-tailed challenge negatively affects segmentation TTA performance, even when the accuracy of pseudo-labels is high. Besides those observations, we find that visual prompt tuning (VisPT) is promising in segmentation TTA and propose a novel method named TTAP. The outstanding performance of TTAP has also been verified. We hope the community can give more attention to this challenging, yet important, segmentation TTA task in the future.

      <description>arXiv:2401.06397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language foundation models, represented by Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), have gained increasing attention for jointly understanding both vision and textual tasks. However, existing approaches primarily focus on training models to match global image representations with textual descriptions, thereby overlooking the critical alignment between local regions and corresponding text tokens. This paper extends CLIP with multi-granularity alignment. Notably, we deliberately construct a new dataset comprising pseudo annotations at various levels of granularities, encompassing image-level, region-level as well as pixel-level captions and tags. Accordingly, we develop a Unified Multi-Granularity learning framework, termed UMG-CLIP, which simultaneously empowers the model with versatile perception abilities across different levels of detail. With parameter efficient tuning, UMG-CLIP surpasses current widely used CLIP variants and achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse image understanding benchmarks, including open-world recognition, retrieval, semantic segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks. We believe that UMG-CLIP represents a valuable advancement in vision-language foundation models. The code is available at https://github.com/lygsbw/UMG-CLIP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art representation learning solution, with myriads of downstream applications such as image classification, retrieval and generation. A natural question is whether these models memorize their training data, which also has implications for generalization. We propose a new method for measuring memorization in VLMs, which we call d\'ej\`a vu memorization. For VLMs trained on image-caption pairs, we show that the model indeed retains information about individual objects in the training images beyond what can be inferred from correlations or the image caption. We evaluate d\'ej\`a vu memorization at both sample and population level, and show that it is significant for OpenCLIP trained on as many as 50M image-caption pairs. Finally, we show that text randomization considerably mitigates memorization while only moderately impacting the model's downstream task performance.</description>

      <title>MamMIL: Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Images with State Space Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, pathological diagnosis has achieved superior performance by combining deep learning models with the multiple instance learning (MIL) framework using whole slide images (WSIs). However, the giga-pixeled nature of WSIs poses a great challenge for efficient MIL. Existing studies either do not consider global dependencies among instances, or use approximations such as linear attentions to model the pair-to-pair instance interactions, which inevitably brings performance bottlenecks. To tackle this challenge, we propose a framework named MamMIL for WSI analysis by cooperating the selective structured state space model (i.e., Mamba) with MIL, enabling the modeling of global instance dependencies while maintaining linear complexity. Specifically, considering the irregularity of the tissue regions in WSIs, we represent each WSI as an undirected graph. To address the problem that Mamba can only process 1D sequences, we further propose a topology-aware scanning mechanism to serialize the WSI graphs while preserving the topological relationships among the instances. Finally, in order to further perceive the topological structures among the instances and incorporate short-range feature interactions, we propose an instance aggregation block based on graph neural networks. Experiments show that MamMIL can achieve advanced performance than the state-of-the-art frameworks. The code can be accessed at https://github.com/Vison307/MamMIL.</description>

      <title>Human Pose Descriptions and Subject-Focused Attention for Improved Zero-Shot Transfer in Human-Centric Classification Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel LLM-based pipeline for creating contextual descriptions of human body poses in images using only auxiliary attributes. This approach facilitates the creation of the MPII Pose Descriptions dataset, which includes natural language annotations for 17,367 images containing people engaged in 410 distinct activities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pose descriptions in enabling zero-shot human-centric classification using CLIP. Moreover, we introduce the FocusCLIP framework, which incorporates Subject-Focused Attention (SFA) in CLIP for improved text-to-image alignment. Our models were pretrained on the MPII Pose Descriptions dataset and their zero-shot performance was evaluated on five unseen datasets covering three tasks. FocusCLIP outperformed the baseline CLIP model, achieving an average accuracy increase of 8.61\% (33.65\% compared to CLIP's 25.04\%). Notably, our approach yielded improvements of 3.98\% in activity recognition, 14.78\% in age classification, and 7.06\% in emotion recognition. These results highlight the potential of integrating detailed pose descriptions and subject-level guidance into general pretraining frameworks for enhanced performance in downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>SpikeReveal: Unlocking Temporal Sequences from Real Blurry Inputs with Spike Streams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09486v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing a sequence of sharp images from the blurry input is crucial for enhancing our insights into the captured scene and poses a significant challenge due to the limited temporal features embedded in the image. Spike cameras, sampling at rates up to 40,000 Hz, have proven effective in capturing motion features and beneficial for solving this ill-posed problem. Nonetheless, existing methods fall into the supervised learning paradigm, which suffers from notable performance degradation when applied to real-world scenarios that diverge from the synthetic training data domain. Moreover, the quality of reconstructed images is capped by the generated images based on motion analysis interpolation, which inherently differs from the actual scene, affecting the generalization ability of these methods in real high-speed scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first self-supervised framework for the task of spike-guided motion deblurring. Our approach begins with the formulation of a spike-guided deblurring model that explores the theoretical relationships among spike streams, blurry images, and their corresponding sharp sequences. We subsequently develop a self-supervised cascaded framework to alleviate the issues of spike noise and spatial-resolution mismatching encountered in the deblurring model. With knowledge distillation and re-blurring loss, we further design a lightweight deblur network to generate high-quality sequences with brightness and texture consistency with the original input. Quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on our real-world and synthetic datasets with spikes validate the superior generalization of the proposed framework.

      <title>LiFT: A Surprisingly Simple Lightweight Feature Transform for Dense ViT Descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple self-supervised method to enhance the performance of ViT features for dense downstream tasks. Our Lightweight Feature Transform (LiFT) is a straightforward and compact postprocessing network that can be applied to enhance the features of any pre-trained ViT backbone. LiFT is fast and easy to train with a self-supervised objective, and it boosts the density of ViT features for minimal extra inference cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LiFT can be applied with approaches that use additional task-specific downstream modules, as we integrate LiFT with ViTDet for COCO detection and segmentation. Despite the simplicity of LiFT, we find that it is not simply learning a more complex version of bilinear interpolation. Instead, our LiFT training protocol leads to several desirable emergent properties that benefit ViT features in dense downstream tasks. This includes greater scale invariance for features, and better object boundary maps. By simply training LiFT for a few epochs, we show improved performance on keypoint correspondence, detection, segmentation, and object discovery tasks. Overall, LiFT provides an easy way to unlock the benefits of denser feature arrays for a fraction of the computational cost.

      <title>Refining Text-to-Image Generation: Towards Accurate Training-Free Glyph-Enhanced Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past few years, Text-to-Image (T2I) generation approaches based on diffusion models have gained significant attention. However, vanilla diffusion models often suffer from spelling inaccuracies in the text displayed within the generated images. The capability to generate visual text is crucial, offering both academic interest and a wide range of practical applications. To produce accurate visual text images, state-of-the-art techniques adopt a glyph-controlled image generation approach, consisting of a text layout generator followed by an image generator that is conditioned on the generated text layout. Nevertheless, our study reveals that these models still face three primary challenges, prompting us to develop a testbed to facilitate future research. We introduce a benchmark, LenCom-Eval, specifically designed for testing models' capability in generating images with Lengthy and Complex visual text. Subsequently, we introduce a training-free framework to enhance the two-stage generation approaches. We examine the effectiveness of our approach on both LenCom-Eval and MARIO-Eval benchmarks and demonstrate notable improvements across a range of evaluation metrics, including CLIPScore, OCR precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, and edit distance scores. For instance, our proposed framework improves the backbone model, TextDiffuser, by more than 23\% and 13.5\% in terms of OCR word F1 on LenCom-Eval and MARIO-Eval, respectively. Our work makes a unique contribution to the field by focusing on generating images with long and rare text sequences, a niche previously unexplored by existing literature</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Counterfactual Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI has revolutionised visual content editing, empowering users to effortlessly modify images and videos. However, not all edits are equal. To perform realistic edits in domains such as natural image or medical imaging, modifications must respect causal relationships inherent to the data generation process. Such image editing falls into the counterfactual image generation regime. Evaluating counterfactual image generation is substantially complex: not only it lacks observable ground truths, but also requires adherence to causal constraints. Although several counterfactual image generation methods and evaluation metrics exist, a comprehensive comparison within a unified setting is lacking. We present a comparison framework to thoroughly benchmark counterfactual image generation methods. We integrate all models that have been used for the task at hand and expand them to novel datasets and causal graphs, demonstrating the superiority of Hierarchical VAEs across most datasets and metrics. Our framework is implemented in a user-friendly Python package that can be extended to incorporate additional SCMs, causal methods, generative models, and datasets for the community to build on.

      <title>OmniGS: Fast Radiance Field Reconstruction using Omnidirectional Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03202v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photorealistic reconstruction relying on 3D Gaussian Splatting has shown promising potential in various domains. However, the current 3D Gaussian Splatting system only supports radiance field reconstruction using undistorted perspective images. In this paper, we present OmniGS, a novel omnidirectional Gaussian splatting system, to take advantage of omnidirectional images for fast radiance field reconstruction. Specifically, we conduct a theoretical analysis of spherical camera model derivatives in 3D Gaussian Splatting. According to the derivatives, we then implement a new GPU-accelerated omnidirectional rasterizer that directly splats 3D Gaussians onto the equirectangular screen space for omnidirectional image rendering. We realize differentiable optimization of the omnidirectional radiance field without the requirement of cube-map rectification or tangent-plane approximation. Extensive experiments conducted in egocentric and roaming scenarios demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and high rendering speed using omnidirectional images. The code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>No "Zero-Shot" Without Exponential Data: Pretraining Concept Frequency Determines Multimodal Model Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Web-crawled pretraining datasets underlie the impressive "zero-shot" evaluation performance of multimodal models, such as CLIP for classification/retrieval and Stable-Diffusion for image generation. However, it is unclear how meaningful the notion of "zero-shot" generalization is for such multimodal models, as it is not known to what extent their pretraining datasets encompass the downstream concepts targeted for during "zero-shot" evaluation. In this work, we ask: How is the performance of multimodal models on downstream concepts influenced by the frequency of these concepts in their pretraining datasets? We comprehensively investigate this question across 34 models and five standard pretraining datasets (CC-3M, CC-12M, YFCC-15M, LAION-400M, LAION-Aesthetics), generating over 300GB of data artifacts. We consistently find that, far from exhibiting "zero-shot" generalization, multimodal models require exponentially more data to achieve linear improvements in downstream "zero-shot" performance, following a sample inefficient log-linear scaling trend. This trend persists even when controlling for sample-level similarity between pretraining and downstream datasets, and testing on purely synthetic data distributions. Furthermore, upon benchmarking models on long-tailed data sampled based on our analysis, we demonstrate that multimodal models across the board perform poorly. We contribute this long-tail test set as the "Let it Wag!" benchmark to further research in this direction. Taken together, our study reveals an exponential need for training data which implies that the key to "zero-shot" generalization capabilities under large-scale training paradigms remains to be found.</description>

      <title>Decomposition-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques are vital for semantic segmentation in geosciences, effectively utilizing remote sensing imagery across diverse domains. However, most existing UDA methods, which focus on domain alignment at the high-level feature space, struggle to simultaneously retain local spatial details and global contextual semantics. To overcome these challenges, a novel decomposition scheme is proposed to guide domain-invariant representation learning. Specifically, multiscale high/low-frequency decomposition (HLFD) modules are proposed to decompose feature maps into high- and low-frequency components across different subspaces. This decomposition is integrated into a fully global-local generative adversarial network (GLGAN) that incorporates global-local transformer blocks (GLTBs) to enhance the alignment of decomposed features. By integrating the HLFD scheme and the GLGAN, a novel decomposition-based UDA framework called De-GLGAN is developed to improve the cross-domain transferability and generalization capability of semantic segmentation models. Extensive experiments on two UDA benchmarks, namely ISPRS Potsdam and Vaihingen, and LoveDA Rural and Urban, demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach over existing state-of-the-art UDA methods.

      <title>Texture, Shape and Order Matter: A New Transformer Design for Sequential DeepFake Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential DeepFake detection is an emerging task that predicts the manipulation sequence in order. Existing methods typically formulate it as an image-to-sequence problem, employing conventional Transformer architectures. However, these methods lack dedicated design and consequently result in limited performance. As such, this paper describes a new Transformer design, called TSOM, by exploring three perspectives: Texture, Shape, and Order of Manipulations. Our method features four major improvements: \ding{182} we describe a new texture-aware branch that effectively captures subtle manipulation traces with a Diversiform Pixel Difference Attention module. \ding{183} Then we introduce a Multi-source Cross-attention module to seek deep correlations among spatial and sequential features, enabling effective modeling of complex manipulation traces. \ding{184} To further enhance the cross-attention, we describe a Shape-guided Gaussian mapping strategy, providing initial priors of the manipulation shape. \ding{185} Finally, observing that the subsequent manipulation in a sequence may influence traces left in the preceding one, we intriguingly invert the prediction order from forward to backward, leading to notable gains as expected. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms others by a large margin, highlighting the superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>Metric3Dv2: A Versatile Monocular Geometric Foundation Model for Zero-shot Metric Depth and Surface Normal Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Metric3D v2, a geometric foundation model for zero-shot metric depth and surface normal estimation from a single image, which is crucial for metric 3D recovery. While depth and normal are geometrically related and highly complimentary, they present distinct challenges. SoTA monocular depth methods achieve zero-shot generalization by learning affine-invariant depths, which cannot recover real-world metrics. Meanwhile, SoTA normal estimation methods have limited zero-shot performance due to the lack of large-scale labeled data. To tackle these issues, we propose solutions for both metric depth estimation and surface normal estimation. For metric depth estimation, we show that the key to a zero-shot single-view model lies in resolving the metric ambiguity from various camera models and large-scale data training. We propose a canonical camera space transformation module, which explicitly addresses the ambiguity problem and can be effortlessly plugged into existing monocular models. For surface normal estimation, we propose a joint depth-normal optimization module to distill diverse data knowledge from metric depth, enabling normal estimators to learn beyond normal labels. Equipped with these modules, our depth-normal models can be stably trained with over 16 million of images from thousands of camera models with different-type annotations, resulting in zero-shot generalization to in-the-wild images with unseen camera settings. Our method enables the accurate recovery of metric 3D structures on randomly collected internet images, paving the way for plausible single-image metrology.

      <title>AnoFPDM: Anomaly Segmentation with Forward Process of Diffusion Models for Brain MRI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weakly-supervised diffusion models (DMs) in anomaly segmentation, leveraging image-level labels, have attracted significant attention for their superior performance compared to unsupervised methods. It eliminates the need for pixel-level labels in training, offering a more cost-effective alternative to supervised methods. However, existing methods are not fully weakly-supervised because they heavily rely on costly pixel-level labels for hyperparameter tuning in inference. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Anomaly Segmentation with Forward Process of Diffusion Models (AnoFPDM), a fully weakly-supervised framework that operates without the need of pixel-level labels. Leveraging the unguided forward process as a reference for the guided forward process, we select hyperparameters such as the noise scale, the threshold for segmentation and the guidance strength. We aggregate anomaly maps from guided forward process, enhancing the signal strength of anomalous regions. Remarkably, our proposed method outperforms recent state-of-the-art weakly-supervised approaches, even without utilizing pixel-level labels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the longstanding adage "an image is worth a thousand words," generating accurate hyper-detailed image descriptions remains unsolved. Trained on short web-scraped image text, vision-language models often generate incomplete descriptions with visual inconsistencies. We address this via a novel data-centric approach with ImageInWords (IIW), a carefully designed human-in-the-loop framework for curating hyper-detailed image descriptions. Human evaluations on IIW data show major gains compared to recent datasets (+66%) and GPT4V (+48%) across comprehensiveness, specificity, hallucinations, and more. We also show that fine-tuning with IIW data improves these metrics by +31% against models trained with prior work, even with only 9k samples. Lastly, we evaluate IIW models with text-to-image generation and vision-language reasoning tasks. Our generated descriptions result in the highest fidelity images, and boost compositional reasoning by up to 6% on ARO, SVO-Probes, and Winoground datasets. We release the IIW Eval benchmark with human judgement labels, object and image-level annotations from our framework, and existing image caption datasets enriched via IIW-model.</description>

      <title>PhysMLE: Generalizable and Priors-Inclusive Multi-task Remote Physiological Measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has been widely applied to measure heart rate from face videos. To increase the generalizability of the algorithms, domain generalization (DG) attracted increasing attention in rPPG. However, when rPPG is extended to simultaneously measure more vital signs (e.g., respiration and blood oxygen saturation), achieving generalizability brings new challenges. Although partial features shared among different physiological signals can benefit multi-task learning, the sparse and imbalanced target label space brings the seesaw effect over task-specific feature learning. To resolve this problem, we designed an end-to-end Mixture of Low-rank Experts for multi-task remote Physiological measurement (PhysMLE), which is based on multiple low-rank experts with a novel router mechanism, thereby enabling the model to adeptly handle both specifications and correlations within tasks. Additionally, we introduced prior knowledge from physiology among tasks to overcome the imbalance of label space under real-world multi-task physiological measurement. For fair and comprehensive evaluations, this paper proposed a large-scale multi-task generalization benchmark, named Multi-Source Synsemantic Domain Generalization (MSSDG) protocol. Extensive experiments with MSSDG and intra-dataset have shown the effectiveness and efficiency of PhysMLE. In addition, a new dataset was collected and made publicly available to meet the needs of the MSSDG.</description>

      <title>DOGS: Distributed-Oriented Gaussian Splatting for Large-Scale 3D Reconstruction Via Gaussian Consensus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) show promising results on the novel view synthesis (NVS) task. With its superior rendering performance and high-fidelity rendering quality, 3DGS is excelling at its previous NeRF counterparts. The most recent 3DGS method focuses either on improving the instability of rendering efficiency or reducing the model size. On the other hand, the training efficiency of 3DGS on large-scale scenes has not gained much attention. In this work, we propose DoGaussian, a method that trains 3DGS distributedly. Our method first decomposes a scene into K blocks and then introduces the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) into the training procedure of 3DGS. During training, our DOGS maintains one global 3DGS model on the master node and K local 3DGS models on the slave nodes. The K local 3DGS models are dropped after training and we only query the global 3DGS model during inference. The training time is reduced by scene decomposition, and the training convergence and stability are guaranteed through the consensus on the shared 3D Gaussians. Our method accelerates the training of 3DGS by 6+ times when evaluated on large-scale scenes while concurrently achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/AIBluefisher/DOGS.</description>

      <title>Improving Gloss-free Sign Language Translation by Reducing Representation Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gloss-free sign language translation (SLT) aims to develop well-performing SLT systems with no requirement for the costly gloss annotations, but currently still lags behind gloss-based approaches significantly. In this paper, we identify a representation density problem that could be a bottleneck in restricting the performance of gloss-free SLT. Specifically, the representation density problem describes that the visual representations of semantically distinct sign gestures tend to be closely packed together in feature space, which makes gloss-free methods struggle with distinguishing different sign gestures and suffer from a sharp performance drop. To address the representation density problem, we introduce a simple but effective contrastive learning strategy, namely SignCL, which encourages gloss-free models to learn more discriminative feature representation in a self-supervised manner. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed SignCL can significantly reduce the representation density and improve performance across various translation frameworks. Specifically, SignCL achieves a significant improvement in BLEU score for the Sign Language Transformer and GFSLT-VLP on the CSL-Daily dataset by 39% and 46%, respectively, without any increase of model parameters. Compared to Sign2GPT, a state-of-the-art method based on large-scale pre-trained vision and language models, SignCL achieves better performance with only 35% of its parameters. Implementation and Checkpoints are available at https://github.com/JinhuiYE/SignCL.</description>

      <title>PaGoDA: Progressive Growing of a One-Step Generator from a Low-Resolution Diffusion Teacher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffusion model performs remarkable in generating high-dimensional content but is computationally intensive, especially during training. We propose Progressive Growing of Diffusion Autoencoder (PaGoDA), a novel pipeline that reduces the training costs through three stages: training diffusion on downsampled data, distilling the pretrained diffusion, and progressive super-resolution. With the proposed pipeline, PaGoDA achieves a $64\times$ reduced cost in training its diffusion model on 8x downsampled data; while at the inference, with the single-step, it performs state-of-the-art on ImageNet across all resolutions from 64x64 to 512x512, and text-to-image. PaGoDA's pipeline can be applied directly in the latent space, adding compression alongside the pre-trained autoencoder in Latent Diffusion Models (e.g., Stable Diffusion).

      <title>Dissecting Query-Key Interaction in Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-attention in vision transformers is often thought to perform perceptual grouping where tokens attend to other tokens with similar embeddings, which could correspond to semantically similar features of an object. However, attending to dissimilar tokens can be beneficial by providing contextual information. We propose to analyze the query-key interaction by the singular value decomposition of the interaction matrix (i.e. ${\textbf{W}_q}^\top\textbf{W}_k$). We find that in many ViTs, especially those with classification training objectives, early layers attend more to similar tokens, while late layers show increased attention to dissimilar tokens, providing evidence corresponding to perceptual grouping and contextualization, respectively. Many of these interactions between features represented by singular vectors are interpretable and semantic, such as attention between relevant objects, between parts of an object, or between the foreground and background. This offers a novel perspective on interpreting the attention mechanism, which contributes to understanding how transformer models utilize context and salient features when processing images.</description>

      <title>FastDrag: Manipulate Anything in One Step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drag-based image editing using generative models provides precise control over image contents, enabling users to manipulate anything in an image with a few clicks. However, prevailing methods typically adopt $n$-step iterations for latent semantic optimization to achieve drag-based image editing, which is time-consuming and limits practical applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel one-step drag-based image editing method, i.e., FastDrag, to accelerate the editing process. Central to our approach is a latent warpage function (LWF), which simulates the behavior of a stretched material to adjust the location of individual pixels within the latent space. This innovation achieves one-step latent semantic optimization and hence significantly promotes editing speeds. Meanwhile, null regions emerging after applying LWF are addressed by our proposed bilateral nearest neighbor interpolation (BNNI) strategy. This strategy interpolates these regions using similar features from neighboring areas, thus enhancing semantic integrity. Additionally, a consistency-preserving strategy is introduced to maintain the consistency between the edited and original images by adopting semantic information from the original image, saved as key and value pairs in self-attention module during diffusion inversion, to guide the diffusion sampling. Our FastDrag is validated on the DragBench dataset, demonstrating substantial improvements in processing time over existing methods, while achieving enhanced editing performance.

      <title>FreeSplat: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting Towards Free-View Synthesis of Indoor Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empowering 3D Gaussian Splatting with generalization ability is appealing. However, existing generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting methods are largely confined to narrow-range interpolation between stereo images due to their heavy backbones, thus lacking the ability to accurately localize 3D Gaussian and support free-view synthesis across wide view range. In this paper, we present a novel framework FreeSplat that is capable of reconstructing geometrically consistent 3D scenes from long sequence input towards free-view synthesis.Specifically, we firstly introduce Low-cost Cross-View Aggregation achieved by constructing adaptive cost volumes among nearby views and aggregating features using a multi-scale structure. Subsequently, we present the Pixel-wise Triplet Fusion to eliminate redundancy of 3D Gaussians in overlapping view regions and to aggregate features observed across multiple views. Additionally, we propose a simple but effective free-view training strategy that ensures robust view synthesis across broader view range regardless of the number of views. Our empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art novel view synthesis peformances in both novel view rendered color maps quality and depth maps accuracy across different numbers of input views. We also show that FreeSplat performs inference more efficiently and can effectively reduce redundant Gaussians, offering the possibility of feed-forward large scene reconstruction without depth priors.</description>

      <title>MoDGS: Dynamic Gaussian Splatting from Casually-captured Monocular Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose MoDGS, a new pipeline to render novel views of dy namic scenes from a casually captured monocular video. Previous monocular dynamic NeRF or Gaussian Splatting methods strongly rely on the rapid move ment of input cameras to construct multiview consistency but struggle to recon struct dynamic scenes on casually captured input videos whose cameras are either static or move slowly. To address this challenging task, MoDGS adopts recent single-view depth estimation methods to guide the learning of the dynamic scene. Then, a novel 3D-aware initialization method is proposed to learn a reasonable deformation field and a new robust depth loss is proposed to guide the learning of dynamic scene geometry. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MoDGS is able to render high-quality novel view images of dynamic scenes from just a casually captured monocular video, which outperforms state-of-the-art meth ods by a significant margin. The code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Task Graph Learning: Procedural Activity Representation and Online Mistake Detection from Egocentric Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Procedural activities are sequences of key-steps aimed at achieving specific goals. They are crucial to build intelligent agents able to assist users effectively. In this context, task graphs have emerged as a human-understandable representation of procedural activities, encoding a partial ordering over the key-steps. While previous works generally relied on hand-crafted procedures to extract task graphs from videos, in this paper, we propose an approach based on direct maximum likelihood optimization of edges' weights, which allows gradient-based learning of task graphs and can be naturally plugged into neural network architectures. Experiments on the CaptainCook4D dataset demonstrate the ability of our approach to predict accurate task graphs from the observation of action sequences, with an improvement of +16.7% over previous approaches. Owing to the differentiability of the proposed framework, we also introduce a feature-based approach, aiming to predict task graphs from key-step textual or video embeddings, for which we observe emerging video understanding abilities. Task graphs learned with our approach are also shown to significantly enhance online mistake detection in procedural egocentric videos, achieving notable gains of +19.8% and +7.5% on the Assembly101-O and EPIC-Tent-O datasets. Code for replicating experiments is available at https://github.com/fpv-iplab/Differentiable-Task-Graph-Learning.</description>

      <title>Binarized Diffusion Model for Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced diffusion models (DMs) perform impressively in image super-resolution (SR), but the high memory and computational costs hinder their deployment. Binarization, an ultra-compression algorithm, offers the potential for effectively accelerating DMs. Nonetheless, due to the model structure and the multi-step iterative attribute of DMs, existing binarization methods result in significant performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce a novel binarized diffusion model, BI-DiffSR, for image SR. First, for the model structure, we design a UNet architecture optimized for binarization. We propose the consistent-pixel-downsample (CP-Down) and consistent-pixel-upsample (CP-Up) to maintain dimension consistent and facilitate the full-precision information transfer. Meanwhile, we design the channel-shuffle-fusion (CS-Fusion) to enhance feature fusion in skip connection. Second, for the activation difference across timestep, we design the timestep-aware redistribution (TaR) and activation function (TaA). The TaR and TaA dynamically adjust the distribution of activations based on different timesteps, improving the flexibility and representation alability of the binarized module. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our BI-DiffSR outperforms existing binarization methods. Code is released at: https://github.com/zhengchen1999/BI-DiffSR.</description>

      <title>CAMS: Convolution and Attention-Free Mamba-based Cardiac Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based self-attention models have become the standard for medical image segmentation. This paper demonstrates that convolution and self-attention, while widely used, are not the only effective methods for segmentation. Breaking with convention, we present a Convolution and self-Attention-free Mamba-based semantic Segmentation Network named CAMS-Net. Specifically, we design Mamba-based Channel Aggregator and Spatial Aggregator, which are applied independently in each encoder-decoder stage. The Channel Aggregator extracts information across different channels, and the Spatial Aggregator learns features across different spatial locations. We also propose a Linearly Interconnected Factorized Mamba (LIFM) block to reduce the computational complexity of a Mamba block and to enhance its decision function by introducing a non-linearity between two factorized Mamba blocks. Our model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art CNN, self-attention, and Mamba-based methods on CMR and M&amp;Ms-2 Cardiac segmentation datasets, showing how this innovative, convolution, and self-attention-free method can inspire further research beyond CNN and Transformer paradigms, achieving linear complexity and reducing the number of parameters.

      <title>NaRCan: Natural Refined Canonical Image with Integration of Diffusion Prior for Video Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a video editing framework, NaRCan, which integrates a hybrid deformation field and diffusion prior to generate high-quality natural canonical images to represent the input video. Our approach utilizes homography to model global motion and employs multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to capture local residual deformations, enhancing the model's ability to handle complex video dynamics. By introducing a diffusion prior from the early stages of training, our model ensures that the generated images retain a high-quality natural appearance, making the produced canonical images suitable for various downstream tasks in video editing, a capability not achieved by current canonical-based methods. Furthermore, we incorporate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and introduce a noise and diffusion prior update scheduling technique that accelerates the training process by 14 times. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches in various video editing tasks and produces coherent and high-quality edited video sequences.

      <title>Neural Assets: 3D-Aware Multi-Object Scene Synthesis with Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of multi-object 3D pose control in image diffusion models. Instead of conditioning on a sequence of text tokens, we propose to use a set of per-object representations, Neural Assets, to control the 3D pose of individual objects in a scene. Neural Assets are obtained by pooling visual representations of objects from a reference image, such as a frame in a video, and are trained to reconstruct the respective objects in a different image, e.g., a later frame in the video. Importantly, we encode object visuals from the reference image while conditioning on object poses from the target frame. This enables learning disentangled appearance and pose features. Combining visual and 3D pose representations in a sequence-of-tokens format allows us to keep the text-to-image architecture of existing models, with Neural Assets in place of text tokens. By fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model with this information, our approach enables fine-grained 3D pose and placement control of individual objects in a scene. We further demonstrate that Neural Assets can be transferred and recomposed across different scenes. Our model achieves state-of-the-art multi-object editing results on both synthetic 3D scene datasets, as well as two real-world video datasets (Objectron, Waymo Open).</description>

      <title>Rethinking the Evaluation of Out-of-Distribution Detection: A Sorites Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most existing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmarks classify samples with novel labels as the OOD data. However, some marginal OOD samples actually have close semantic contents to the in-distribution (ID) sample, which makes determining the OOD sample a Sorites Paradox. In this paper, we construct a benchmark named Incremental Shift OOD (IS-OOD) to address the issue, in which we divide the test samples into subsets with different semantic and covariate shift degrees relative to the ID dataset. The data division is achieved through a shift measuring method based on our proposed Language Aligned Image feature Decomposition (LAID). Moreover, we construct a Synthetic Incremental Shift (Syn-IS) dataset that contains high-quality generated images with more diverse covariate contents to complement the IS-OOD benchmark. We evaluate current OOD detection methods on our benchmark and find several important insights: (1) The performance of most OOD detection methods significantly improves as the semantic shift increases; (2) Some methods like GradNorm may have different OOD detection mechanisms as they rely less on semantic shifts to make decisions; (3) Excessive covariate shifts in the image are also likely to be considered as OOD for some methods. Our code and data are released in https://github.com/qqwsad5/IS-OOD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs) mostly rely on vision encoders to extract visual features followed by large language models (LLMs) for visual-language tasks. However, the vision encoders set a strong inductive bias in abstracting visual representation, e.g., resolution, aspect ratio, and semantic priors, which could impede the flexibility and efficiency of the VLMs. Training pure VLMs that accept the seamless vision and language inputs, i.e., without vision encoders, remains challenging and rarely explored. Empirical observations reveal that direct training without encoders results in slow convergence and large performance gaps. In this work, we bridge the gap between encoder-based and encoder-free models, and present a simple yet effective training recipe towards pure VLMs. Specifically, we unveil the key aspects of training encoder-free VLMs efficiently via thorough experiments: (1) Bridging vision-language representation inside one unified decoder; (2) Enhancing visual recognition capability via extra supervision. With these strategies, we launch EVE, an encoder-free vision-language model that can be trained and forwarded efficiently. Notably, solely utilizing 35M publicly accessible data, EVE can impressively rival the encoder-based VLMs of similar capacities across multiple vision-language benchmarks. It significantly outperforms the counterpart Fuyu-8B with mysterious training procedures and undisclosed training data. We believe that EVE provides a transparent and efficient route for developing a pure decoder-only architecture across modalities. Our code and models are publicly available at: https://github.com/baaivision/EVE.</description>

      <title>MMDU: A Multi-Turn Multi-Image Dialog Understanding Benchmark and Instruction-Tuning Dataset for LVLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating natural and meaningful responses to communicate with multi-modal human inputs is a fundamental capability of Large Vision-Language Models(LVLMs). While current open-source LVLMs demonstrate promising performance in simplified scenarios such as single-turn single-image input, they fall short in real-world conversation scenarios such as following instructions in a long context history with multi-turn and multi-images. Existing LVLM benchmarks primarily focus on single-choice questions or short-form responses, which do not adequately assess the capabilities of LVLMs in real-world human-AI interaction applications. Therefore, we introduce MMDU, a comprehensive benchmark, and MMDU-45k, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset, designed to evaluate and improve LVLMs' abilities in multi-turn and multi-image conversations. We employ the clustering algorithm to ffnd the relevant images and textual descriptions from the open-source Wikipedia and construct the question-answer pairs by human annotators with the assistance of the GPT-4o model. MMDU has a maximum of 18k image+text tokens, 20 images, and 27 turns, which is at least 5x longer than previous benchmarks and poses challenges to current LVLMs. Our in-depth analysis of 15 representative LVLMs using MMDU reveals that open-source LVLMs lag behind closed-source counterparts due to limited conversational instruction tuning data. We demonstrate that ffne-tuning open-source LVLMs on MMDU-45k signiffcantly address this gap, generating longer and more accurate conversations, and improving scores on MMDU and existing benchmarks (MMStar: +1.1%, MathVista: +1.5%, ChartQA:+1.2%). Our contributions pave the way for bridging the gap between current LVLM models and real-world application demands. This project is available at https://github.com/Liuziyu77/MMDU.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this report, we present our champion solution for Ego4D EgoSchema Challenge in CVPR 2024. To deeply integrate the powerful egocentric captioning model and question reasoning model, we propose a novel Hierarchical Comprehension scheme for egocentric video Question Answering, named HCQA. It consists of three stages: Fine-grained Caption Generation, Context-driven Summarization, and Inference-guided Answering. Given a long-form video, HCQA captures local detailed visual information and global summarised visual information via Fine-grained Caption Generation and Context-driven Summarization, respectively. Then in Inference-guided Answering, HCQA utilizes this hierarchical information to reason and answer given question. On the EgoSchema blind test set, HCQA achieves 75% accuracy in answering over 5,000 human curated multiple-choice questions. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Hyu-Zhang/HCQA.</description>

      <title>MotionBooth: Motion-Aware Customized Text-to-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present MotionBooth, an innovative framework designed for animating customized subjects with precise control over both object and camera movements. By leveraging a few images of a specific object, we efficiently fine-tune a text-to-video model to capture the object's shape and attributes accurately. Our approach presents subject region loss and video preservation loss to enhance the subject's learning performance, along with a subject token cross-attention loss to integrate the customized subject with motion control signals. Additionally, we propose training-free techniques for managing subject and camera motions during inference. In particular, we utilize cross-attention map manipulation to govern subject motion and introduce a novel latent shift module for camera movement control as well. MotionBooth excels in preserving the appearance of subjects while simultaneously controlling the motions in generated videos. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. Our project page is at https://jianzongwu.github.io/projects/motionbooth</description>

      <title>M$^2$IST: Multi-Modal Interactive Side-Tuning for Efficient Referring Expression Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Referring expression comprehension (REC) is a vision-language task to locate a target object in an image based on a language expression. Fully fine-tuning general-purpose pre-trained vision-language foundation models for REC yields impressive performance but becomes increasingly costly. Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) methods have shown strong performance with fewer tunable parameters. However, directly applying PETL to REC faces two challenges: (1) insufficient multi-modal interaction between pre-trained vision-language foundation models, and (2) high GPU memory usage due to gradients passing through the heavy vision-language foundation models. To this end, we present M$^2$IST: Multi-Modal Interactive Side-Tuning with M$^3$ISAs: Mixture of Multi-Modal Interactive Side-Adapters. During fine-tuning, we keep the pre-trained uni-modal encoders fixed, updating M$^3$ISAs on side networks to progressively connect them, enabling more comprehensive vision-language alignment and efficient tuning for REC. Empirical results reveal that M$^2$IST achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency compared to most full fine-tuning and other PETL methods. With M$^2$IST, standard transformer-based REC methods present competitive or even superior performance compared to full fine-tuning, while utilizing only 2.11\% of the tunable parameters, 39.61\% of the GPU memory, and 63.46\% of the fine-tuning time required for full fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Visual Robustness Benchmark for Visual Question Answering (VQA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03386v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems perform just as well when deployed in the real world? Or are they susceptible to realistic corruption effects e.g. image blur, which can be detrimental in sensitive applications, such as medical VQA? While linguistic or textual robustness has been thoroughly explored in the VQA literature, there has yet to be any significant work on the visual robustness of VQA models. We propose the first large-scale benchmark comprising 213,000 augmented images, challenging the visual robustness of multiple VQA models and assessing the strength of realistic visual corruptions. Additionally, we have designed several robustness evaluation metrics that can be aggregated into a unified metric and tailored to fit a variety of use cases. Our experiments reveal several insights into the relationships between model size, performance, and robustness with the visual corruptions. Our benchmark highlights the need for a balanced approach in model development that considers model performance without compromising the robustness.</description>

      <title>GSD: View-Guided Gaussian Splatting Diffusion for 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04237v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present GSD, a diffusion model approach based on Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation for 3D object reconstruction from a single view. Prior works suffer from inconsistent 3D geometry or mediocre rendering quality due to improper representations. We take a step towards resolving these shortcomings by utilizing the recent state-of-the-art 3D explicit representation, Gaussian Splatting, and an unconditional diffusion model. This model learns to generate 3D objects represented by sets of GS ellipsoids. With these strong generative 3D priors, though learning unconditionally, the diffusion model is ready for view-guided reconstruction without further model fine-tuning. This is achieved by propagating fine-grained 2D features through the efficient yet flexible splatting function and the guided denoising sampling process. In addition, a 2D diffusion model is further employed to enhance rendering fidelity, and improve reconstructed GS quality by polishing and re-using the rendered images. The final reconstructed objects explicitly come with high-quality 3D structure and texture, and can be efficiently rendered in arbitrary views. Experiments on the challenging real-world CO3D dataset demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Project page: https://yxmu.foo/GSD/</description>

      <title>Contrastive Sequential-Diffusion Learning: Non-linear and Multi-Scene Instructional Video Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generated video scenes for action-centric sequence descriptions like recipe instructions and do-it-yourself projects include non-linear patterns, in which the next video may require to be visually consistent not on the immediate previous video but on earlier ones. Current multi-scene video synthesis approaches fail to meet these consistency requirements. To address this, we propose a contrastive sequential video diffusion method that selects the most suitable previously generated scene to guide and condition the denoising process of the next scene. The result is a multi-scene video that is grounded in the scene descriptions and coherent w.r.t the scenes that require visual consistency. Experiments with real-world action-centric data demonstrate the practicality and improved consistency of our model compared to prior work.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised pre-training with diffusion model for few-shot landmark detection in x-ray images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have been extensively applied in the medical domain for various tasks, including image classification, segmentation, and landmark detection. However, their application is often hindered by data scarcity, both in terms of available annotations and images. This study introduces a novel application of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to the landmark detection task, specifically addressing the challenge of limited annotated data in x-ray imaging. Our key innovation lies in leveraging DDPMs for self-supervised pre-training in landmark detection, a previously unexplored approach in this domain. This method enables accurate landmark detection with minimal annotated training data (as few as 50 images), surpassing both ImageNet supervised pre-training and traditional self-supervised techniques across three popular x-ray benchmark datasets. To our knowledge, this work represents the first application of diffusion models for self-supervised learning in landmark detection, which may offer a valuable pre-training approach in few-shot regimes, for mitigating data scarcity.</description>

      <title>HybridDepth: Robust Metric Depth Fusion by Leveraging Depth from Focus and Single-Image Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose HYBRIDDEPTH, a robust depth estimation pipeline that addresses key challenges in depth estimation,including scale ambiguity, hardware heterogeneity, and generalizability. HYBRIDDEPTH leverages focal stack, data conveniently accessible in common mobile devices, to produce accurate metric depth maps. By incorporating depth priors afforded by recent advances in singleimage depth estimation, our model achieves a higher level of structural detail compared to existing methods. We test our pipeline as an end-to-end system, with a newly developed mobile client to capture focal stacks, which are then sent to a GPU-powered server for depth estimation.
  Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that HYBRIDDEPTH outperforms state-of-the-art(SOTA) models on common datasets such as DDFF12 and NYU Depth V2. HYBRIDDEPTH also shows strong zero-shot generalization. When trained on NYU Depth V2, HYBRIDDEPTH surpasses SOTA models in zero-shot performance on ARKitScenes and delivers more structurally accurate depth maps on Mobile Depth.</description>

      <title>HDRGS: High Dynamic Range Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed substantial advancements in the field of 3D reconstruction from 2D images, particularly following the introduction of the neural radiance field (NeRF) technique. However, reconstructing a 3D high dynamic range (HDR) radiance field, which aligns more closely with real-world conditions, from 2D multi-exposure low dynamic range (LDR) images continues to pose significant challenges. Approaches to this issue fall into two categories: grid-based and implicit-based. Implicit methods, using multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), face inefficiencies, limited solvability, and overfitting risks. Conversely, grid-based methods require significant memory and struggle with image quality and long training times. In this paper, we introduce Gaussian Splatting-a recent, high-quality, real-time 3D reconstruction technique-into this domain. We further develop the High Dynamic Range Gaussian Splatting (HDR-GS) method, designed to address the aforementioned challenges. This method enhances color dimensionality by including luminance and uses an asymmetric grid for tone-mapping, swiftly and precisely converting pixel irradiance to color. Our approach improves HDR scene recovery accuracy and integrates a novel coarse-to-fine strategy to speed up model convergence, enhancing robustness against sparse viewpoints and exposure extremes, and preventing local optima. Extensive testing confirms that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art techniques in both synthetic and real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Image Segmentation in Foundation Model Era: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image segmentation is a long-standing challenge in computer vision, studied continuously over several decades, as evidenced by seminal algorithms such as N-Cut, FCN, and MaskFormer. With the advent of foundation models (FMs), contemporary segmentation methodologies have embarked on a new epoch by either adapting FMs (e.g., CLIP, Stable Diffusion, DINO) for image segmentation or developing dedicated segmentation foundation models (e.g., SAM). These approaches not only deliver superior segmentation performance, but also herald newfound segmentation capabilities previously unseen in deep learning context. However, current research in image segmentation lacks a detailed analysis of distinct characteristics, challenges, and solutions associated with these advancements. This survey seeks to fill this gap by providing a thorough review of cutting-edge research centered around FM-driven image segmentation. We investigate two basic lines of research -- generic image segmentation (i.e., semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation), and promptable image segmentation (i.e., interactive segmentation, referring segmentation, few-shot segmentation) -- by delineating their respective task settings, background concepts, and key challenges. Furthermore, we provide insights into the emergence of segmentation knowledge from FMs like CLIP, Stable Diffusion, and DINO. An exhaustive overview of over 300 segmentation approaches is provided to encapsulate the breadth of current research efforts. Subsequently, we engage in a discussion of open issues and potential avenues for future research. We envisage that this fresh, comprehensive, and systematic survey catalyzes the evolution of advanced image segmentation systems.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Aware Conformal Prediction for Trustworthy Hyperspectral Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification involves assigning unique labels to each pixel to identify various land cover categories. While deep classifiers have achieved high predictive accuracy in this field, they lack the ability to rigorously quantify confidence in their predictions. Quantifying the certainty of model predictions is crucial for the safe usage of predictive models, and this limitation restricts their application in critical contexts where the cost of prediction errors is significant. To support the safe deployment of HSI classifiers, we first provide a theoretical proof establishing the validity of the emerging uncertainty quantification technique, conformal prediction, in the context of HSI classification. We then propose a conformal procedure that equips any trained HSI classifier with trustworthy prediction sets, ensuring that these sets include the true labels with a user-specified probability (e.g., 95\%). Building on this foundation, we introduce Spatial-Aware Conformal Prediction (\texttt{SACP}), a conformal prediction framework specifically designed for HSI data. This method integrates essential spatial information inherent in HSIs by aggregating the non-conformity scores of pixels with high spatial correlation, which effectively enhances the efficiency of prediction sets. Both theoretical and empirical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The source code is available at \url{https://github.com/J4ckLiu/SACP}.</description>

      <title>Aligning Machine and Human Visual Representations across Abstraction Levels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved success across a wide range of applications, including as models of human behavior in vision tasks. However, neural network training and human learning differ in fundamental ways, and neural networks often fail to generalize as robustly as humans do, raising questions regarding the similarity of their underlying representations. What is missing for modern learning systems to exhibit more human-like behavior? We highlight a key misalignment between vision models and humans: whereas human conceptual knowledge is hierarchically organized from fine- to coarse-scale distinctions, model representations do not accurately capture all these levels of abstraction. To address this misalignment, we first train a teacher model to imitate human judgments, then transfer human-like structure from its representations into pretrained state-of-the-art vision foundation models. These human-aligned models more accurately approximate human behavior and uncertainty across a wide range of similarity tasks, including a new dataset of human judgments spanning multiple levels of semantic abstractions. They also perform better on a diverse set of machine learning tasks, increasing generalization and out-of-distribution robustness. Thus, infusing neural networks with additional human knowledge yields a best-of-both-worlds representation that is both more consistent with human cognition and more practically useful, thus paving the way toward more robust, interpretable, and human-like artificial intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>EMOVA: Empowering Language Models to See, Hear and Speak with Vivid Emotions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GPT-4o, an omni-modal model that enables vocal conversations with diverse emotions and tones, marks a milestone for omni-modal foundation models. However, empowering Large Language Models to perceive and generate images, texts, and speeches end-to-end with publicly available data remains challenging in the open-source community. Existing vision-language models rely on external tools for the speech processing, while speech-language models still suffer from limited or even without vision-understanding abilities. To address this gap, we propose EMOVA (EMotionally Omni-present Voice Assistant), to enable Large Language Models with end-to-end speech capabilities while maintaining the leading vision-language performance. With a semantic-acoustic disentangled speech tokenizer, we notice surprisingly that omni-modal alignment can further enhance vision-language and speech abilities compared with the corresponding bi-modal aligned counterparts. Moreover, a lightweight style module is proposed for flexible speech style controls (e.g., emotions and pitches). For the first time, EMOVA achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the vision-language and speech benchmarks, and meanwhile, supporting omni-modal spoken dialogue with vivid emotions.</description>

      <title>Multi-hypotheses Conditioned Point Cloud Diffusion for 3D Human Reconstruction from Occluded Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D human shape reconstruction under severe occlusion due to human-object or human-human interaction is a challenging problem. Parametric models i.e., SMPL(-X), which are based on the statistics across human shapes, can represent whole human body shapes but are limited to minimally-clothed human shapes. Implicit-function-based methods extract features from the parametric models to employ prior knowledge of human bodies and can capture geometric details such as clothing and hair. However, they often struggle to handle misaligned parametric models and inpaint occluded regions given a single RGB image. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline, MHCDIFF, Multi-hypotheses Conditioned Point Cloud Diffusion, composed of point cloud diffusion conditioned on probabilistic distributions for pixel-aligned detailed 3D human reconstruction under occlusion. Compared to previous implicit-function-based methods, the point cloud diffusion model can capture the global consistent features to generate the occluded regions, and the denoising process corrects the misaligned SMPL meshes. The core of MHCDIFF is extracting local features from multiple hypothesized SMPL(-X) meshes and aggregating the set of features to condition the diffusion model. In the experiments on CAPE and MultiHuman datasets, the proposed method outperforms various SOTA methods based on SMPL, implicit functions, point cloud diffusion, and their combined, under synthetic and real occlusions.

      <description>arXiv:2410.02031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reframe scene flow as the task of estimating a continuous space-time ODE that describes motion for an entire observation sequence, represented with a neural prior. Our method, EulerFlow, optimizes this neural prior estimate against several multi-observation reconstruction objectives, enabling high quality scene flow estimation via pure self-supervision on real-world data. EulerFlow works out-of-the-box without tuning across multiple domains, including large-scale autonomous driving scenes and dynamic tabletop settings. Remarkably, EulerFlow produces high quality flow estimates on small, fast moving objects like birds and tennis balls, and exhibits emergent 3D point tracking behavior by solving its estimated ODE over long-time horizons. On the Argoverse 2 2024 Scene Flow Challenge, EulerFlow outperforms all prior art, surpassing the next-best unsupervised method by more than 2.5x, and even exceeding the next-best supervised method by over 10%.</description>

Abstract: The Diffusion Model has not only garnered noteworthy achievements in the realm of image generation but has also demonstrated its potential as an effective pretraining method utilizing unlabeled data. Drawing from the extensive potential unveiled by the Diffusion Model in both semantic correspondence and open vocabulary segmentation, our work initiates an investigation into employing the Latent Diffusion Model for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation. Recently, inspired by the in-context learning ability of large language models, Few-shot Semantic Segmentation has evolved into In-context Segmentation tasks, morphing into a crucial element in assessing generalist segmentation models. In this context, we concentrate on Few-shot Semantic Segmentation, establishing a solid foundation for the future development of a Diffusion-based generalist model for segmentation. Our initial focus lies in understanding how to facilitate interaction between the query image and the support image, resulting in the proposal of a KV fusion method within the self-attention framework. Subsequently, we delve deeper into optimizing the infusion of information from the support mask and simultaneously re-evaluating how to provide reasonable supervision from the query mask. Based on our analysis, we establish a simple and effective framework named DiffewS, maximally retaining the original Latent Diffusion Model's generative framework and effectively utilizing the pre-training prior. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the previous SOTA models in multiple settings.</description>

      <title>A Unified Debiasing Approach for Vision-Language Models across Modalities and Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled complex multimodal tasks by processing text and image data simultaneously, significantly enhancing the field of artificial intelligence. However, these models often exhibit biases that can skew outputs towards societal stereotypes, thus necessitating debiasing strategies. Existing debiasing methods focus narrowly on specific modalities or tasks, and require extensive retraining. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Selective Feature Imputation for Debiasing (SFID), a novel methodology that integrates feature pruning and low confidence imputation (LCI) to effectively reduce biases in VLMs. SFID is versatile, maintaining the semantic integrity of outputs and costly effective by eliminating the need for retraining. Our experimental results demonstrate SFID's effectiveness across various VLMs tasks including zero-shot classification, text-to-image retrieval, image captioning, and text-to-image generation, by significantly reducing gender biases without compromising performance. This approach not only enhances the fairness of VLMs applications but also preserves their efficiency and utility across diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>Stratified Domain Adaptation: A Progressive Self-Training Approach for Scene Text Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has become increasingly prevalent in scene text recognition (STR), especially where training and testing data reside in different domains. The efficacy of existing UDA approaches tends to degrade when there is a large gap between the source and target domains. To deal with this problem, gradually shifting or progressively learning to shift from domain to domain is the key issue. In this paper, we introduce the Stratified Domain Adaptation (StrDA) approach, which examines the gradual escalation of the domain gap for the learning process. The objective is to partition the training data into subsets so that the progressively self-trained model can adapt to gradual changes. We stratify the training data by evaluating the proximity of each data sample to both the source and target domains. We propose a novel method for employing domain discriminators to estimate the out-of-distribution and domain discriminative levels of data samples. Extensive experiments on benchmark scene-text datasets show that our approach significantly improves the performance of baseline (source-trained) STR models.</description>

      <title>DreamClear: High-Capacity Real-World Image Restoration with Privacy-Safe Dataset Curation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image restoration (IR) in real-world scenarios presents significant challenges due to the lack of high-capacity models and comprehensive datasets. To tackle these issues, we present a dual strategy: GenIR, an innovative data curation pipeline, and DreamClear, a cutting-edge Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image restoration model. GenIR, our pioneering contribution, is a dual-prompt learning pipeline that overcomes the limitations of existing datasets, which typically comprise only a few thousand images and thus offer limited generalizability for larger models. GenIR streamlines the process into three stages: image-text pair construction, dual-prompt based fine-tuning, and data generation &amp; filtering. This approach circumvents the laborious data crawling process, ensuring copyright compliance and providing a cost-effective, privacy-safe solution for IR dataset construction. The result is a large-scale dataset of one million high-quality images. Our second contribution, DreamClear, is a DiT-based image restoration model. It utilizes the generative priors of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models and the robust perceptual capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve photorealistic restoration. To boost the model's adaptability to diverse real-world degradations, we introduce the Mixture of Adaptive Modulator (MoAM). It employs token-wise degradation priors to dynamically integrate various restoration experts, thereby expanding the range of degradations the model can address. Our exhaustive experiments confirm DreamClear's superior performance, underlining the efficacy of our dual strategy for real-world image restoration. Code and pre-trained models are available at: https://github.com/shallowdream204/DreamClear.</description>

      <title>Towards Visual Text Design Transfer Across Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual text design plays a critical role in conveying themes, emotions, and atmospheres in multimodal formats such as film posters and album covers. Translating these visual and textual elements across languages extends the concept of translation beyond mere text, requiring the adaptation of aesthetic and stylistic features. To address this, we introduce a novel task of Multimodal Style Translation (MuST-Bench), a benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of visual text generation models to perform translation across different writing systems while preserving design intent. Our initial experiments on MuST-Bench reveal that existing visual text generation models struggle with the proposed task due to the inadequacy of textual descriptions in conveying visual design. In response, we introduce SIGIL, a framework for multimodal style translation that eliminates the need for style descriptions. SIGIL enhances image generation models through three innovations: glyph latent for multilingual settings, pretrained VAEs for stable style guidance, and an OCR model with reinforcement learning feedback for optimizing readable character generation. SIGIL outperforms existing baselines by achieving superior style consistency and legibility while maintaining visual fidelity, setting itself apart from traditional description-based approaches. We release MuST-Bench publicly for broader use and exploration https://huggingface.co/datasets/yejinc/MuST-Bench.</description>

      <title>BIFR\"OST: 3D-Aware Image compositing with Language Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Bifr\"ost, a novel 3D-aware framework that is built upon diffusion models to perform instruction-based image composition. Previous methods concentrate on image compositing at the 2D level, which fall short in handling complex spatial relationships ($\textit{e.g.}$, occlusion). Bifr\"ost addresses these issues by training MLLM as a 2.5D location predictor and integrating depth maps as an extra condition during the generation process to bridge the gap between 2D and 3D, which enhances spatial comprehension and supports sophisticated spatial interactions. Our method begins by fine-tuning MLLM with a custom counterfactual dataset to predict 2.5D object locations in complex backgrounds from language instructions. Then, the image-compositing model is uniquely designed to process multiple types of input features, enabling it to perform high-fidelity image compositions that consider occlusion, depth blur, and image harmonization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that Bifr\"ost significantly outperforms existing methods, providing a robust solution for generating realistically composited images in scenarios demanding intricate spatial understanding. This work not only pushes the boundaries of generative image compositing but also reduces reliance on expensive annotated datasets by effectively utilizing existing resources in innovative ways.</description>

      <title>Paved or unpaved? A Deep Learning derived Road Surface Global Dataset from Mapillary Street-View Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have released an open dataset with global coverage on road surface characteristics (paved or unpaved) derived utilising 105 million images from the world's largest crowdsourcing-based street view platform, Mapillary, leveraging state-of-the-art geospatial AI methods. We propose a hybrid deep learning approach which combines SWIN-Transformer based road surface prediction and CLIP-and-DL segmentation based thresholding for filtering of bad quality images. The road surface prediction results have been matched and integrated with OpenStreetMap (OSM) road geometries. This study provides global data insights derived from maps and statistics about spatial distribution of Mapillary coverage and road pavedness on a continent and countries scale, with rural and urban distinction. This dataset expands the availability of global road surface information by over 3 million kilometers, now representing approximately 36% of the total length of the global road network. Most regions showed moderate to high paved road coverage (60-80%), but significant gaps were noted in specific areas of Africa and Asia. Urban areas tend to have near-complete paved coverage, while rural regions display more variability. Model validation against OSM surface data achieved strong performance, with F1 scores for paved roads between 91-97% across continents. Taking forward the work of Mapillary and their contributors and enrichment of OSM road attributes, our work provides valuable insights for applications in urban planning, disaster routing, logistics optimisation and addresses various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGS): especially SDGs 1 (No poverty), 3 (Good health and well-being), 8 (Decent work and economic growth), 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), 12 (Responsible consumption and production), and 13 (Climate action).</description>

Abstract: This paper puts forth an innovative approach that fuses deep learning, fractal analysis, and turbulence feature extraction techniques to create abstract artworks in the style of Pollock. The content and style characteristics of the image are extracted by the MindSpore deep learning framework and a pre-trained VGG19 model. An optimisation process is then employed to The method generates high-quality Pollock-style images by combining content loss, style loss and full variance loss to achieve accurate style migration. Furthermore, this paper implements a fractal dimension calculation method based on the difference box-counting method, which effectively estimates the fractal dimension of an image through edge extraction and fractal analysis. The method is based on a two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform using a Haar wavelet to decompose the image in order to extract different frequency information. This is followed by the combination of multiple features to generate unique non-homogeneous token (NFT) labels for the authentication and protection of digital artwork. The experimental results demonstrate that the generated artworks exhibit The method demonstrates significant diversity and complexity in terms of fractal dimensions and turbulence features, while the generated NFT tags ensure the uniqueness and tamperability of each digital collection. The present method organically combines computer vision, digital signal processing and blockchain technology to provide a new solution for the creation and authentication of digital artworks.</description>

      <title>BLAPose: Enhancing 3D Human Pose Estimation with Bone Length Adjustment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current approaches in 3D human pose estimation primarily focus on regressing 3D joint locations, often neglecting critical physical constraints such as bone length consistency and body symmetry. This work introduces a recurrent neural network architecture designed to capture holistic information across entire video sequences, enabling accurate prediction of bone lengths. To enhance training effectiveness, we propose a novel augmentation strategy using synthetic bone lengths that adhere to physical constraints. Moreover, we present a bone length adjustment method that preserves bone orientations while substituting bone lengths with predicted values. Our results demonstrate that existing 3D human pose estimation models can be significantly enhanced through this adjustment process. Furthermore, we fine-tune human pose estimation models using inferred bone lengths, observing notable improvements. Our bone length prediction model surpasses the previous best results, and our adjustment and fine-tuning method enhance performance across several metrics on the Human3.6M dataset.</description>

      <title>EEG-Driven 3D Object Reconstruction with Color Consistency and Diffusion Prior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: EEG-based visual perception reconstruction has become a current research hotspot. Neuroscientific studies have shown that humans can perceive various types of visual information, such as color, shape, and texture, when observing objects. However, existing technical methods often face issues such as inconsistencies in texture, shape, and color between the visual stimulus images and the reconstructed images. In this paper, we propose a method for reconstructing 3D objects with color consistency based on EEG signals. The method adopts a two-stage strategy: in the first stage, we train an implicit neural EEG encoder with the capability of perceiving 3D objects, enabling it to capture regional semantic features; in the second stage, based on the latent EEG codes obtained in the first stage, we integrate a diffusion model, neural style loss, and NeRF to implicitly decode the 3D objects. Finally, through experimental validation, we demonstrate that our method can reconstruct 3D objects with color consistency using EEG.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Learned Image Compression via Cross Window-based Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, learned image compression methods have demonstrated superior rate-distortion performance compared to traditional image compression methods. Recent methods utilize convolutional neural networks (CNN), variational autoencoders (VAE), invertible neural networks (INN), and transformers. Despite their significant contributions, a main drawback of these models is their poor performance in capturing local redundancy. Therefore, to leverage global features along with local redundancy, we propose a CNN-based solution integrated with a feature encoding module. The feature encoding module encodes important features before feeding them to the CNN and then utilizes cross-scale window-based attention, which further captures local redundancy. Cross-scale window-based attention is inspired by the attention mechanism in transformers and effectively enlarges the receptive field. Both the feature encoding module and the cross-scale window-based attention module in our architecture are flexible and can be incorporated into any other network architecture. We evaluate our method on the Kodak and CLIC datasets and demonstrate that our approach is effective and on par with state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>AutoBench-V: Can Large Vision-Language Models Benchmark Themselves?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have become essential for advancing the integration of visual and linguistic information, facilitating a wide range of complex applications and tasks. However, the evaluation of LVLMs presents significant challenges as the evaluation benchmark always demands lots of human cost for its construction, and remains static, lacking flexibility once constructed. Even though automatic evaluation has been explored in textual modality, the visual modality remains under-explored. As a result, in this work, we address a question: "Can LVLMs serve as a path to automatic benchmarking?". We introduce AutoBench-V, an automated framework for serving evaluation on demand, i.e., benchmarking LVLMs based on specific aspects of model capability. Upon receiving an evaluation capability, AutoBench-V leverages text-to-image models to generate relevant image samples and then utilizes LVLMs to orchestrate visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, completing the evaluation process efficiently and flexibly. Through an extensive evaluation of seven popular LVLMs across five demanded user inputs (i.e., evaluation capabilities), the framework shows effectiveness and reliability. We observe the following: (1) Our constructed benchmark accurately reflects varying task difficulties; (2) As task difficulty rises, the performance gap between models widens; (3) While models exhibit strong performance in abstract level understanding, they underperform in details reasoning tasks; and (4) Constructing a dataset with varying levels of difficulties is critical for a comprehensive and exhaustive evaluation. Overall, AutoBench-V not only successfully utilizes LVLMs for automated benchmarking but also reveals that LVLMs as judges have significant potential in various domains.</description>

      <title>What Makes ImageNet Look Unlike LAION</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ImageNet was famously created from Flickr image search results. What if we recreated ImageNet instead by searching the massive LAION dataset based on image captions alone? In this work, we carry out this counterfactual investigation. We find that the resulting ImageNet recreation, which we call LAIONet, looks distinctly unlike the original. Specifically, the intra-class similarity of images in the original ImageNet is dramatically higher than it is for LAIONet. Consequently, models trained on ImageNet perform significantly worse on LAIONet. We propose a rigorous explanation for the discrepancy in terms of a subtle, yet important, difference in two plausible causal data-generating processes for the respective datasets, that we support with systematic experimentation. In a nutshell, searching based on an image caption alone creates an information bottleneck that mitigates the selection bias otherwise present in image-based filtering. Our explanation formalizes a long-held intuition in the community that ImageNet images are stereotypical, unnatural, and overly simple representations of the class category. At the same time, it provides a simple and actionable takeaway for future dataset creation efforts.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Hadamard U-Net for MRI Bias Field Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic field inhomogeneity correction remains a challenging task in MRI analysis. Most established techniques are designed for brain MRI by supposing that image intensities in the identical tissue follow a uniform distribution. Such an assumption cannot be easily applied to other organs, especially those that are small in size and heterogeneous in texture (large variations in intensity), such as the prostate. To address this problem, this paper proposes a probabilistic Hadamard U-Net (PHU-Net) for prostate MRI bias field correction. First, a novel Hadamard U-Net (HU-Net) is introduced to extract the low-frequency scalar field, multiplied by the original input to obtain the prototypical corrected image. HU-Net converts the input image from the time domain into the frequency domain via Hadamard transform. In the frequency domain, high-frequency components are eliminated using the trainable filter (scaling layer), hard-thresholding layer, and sparsity penalty. Next, a conditional variational autoencoder is used to encode possible bias field-corrected variants into a low-dimensional latent space. Random samples drawn from latent space are then incorporated with a prototypical corrected image to generate multiple plausible images. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PHU-Net in correcting bias-field in prostate MRI with a fast inference speed. It has also been shown that prostate MRI segmentation accuracy improves with the high-quality corrected images from PHU-Net. The code will be available in the final version of this manuscript.</description>

Abstract: Recently, knowledge editing on large language models (LLMs) has received considerable attention. Compared to this, editing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) faces extra challenges from diverse data modalities and complicated model components, and data for LVLMs editing are limited. The existing LVLM editing benchmark, which comprises three metrics (Reliability, Locality, and Generality), falls short in the quality of synthesized evaluation images and cannot assess whether models apply edited knowledge in relevant content. Therefore, we employ more reliable data collection methods to construct a new Large $\textbf{V}$ision-$\textbf{L}$anguage Model $\textbf{K}$nowledge $\textbf{E}$diting $\textbf{B}$enchmark, $\textbf{VLKEB}$, and extend the Portability metric for more comprehensive evaluation. Leveraging a multi-modal knowledge graph, our image data are bound with knowledge entities. This can be further used to extract entity-related knowledge, which constitutes the base of editing data. We conduct experiments of different editing methods on five LVLMs, and thoroughly analyze how do they impact the models. The results reveal strengths and deficiencies of these methods and hopefully provide insights for future research. The codes and dataset are available at: https://github.com/VLKEB/VLKEB.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14623v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel theoretical simplification of the Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge (DSB) that facilitates its unification with Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), addressing the limitations of DSB in complex data generation and enabling faster convergence and enhanced performance. By employing SGMs as an initial solution for DSB, our approach capitalizes on the strengths of both frameworks, ensuring a more efficient training process and improving the performance of SGM. We also propose a reparameterization technique that, despite theoretical approximations, practically improves the network's fitting capabilities. Our extensive experimental evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the simplified DSB, demonstrating its significant improvements. We believe the contributions of this work pave the way for advanced generative modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes \textit{GO4Align}, a multi-task optimization approach that tackles task imbalance by explicitly aligning the optimization across tasks. To achieve this, we design an adaptive group risk minimization strategy, comprising two techniques in implementation: (i) dynamical group assignment, which clusters similar tasks based on task interactions; (ii) risk-guided group indicators, which exploit consistent task correlations with risk information from previous iterations. Comprehensive experimental results on diverse benchmarks demonstrate our method's performance superiority with even lower computational costs.</description>

      <title>PointCompress3D: A Point Cloud Compression Framework for Roadside LiDARs in Intelligent Transportation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), efficient data compression is crucial for managing large-scale point cloud data acquired by roadside LiDAR sensors. The demand for efficient storage, streaming, and real-time object detection capabilities for point cloud data is substantial. This work introduces PointCompress3D, a novel point cloud compression framework tailored specifically for roadside LiDARs. Our framework addresses the challenges of compressing high-resolution point clouds while maintaining accuracy and compatibility with roadside LiDAR sensors. We adapt, extend, integrate, and evaluate three cutting-edge compression methods using our real-world-based TUMTraf dataset family. We achieve a frame rate of 10 FPS while keeping compression sizes below 105 Kb, a reduction of 50 times, and maintaining object detection performance on par with the original data. In extensive experiments and ablation studies, we finally achieved a PSNR d2 of 94.46 and a BPP of 6.54 on our dataset. Future work includes the deployment on the live system. The code is available on our project website: https://pointcompress3d.github.io.</description>

      <title>SMART: Scalable Multi-agent Real-time Generation via Next-token Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven autonomous driving motion generation tasks are frequently impacted by the limitations of dataset size and the domain gap between datasets, which precludes their extensive application in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce SMART, a novel autonomous driving motion generation paradigm that models vectorized map and agent trajectory data into discrete sequence tokens. These tokens are then processed through a decoder-only transformer architecture to train for the next token prediction task across spatial-temporal series. This GPT-style method allows the model to learn the motion distribution in real driving scenarios. SMART achieves state-of-the-art performance across most of the metrics on the generative Sim Agents challenge, ranking 1st on the leaderboards of Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), demonstrating remarkable inference speed. Moreover, SMART represents the generative model in the autonomous driving motion domain, exhibiting zero-shot generalization capabilities: Using only the NuPlan dataset for training and WOMD for validation, SMART achieved a competitive score of 0.72 on the Sim Agents challenge. Lastly, we have collected over 1 billion motion tokens from multiple datasets, validating the model's scalability. These results suggest that SMART has initially emulated two important properties: scalability and zero-shot generalization, and preliminarily meets the needs of large-scale real-time simulation applications. We have released all the code to promote the exploration of models for motion generation in the autonomous driving field. The source code is available at https://github.com/rainmaker22/SMART.</description>

      <title>SeTAR: Out-of-Distribution Detection with Selective Low-Rank Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12629v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the safe deployment of neural networks. Existing CLIP-based approaches perform OOD detection by devising novel scoring functions or sophisticated fine-tuning methods. In this work, we propose SeTAR, a novel, training-free OOD detection method that leverages selective low-rank approximation of weight matrices in vision-language and vision-only models. SeTAR enhances OOD detection via post-hoc modification of the model's weight matrices using a simple greedy search algorithm. Based on SeTAR, we further propose SeTAR+FT, a fine-tuning extension optimizing model performance for OOD detection tasks. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet1K and Pascal-VOC benchmarks show SeTAR's superior performance, reducing the relatively false positive rate by up to 18.95% and 36.80% compared to zero-shot and fine-tuning baselines. Ablation studies further validate SeTAR's effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability across different model backbones. Our work offers a scalable, efficient solution for OOD detection, setting a new state-of-the-art in this area.</description>

      <title>Let it shine: Autofluorescence of Papanicolaou-stain improves AI-based cytological oral cancer detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Oral cancer is a global health challenge. It is treatable if detected early, but it is often fatal in late stages. There is a shift from the invasive and time-consuming tissue sampling and histological examination, toward non-invasive brush biopsies and cytological examination. Reliable computer-assisted methods are essential for cost-effective and accurate cytological analysis, but the lack of detailed cell-level annotations impairs model effectiveness. This study aims to improve AI-based oral cancer detection using multimodal imaging and deep fusion. We combine brightfield and fluorescence whole slide microscopy imaging to analyze Papanicolaou-stained liquid-based cytology slides of brush biopsies collected from both healthy and cancer patients. Due to limited cytological annotations, we utilize a weakly supervised deep learning approach using only patient-level labels. We evaluate various multimodal fusion strategies, including early, late, and three recent intermediate fusion methods. Our results show: (i) fluorescence imaging of Papanicolaou-stained samples provides substantial diagnostic information; (ii) multimodal fusion enhances classification and cancer detection accuracy over single-modality methods. Intermediate fusion is the leading method among the studied approaches. Specifically, the Co-Attention Fusion Network (CAFNet) model excels with an F1 score of 83.34% and accuracy of 91.79%, surpassing human performance on the task. Additional tests highlight the need for precise image registration to optimize multimodal analysis benefits. This study advances cytopathology by combining deep learning and multimodal imaging to enhance early, non-invasive detection of oral cancer, improving diagnostic accuracy and streamlining clinical workflows. The developed pipeline is also applicable in other cytological settings. Our codes and dataset are available online for further research.</description>

      <title>Chemical Shift Encoding based Double Bonds Quantification in Triglycerides using Deep Image Prior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01926v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fatty acid can potentially serve as biomarker for evaluating metabolic disorder and inflammation condition, and quantifying the double bonds is the key for revealing fatty acid information. This study presents an assessment of a deep learning approach utilizing Deep Image Prior (DIP) for the quantification of double bonds and methylene-interrupted double bonds of triglyceride derived from chemical-shift encoded multi-echo gradient echo images, all achieved without the necessity for network training. The methodology implemented a cost function grounded in signal constraints to continually refine the neural network's parameters on a single slice of images through iterative processes. Validation procedures encompassed both phantom experiments and in-vivo scans. The outcomes evidenced a concordance between the quantified values and the established reference standards, notably exemplified by a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96 (p = 0.0005) derived from the phantom experiments. The results in water-oil phantom also demonstrate the quantification reliability of the DIP method under the condition of having a relatively low-fat signal. Furthermore, the in-vivo assessments showcased the method's competency by showcasing consistent quantification results that closely mirrored previously published findings concerning subcutaneous fat. In summary, the study underscores the potential of Deep Image Prior in enabling the quantification of double bonds and methylene-interrupted double bonds from chemical-shift encoded multi-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, suggesting potential avenues for future research and clinical applications in the field.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Composition using Task Vectors with Learned Anisotropic Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained models produce strong generic representations that can be adapted via fine-tuning. The learned weight difference relative to the pre-trained model, known as a task vector, characterises the direction and stride of fine-tuning. The significance of task vectors is such that simple arithmetic operations on them can be used to combine diverse representations from different domains. This paper builds on these properties of task vectors and aims to answer (1) whether components of task vectors, particularly parameter blocks, exhibit similar characteristics, and (2) how such blocks can be used to enhance knowledge composition and transfer. To this end, we introduce aTLAS, an algorithm that linearly combines parameter blocks with different learned coefficients, resulting in anisotropic scaling at the task vector level. We show that such linear combinations explicitly exploit the low intrinsic dimensionality of pre-trained models, with only a few coefficients being the learnable parameters. Furthermore, composition of parameter blocks leverages the already learned representations, thereby reducing the dependency on large amounts of data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in task arithmetic, few-shot recognition and test-time adaptation, with supervised or unsupervised objectives. In particular, we show that (1) learned anisotropic scaling allows task vectors to be more disentangled, causing less interference in composition; (2) task vector composition excels with scarce or no labeled data and is less prone to domain shift, thus leading to better generalisability; (3) mixing the most informative parameter blocks across different task vectors prior to training can reduce the memory footprint and improve the flexibility of knowledge transfer. Moreover, we show the potential of aTLAS as a PEFT method, particularly with less data, and demonstrate its scalibility.</description>

      <title>Global-Local Medical SAM Adaptor Based on Full Adaption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emerging of visual language models, such as the segment anything model (SAM), have made great breakthroughs in the field of universal semantic segmentation and significantly aid the improvements of medical image segmentation, in particular with the help of Medical SAM adaptor (Med-SA). However, Med-SA still can be improved, as it fine-tunes SAM in a partial adaption manner. To resolve this problem, we present a novel global medical SAM adaptor (GMed-SA) with full adaption, which can adapt SAM globally. We further combine GMed-SA and Med-SA to propose a global-local medical SAM adaptor (GLMed-SA) to adapt SAM both globally and locally. Extensive experiments have been performed on the challenging public 2D melanoma segmentation dataset. The results show that GLMed-SA outperforms several state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods on various evaluation metrics, demonstrating the superiority of our methods.</description>

      <title>Enhancing GANs with Contrastive Learning-Based Multistage Progressive Finetuning SNN and RL-Based External Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been at the forefront of image synthesis, especially in medical fields like histopathology, where they help address challenges such as data scarcity, patient privacy, and class imbalance. However, several inherent and domain-specific issues remain. For GANs, training instability, mode collapse, and insufficient feedback from binary classification can undermine performance. These challenges are particularly pronounced with high-resolution histopathology images due to their complex feature representation and high spatial detail. In response to these challenges, this work proposes a novel framework integrating a contrastive learning-based Multistage Progressive Finetuning Siamese Neural Network (MFT-SNN) with a Reinforcement Learning-based External Optimizer (RL-EO). The MFT-SNN improves feature similarity extraction in histopathology data, while the RL-EO acts as a reward-based guide to balance GAN training, addressing mode collapse and enhancing output quality. The proposed approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art (SOTA) GAN models and demonstrates superior performance across multiple metrics.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Consistency Policy to Visual RL with Prioritized Proximal Experience Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With high-dimensional state spaces, visual reinforcement learning (RL) faces significant challenges in exploitation and exploration, resulting in low sample efficiency and training stability. As a time-efficient diffusion model, although consistency models have been validated in online state-based RL, it is still an open question whether it can be extended to visual RL. In this paper, we investigate the impact of non-stationary distribution and the actor-critic framework on consistency policy in online RL, and find that consistency policy was unstable during the training, especially in visual RL with the high-dimensional state space. To this end, we suggest sample-based entropy regularization to stabilize the policy training, and propose a consistency policy with prioritized proximal experience regularization (CP3ER) to improve sample efficiency. CP3ER achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in 21 tasks across DeepMind control suite and Meta-world. To our knowledge, CP3ER is the first method to apply diffusion/consistency models to visual RL and demonstrates the potential of consistency models in visual RL. More visualization results are available at https://jzndd.github.io/CP3ER-Page/.</description>

      <title>An Integrated Deep Learning Model for Skin Cancer Detection Using Hybrid Feature Fusion Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Skin cancer is a serious and potentially fatal disease caused by DNA damage. Early detection significantly increases survival rates, making accurate diagnosis crucial. In this groundbreaking study, we present a hybrid framework based on Deep Learning (DL) that achieves precise classification of benign and malignant skin lesions. Our approach begins with dataset preprocessing to enhance classification accuracy, followed by training two separate pre-trained DL models, InceptionV3 and DenseNet121. By fusing the results of each model using the weighted sum rule, our system achieves exceptional accuracy rates. Specifically, we achieve a 92.27% detection accuracy rate, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.22% specificity, 90.81% precision, and 91.57% F1-score, outperforming existing models and demonstrating the robustness and trustworthiness of our hybrid approach. Our study represents a significant advance in skin cancer diagnosis and provides a promising foundation for further research in the field. With the potential to save countless lives through earlier detection, our hybrid deep-learning approach is a game-changer in the fight against skin cancer.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Motion Planners with Mixture of Experts for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large real-world driving datasets have sparked significant research into various aspects of data-driven motion planners for autonomous driving. These include data augmentation, model architecture, reward design, training strategies, and planner pipelines. These planners promise better generalizations on complicated and few-shot cases than previous methods. However, experiment results show that many of these approaches produce limited generalization abilities in planning performance due to overly complex designs or training paradigms. In this paper, we review and benchmark previous methods focusing on generalizations. The experimental results indicate that as models are appropriately scaled, many design elements become redundant. We introduce StateTransformer-2 (STR2), a scalable, decoder-only motion planner that uses a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and a mixture-of-experts (MoE) causal Transformer architecture. The MoE backbone addresses modality collapse and reward balancing by expert routing during training. Extensive experiments on the NuPlan dataset show that our method generalizes better than previous approaches across different test sets and closed-loop simulations. Furthermore, we assess its scalability on billions of real-world urban driving scenarios, demonstrating consistent accuracy improvements as both data and model size grow.</description>

      <title>Efficient Neural Network Training via Subset Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In training neural networks, it is common practice to use partial gradients computed over batches, mostly very small subsets of the training set. This approach is motivated by the argument that such a partial gradient is close to the true one, with precision growing only with the square root of the batch size. A theoretical justification is with the help of stochastic approximation theory. However, the conditions for the validity of this theory are not satisfied in the usual learning rate schedules. Batch processing is also difficult to combine with efficient second-order optimization methods. This proposal is based on another hypothesis: the loss minimum of the training set can be expected to be well-approximated by the minima of its subsets. Such subset minima can be computed in a fraction of the time necessary for optimizing over the whole training set. This hypothesis has been tested with the help of the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 image classification benchmarks, optionally extended by training data augmentation. The experiments have confirmed that results equivalent to conventional training can be reached. In summary, even small subsets are representative if the overdetermination ratio for the given model parameter set sufficiently exceeds unity. The computing expense can be reduced to a tenth or less.</description>

      <title>Non-rigid Relative Placement through 3D Dense Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of "relative placement" is to predict the placement of one object in relation to another, e.g. placing a mug onto a mug rack. Through explicit object-centric geometric reasoning, recent methods for relative placement have made tremendous progress towards data-efficient learning for robot manipulation while generalizing to unseen task variations. However, they have yet to represent deformable transformations, despite the ubiquity of non-rigid bodies in real world settings. As a first step towards bridging this gap, we propose ``cross-displacement" - an extension of the principles of relative placement to geometric relationships between deformable objects - and present a novel vision-based method to learn cross-displacement through dense diffusion. To this end, we demonstrate our method's ability to generalize to unseen object instances, out-of-distribution scene configurations, and multimodal goals on multiple highly deformable tasks (both in simulation and in the real world) beyond the scope of prior works.

      <title>Integration of Communication and Computational Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Communication enables the expansion of human visual perception beyond the limitations of time and distance, while computational imaging overcomes the constraints of depth and breadth. Although impressive achievements have been witnessed with the two types of technologies, the occlusive information flow between the two domains is a bottleneck hindering their ulterior progression. Herein, we propose a novel framework that integrates communication and computational imaging (ICCI) to break through the inherent isolation between communication and computational imaging for remote perception. By jointly considering the sensing and transmitting of remote visual information, the ICCI framework performs a full-link information transfer optimization, aiming to minimize information loss from the generation of the information source to the execution of the final vision tasks. We conduct numerical analysis and experiments to demonstrate the ICCI framework by integrating communication systems and snapshot compressive imaging systems. Compared with straightforward combination schemes, which sequentially execute sensing and transmitting, the ICCI scheme shows greater robustness against channel noise and impairments while achieving higher data compression. Moreover, an 80 km 27-band hyperspectral video perception with a rate of 30 fps is experimentally achieved. This new ICCI remote perception paradigm offers a highefficiency solution for various real-time computer vision tasks.</description>

      <title>Transferable Adversarial Attacks on SAM and Its Downstream Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The utilization of large foundational models has a dilemma: while fine-tuning downstream tasks from them holds promise for making use of the well-generalized knowledge in practical applications, their open accessibility also poses threats of adverse usage. This paper, for the first time, explores the feasibility of adversarial attacking various downstream models fine-tuned from the segment anything model (SAM), by solely utilizing the information from the open-sourced SAM. In contrast to prevailing transfer-based adversarial attacks, we demonstrate the existence of adversarial dangers even without accessing the downstream task and dataset to train a similar surrogate model. To enhance the effectiveness of the adversarial attack towards models fine-tuned on unknown datasets, we propose a universal meta-initialization (UMI) algorithm to extract the intrinsic vulnerability inherent in the foundation model, which is then utilized as the prior knowledge to guide the generation of adversarial perturbations. Moreover, by formulating the gradient difference in the attacking process between the open-sourced SAM and its fine-tuned downstream models, we theoretically demonstrate that a deviation occurs in the adversarial update direction by directly maximizing the distance of encoded feature embeddings in the open-sourced SAM. Consequently, we propose a gradient robust loss that simulates the associated uncertainty with gradient-based noise augmentation to enhance the robustness of generated adversarial examples (AEs) towards this deviation, thus improving the transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed universal meta-initialized and gradient robust adversarial attack (UMI-GRAT) toward SAMs and their downstream models.

      <title>Search Wide, Focus Deep: Automated Fetal Brain Extraction with Sparse Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated fetal brain extraction from full-uterus MRI is a challenging task due to variable head sizes, orientations, complex anatomy, and prevalent artifacts. While deep-learning (DL) models trained on synthetic images have been successful in adult brain extraction, adapting these networks for fetal MRI is difficult due to the sparsity of labeled data, leading to increased false-positive predictions. To address this challenge, we propose a test-time strategy that reduces false positives in networks trained on sparse, synthetic labels. The approach uses a breadth-fine search (BFS) to identify a subvolume likely to contain the fetal brain, followed by a deep-focused sliding window (DFS) search to refine the extraction, pooling predictions to minimize false positives. We train models at different window sizes using synthetic images derived from a small number of fetal brain label maps, augmented with random geometric shapes. Each model is trained on diverse head positions and scales, including cases with partial or no brain tissue. Our framework matches state-of-the-art brain extraction methods on clinical HASTE scans of third-trimester fetuses and exceeds them by up to 5\% in terms of Dice in the second trimester as well as EPI scans across both trimesters. Our results demonstrate the utility of a sliding-window approach and combining predictions from several models trained on synthetic images, for improving brain-extraction accuracy by progressively refining regions of interest and minimizing the risk of missing brain mask slices or misidentifying other tissues as brain.</description>

      <title>Document Parsing Unveiled: Techniques, Challenges, and Prospects for Structured Information Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Document parsing is essential for converting unstructured and semi-structured documents-such as contracts, academic papers, and invoices-into structured, machine-readable data. Document parsing extract reliable structured data from unstructured inputs, providing huge convenience for numerous applications. Especially with recent achievements in Large Language Models, document parsing plays an indispensable role in both knowledge base construction and training data generation. This survey presents a comprehensive review of the current state of document parsing, covering key methodologies, from modular pipeline systems to end-to-end models driven by large vision-language models. Core components such as layout detection, content extraction (including text, tables, and mathematical expressions), and multi-modal data integration are examined in detail. Additionally, this paper discusses the challenges faced by modular document parsing systems and vision-language models in handling complex layouts, integrating multiple modules, and recognizing high-density text. It emphasizes the importance of developing larger and more diverse datasets and outlines future research directions.</description>
