      <title>Short-Context Dominance: How Much Local Context Natural Language Actually Needs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the short-context dominance hypothesis: that for most sequences, a small local prefix suffices to predict their next tokens. Using large language models as statistical oracles, we measure the minimum context length (MCL) needed to reproduce accurate full-context predictions across datasets with sequences of varying lengths. For sequences with 1-7k tokens from long-context documents, we consistently find that 75-80% require only the last 96 tokens at most. Given the dominance of short-context tokens, we then ask whether it is possible to detect challenging long-context sequences for which a short local prefix does not suffice for prediction. We introduce a practical proxy to MCL, called Distributionally Aware MCL (DaMCL), that does not require knowledge of the actual next-token and is compatible with sampling strategies beyond greedy decoding. Our experiments validate that simple thresholding of the metric defining DaMCL achieves high performance in detecting long vs. short context sequences. Finally, to counter the bias that short-context dominance induces in LLM output distributions, we develop an intuitive decoding algorithm that leverages our detector to identify and boost tokens that are long-range-relevant. Across Q&amp;A tasks and model architectures, we confirm that mitigating the bias improves performance.</description>

      <title>Adaptation of Embedding Models to Financial Filings via LLM Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advances in generative large language models (LLMs), practical application of specialized conversational AI agents remains constrained by computation costs, latency requirements, and the need for precise domain-specific relevance measures. While existing embedding models address the first two constraints, they underperform on information retrieval in specialized domains like finance. This paper introduces a scalable pipeline that trains specialized models from an unlabeled corpus using a general purpose retrieval embedding model as foundation. Our method yields an average of 27.7% improvement in MRR$\texttt{@}$5, 44.6% improvement in mean DCG$\texttt{@}$5 across 14 financial filing types measured over 21,800 query-document pairs, and improved NDCG on 3 of 4 document classes in FinanceBench. We adapt retrieval embeddings (bi-encoder) for RAG, not LLM generators, using LLM-judged relevance to distill domain knowledge into a compact retriever. There are prior works which pair synthetically generated queries with real passages to directly fine-tune the retrieval model. Our pipeline differs from these by introducing interaction between student and teacher models that interleaves retrieval-based mining of hard positive/negative examples from the unlabeled corpus with iterative retraining of the student model's weights using these examples. Each retrieval iteration uses the refined student model to mine the corpus for progressively harder training examples for the subsequent training iteration. The methodology provides a cost-effective solution to bridging the gap between general-purpose models and specialized domains without requiring labor-intensive human annotation.</description>

      <title>Segment, Embed, and Align: A Universal Recipe for Aligning Subtitles to Signing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to develop a universal approach for aligning subtitles (i.e., spoken language text with corresponding timestamps) to continuous sign language videos. Prior approaches typically rely on end-to-end training tied to a specific language or dataset, which limits their generality. In contrast, our method Segment, Embed, and Align (SEA) provides a single framework that works across multiple languages and domains. SEA leverages two pretrained models: the first to segment a video frame sequence into individual signs and the second to embed the video clip of each sign into a shared latent space with text. Alignment is subsequently performed with a lightweight dynamic programming procedure that runs efficiently on CPUs within a minute, even for hour-long episodes. SEA is flexible and can adapt to a wide range of scenarios, utilizing resources from small lexicons to large continuous corpora. Experiments on four sign language datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art alignment performance, highlighting the potential of SEA to generate high-quality parallel data for advancing sign language processing. SEA's code and models are openly available.</description>

      <title>Universal Adversarial Suffixes Using Calibrated Gumbel-Softmax Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) are often used as zero-shot or few-shot classifiers by scoring label words, but they remain fragile to adversarial prompts. Prior work typically optimizes task- or model-specific triggers, making results difficult to compare and limiting transferability. We study universal adversarial suffixes: short token sequences (4-10 tokens) that, when appended to any input, broadly reduce accuracy across tasks and models. Our approach learns the suffix in a differentiable "soft" form using Gumbel-Softmax relaxation and then discretizes it for inference. Training maximizes calibrated cross-entropy on the label region while masking gold tokens to prevent trivial leakage, with entropy regularization to avoid collapse. A single suffix trained on one model transfers effectively to others, consistently lowering both accuracy and calibrated confidence. Experiments on sentiment analysis, natural language inference, paraphrase detection, commonsense QA, and physical reasoning with Qwen2-1.5B, Phi-1.5, and TinyLlama-1.1B demonstrate consistent attack effectiveness and transfer across tasks and model families.</description>

      <title>Universal Adversarial Suffixes for Language Models Using Reinforcement Learning with Calibrated Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models are vulnerable to short adversarial suffixes that can reliably alter predictions. Previous works usually find such suffixes with gradient search or rule-based methods, but these are brittle and often tied to a single task or model. In this paper, a reinforcement learning framework is used where the suffix is treated as a policy and trained with Proximal Policy Optimization against a frozen model as a reward oracle. Rewards are shaped using calibrated cross-entropy, removing label bias and aggregating across surface forms to improve transferability. The proposed method is evaluated on five diverse NLP benchmark datasets, covering sentiment, natural language inference, paraphrase, and commonsense reasoning, using three distinct language models: Qwen2-1.5B Instruct, TinyLlama-1.1B Chat, and Phi-1.5. Results show that RL-trained suffixes consistently degrade accuracy and transfer more effectively across tasks and models than previous adversarial triggers of similar genres.</description>

      <title>ClinicalTrialsHub: Bridging Registries and Literature for Comprehensive Clinical Trial Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ClinicalTrialsHub, an interactive search-focused platform that consolidates all data from ClinicalTrials.gov and augments it by automatically extracting and structuring trial-relevant information from PubMed research articles. Our system effectively increases access to structured clinical trial data by 83.8% compared to relying on ClinicalTrials.gov alone, with potential to make access easier for patients, clinicians, researchers, and policymakers, advancing evidence-based medicine. ClinicalTrialsHub uses large language models such as GPT-5.1 and Gemini-3-Pro to enhance accessibility. The platform automatically parses full-text research articles to extract structured trial information, translates user queries into structured database searches, and provides an attributed question-answering system that generates evidence-grounded answers linked to specific source sentences. We demonstrate its utility through a user study involving clinicians, clinical researchers, and PhD students of pharmaceutical sciences and nursing, and a systematic automatic evaluation of its information extraction and question answering capabilities.</description>

      <title>Are generative AI text annotations systematically biased?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates bias in GLLM annotations by conceptually replicating manual annotations of Boukes (2024). Using various GLLMs (Llama3.1:8b, Llama3.3:70b, GPT4o, Qwen2.5:72b) in combination with five different prompts for five concepts (political content, interactivity, rationality, incivility, and ideology). We find GLLMs perform adequate in terms of F1 scores, but differ from manual annotations in terms of prevalence, yield substantively different downstream results, and display systematic bias in that they overlap more with each other than with manual annotations. Differences in F1 scores fail to account for the degree of bias.</description>

      <title>What Triggers my Model? Contrastive Explanations Inform Gender Choices by Translation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretability can be implemented as a means to understand decisions taken by (black box) models, such as machine translation (MT) or large language models (LLMs). Yet, research in this area has been limited in relation to a manifested problem in these models: gender bias. With this research, we aim to move away from simply measuring bias to exploring its origins. Working with gender-ambiguous natural source data, this study examines which context, in the form of input tokens in the source sentence, influences (or triggers) the translation model choice of a certain gender inflection in the target language. To analyse this, we use contrastive explanations and compute saliency attribution. We first address the challenge of a lacking scoring threshold and specifically examine different attribution levels of source words on the model gender decisions in the translation. We compare salient source words with human perceptions of gender and demonstrate a noticeable overlap between human perceptions and model attribution. Additionally, we provide a linguistic analysis of salient words. Our work showcases the relevance of understanding model translation decisions in terms of gender, how this compares to human decisions and that this information should be leveraged to mitigate gender bias.</description>

      <title>Soft Inductive Bias Approach via Explicit Reasoning Perspectives in Inappropriate Utterance Detection Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent incidents in certain online games and communities, where anonymity is guaranteed, show that unchecked inappropriate remarks frequently escalate into verbal abuse and even criminal behavior, raising significant social concerns. Consequently, there is a growing need for research on techniques that can detect inappropriate utterances within conversational texts to help build a safer communication environment. Although large-scale language models trained on Korean corpora and chain-of-thought reasoning have recently gained attention, research applying these approaches to inappropriate utterance detection remains limited. In this study, we propose a soft inductive bias approach that explicitly defines reasoning perspectives to guide the inference process, thereby promoting rational decision-making and preventing errors that may arise during reasoning. We fine-tune a Korean large language model using the proposed method and conduct both quantitative performance comparisons and qualitative evaluations across different training strategies. Experimental results show that the Kanana-1.5 model achieves an average accuracy of 87.0046, improving by approximately 3.89 percent over standard supervised learning. These findings indicate that the proposed method goes beyond simple knowledge imitation by large language models and enables more precise and consistent judgments through constrained reasoning perspectives, demonstrating its effectiveness for inappropriate utterance detection.</description>

      <title>Curriculum Guided Massive Multi Agent System Solving For Robust Long Horizon Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models and multi-agent systems have shown promise in decomposing complex tasks, yet they struggle with long-horizon reasoning tasks and escalating computation cost. This work introduces a hierarchical multi-agent architecture that distributes reasoning across a 64*64 grid of lightweight agents, supported by a selective oracle. A spatial curriculum progressively expands the operational region of the grid, ensuring that agents master easier central tasks before tackling harder peripheral ones. To improve reliability, the system integrates Negative Log-Likelihood as a measure of confidence, allowing the curriculum to prioritize regions where agents are both accurate and well calibrated. A Thompson Sampling curriculum manager adaptively chooses training zones based on competence and NLL-driven reward signals. We evaluate the approach on a spatially grounded Tower of Hanoi benchmark, which mirrors the long-horizon structure of many robotic manipulation and planning tasks. Results demonstrate improved stability, reduced oracle usage, and stronger long-range reasoning from distributed agent cooperation.</description>

      <title>HealthcareNLP: where are we and what is next?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This proposed tutorial focuses on Healthcare Domain Applications of NLP, what we have achieved around HealthcareNLP, and the challenges that lie ahead for the future. Existing reviews in this domain either overlook some important tasks, such as synthetic data generation for addressing privacy concerns, or explainable clinical NLP for improved integration and implementation, or fail to mention important methodologies, including retrieval augmented generation and the neural symbolic integration of LLMs and KGs. In light of this, the goal of this tutorial is to provide an introductory overview of the most important sub-areas of a patient- and resource-oriented HealthcareNLP, with three layers of hierarchy: data/resource layer: annotation guidelines, ethical approvals, governance, synthetic data; NLP-Eval layer: NLP tasks such as NER, RE, sentiment analysis, and linking/coding with categorised methods, leading to explainable HealthAI; patients layer: Patient Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE), health literacy, translation, simplification, and summarisation (also NLP tasks), and shared decision-making support. A hands-on session will be included in the tutorial for the audience to use HealthcareNLP applications. The target audience includes NLP practitioners in the healthcare application domain, NLP researchers who are interested in domain applications, healthcare researchers, and students from NLP fields. The type of tutorial is "Introductory to CL/NLP topics (HealthcareNLP)" and the audience does not need prior knowledge to attend this.

      <title>QSTN: A Modular Framework for Robust Questionnaire Inference with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce QSTN, an open-source Python framework for systematically generating responses from questionnaire-style prompts to support in-silico surveys and annotation tasks with large language models (LLMs). QSTN enables robust evaluation of questionnaire presentation, prompt perturbations, and response generation methods. Our extensive evaluation ($&gt;40 $ million survey responses) shows that question structure and response generation methods have a significant impact on the alignment of generated survey responses with human answers, and can be obtained for a fraction of the compute cost. In addition, we offer a no-code user interface that allows researchers to set up robust experiments with LLMs without coding knowledge. We hope that QSTN will support the reproducibility and reliability of LLM-based research in the future.</description>

      <title>An Agentic AI System for Multi-Framework Communication Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical communication is central to patient outcomes, yet large-scale human annotation of patient-provider conversation remains labor-intensive, inconsistent, and difficult to scale. Existing approaches based on large language models typically rely on single-task models that lack adaptability, interpretability, and reliability, especially when applied across various communication frameworks and clinical domains. In this study, we developed a Multi-framework Structured Agentic AI system for Clinical Communication (MOSAIC), built on a LangGraph-based architecture that orchestrates four core agents, including a Plan Agent for codebook selection and workflow planning, an Update Agent for maintaining up-to-date retrieval databases, a set of Annotation Agents that applies codebook-guided retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with dynamic few-shot prompting, and a Verification Agent that provides consistency checks and feedback. To evaluate performance, we compared MOSAIC outputs against gold-standard annotations created by trained human coders. We developed and evaluated MOSAIC using 26 gold standard annotated transcripts for training and 50 transcripts for testing, spanning rheumatology and OB/GYN domains. On the test set, MOSAIC achieved an overall F1 score of 0.928. Performance was highest in the Rheumatology subset (F1 = 0.962) and strongest for Patient Behavior (e.g., patients asking questions, expressing preferences, or showing assertiveness). Ablations revealed that MOSAIC outperforms baseline benchmarking.</description>

      <title>Automatic Essay Scoring and Feedback Generation in Basque Language Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the first publicly available dataset for Automatic Essay Scoring (AES) and feedback generation in Basque, targeting the CEFR C1 proficiency level. The dataset comprises 3,200 essays from HABE, each annotated by expert evaluators with criterion specific scores covering correctness, richness, coherence, cohesion, and task alignment enriched with detailed feedback and error examples. We fine-tune open-source models, including RoBERTa-EusCrawl and Latxa 8B/70B, for both scoring and explanation generation. Our experiments show that encoder models remain highly reliable for AES, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of Latxa significantly enhances performance, surpassing state-of-the-art (SoTA) closed-source systems such as GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 in scoring consistency and feedback quality. We also propose a novel evaluation methodology for assessing feedback generation, combining automatic consistency metrics with expert-based validation of extracted learner errors. Results demonstrate that the fine-tuned Latxa model produces criterion-aligned, pedagogically meaningful feedback and identifies a wider range of error types than proprietary models. This resource and benchmark establish a foundation for transparent, reproducible, and educationally grounded NLP research in low-resource languages such as Basque.</description>

      <title>Fluent Alignment with Disfluent Judges: Post-training for Lower-resource Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a post-training method for lower-resource languages that preserves fluency of language models even when aligned by disfluent reward models. Preference-optimization is now a well-researched topic, but previous work has mostly addressed models for English and Chinese. Lower-resource languages lack both datasets written by native speakers and language models capable of generating fluent synthetic data. Thus, in this work, we focus on developing a fluent preference-aligned language model without any instruction-tuning data in the target language. Our approach uses an on-policy training method, which we compare with two common approaches: supervised finetuning on machine-translated data and multilingual finetuning. We conduct a case study on Norwegian Bokm{\aa}l and evaluate fluency through native-speaker assessments. The results show that the on-policy aspect is crucial and outperforms the alternatives without relying on any hard-to-obtain data.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Evaluation of Preference Aggregation in Federated RLHF for Pluralistic Alignment of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of aligning large language models (LLMs) with diverse human preferences within federated learning (FL) environments, where standard methods often fail to adequately represent diverse viewpoints. We introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework that systematically assesses the trade-off between alignment quality and fairness when using different aggregation strategies for human preferences. In our federated setting, each group locally evaluates rollouts and produces reward signals, and the server aggregates these group-level rewards without accessing any raw data. Specifically, we evaluate standard reward aggregation techniques (min, max, and average) and introduce a novel adaptive scheme that dynamically adjusts preference weights based on a group's historical alignment performance. Our experiments on question-answering (Q/A) tasks using a PPO-based RLHF pipeline demonstrate that our adaptive approach consistently achieves superior fairness while maintaining competitive alignment scores. This work offers a robust methodology for evaluating LLM behavior across diverse populations and provides a practical solution for developing truly pluralistic and fairly aligned models.</description>

      <title>Ask, Answer, and Detect: Role-Playing LLMs for Personality Detection with Question-Conditioned Mixture-of-Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding human personality is crucial for web applications such as personalized recommendation and mental health assessment. Existing studies on personality detection predominantly adopt a "posts -&gt; user vector -&gt; labels" modeling paradigm, which encodes social media posts into user representations for predicting personality labels (e.g., MBTI labels). While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved text encoding capacities, these approaches remain constrained by limited supervision signals due to label scarcity, and under-specified semantic mappings between user language and abstract psychological constructs. We address these challenges by proposing ROME, a novel framework that explicitly injects psychological knowledge into personality detection. Inspired by standardized self-assessment tests, ROME leverages LLMs' role-play capability to simulate user responses to validated psychometric questionnaires. These generated question-level answers transform free-form user posts into interpretable, questionnaire-grounded evidence linking linguistic cues to personality labels, thereby providing rich intermediate supervision to mitigate label scarcity while offering a semantic reasoning chain that guides and simplifies the text-to-personality mapping learning. A question-conditioned Mixture-of-Experts module then jointly routes over post and question representations, learning to answer questionnaire items under explicit supervision. The predicted answers are summarized into an interpretable answer vector and fused with the user representation for final prediction within a multi-task learning framework, where question answering serves as a powerful auxiliary task for personality detection. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that ROME consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements (15.41% on Kaggle dataset).</description>

      <title>Do Depth-Grown Models Overcome the Curse of Depth? An In-Depth Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradually growing the depth of Transformers during training can not only reduce training cost but also lead to improved reasoning performance, as shown by MIDAS (Saunshi et al., 2024). Thus far, however, a mechanistic understanding of these gains has been missing. In this work, we establish a connection to recent work showing that layers in the second half of non-grown, pre-layernorm Transformers contribute much less to the final output distribution than those in the first half - also known as the Curse of Depth (Sun et al., 2025, Csord\'as et al., 2025). Using depth-wise analyses, we demonstrate that growth via gradual middle stacking yields more effective utilization of model depth, alters the residual stream structure, and facilitates the formation of permutable computational blocks. In addition, we propose a lightweight modification of MIDAS that yields further improvements in downstream reasoning benchmarks. Overall, this work highlights how the gradual growth of model depth can lead to the formation of distinct computational circuits and overcome the limited depth utilization seen in standard non-grown models.</description>

      <title>Toward Faithful Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by grounding outputs in retrieved evidence, but faithfulness failures, where generations contradict or extend beyond the provided sources, remain a critical challenge. Existing hallucination detection methods for RAG often rely either on large-scale detector training, which requires substantial annotated data, or on querying external LLM judges, which leads to high inference costs. Although some approaches attempt to leverage internal representations of LLMs for hallucination detection, their accuracy remains limited. Motivated by recent advances in mechanistic interpretability, we employ sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle internal activations, successfully identifying features that are specifically triggered during RAG hallucinations. Building on a systematic pipeline of information-based feature selection and additive feature modeling, we introduce RAGLens, a lightweight hallucination detector that accurately flags unfaithful RAG outputs using LLM internal representations. RAGLens not only achieves superior detection performance compared to existing methods, but also provides interpretable rationales for its decisions, enabling effective post-hoc mitigation of unfaithful RAG. Finally, we justify our design choices and reveal new insights into the distribution of hallucination-related signals within LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/RAGLens.</description>

      <title>ThreadWeaver: Adaptive Threading for Efficient Parallel Reasoning in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling inference-time computation has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve strong reasoning performance, but inherently sequential decoding leads to substantial latency, especially on complex tasks. Recent work on adaptive parallel reasoning aims to improve inference efficiency by decomposing the problem-solving process into concurrent reasoning threads when beneficial. However, existing methods on realistic tasks are either limited to supervised behavior cloning or exhibit significant accuracy drops compared to widely-used sequential long chain-of-thought (CoT) baselines. Moreover, many require customized inference engines, complicating deployment. We introduce ThreadWeaver, a framework for adaptive parallel reasoning that achieves accuracy on par with popular sequential reasoning models of comparable size while significantly reducing inference latency. ThreadWeaver's performance stems from three key innovations: 1) a two-stage parallel trajectory generator that produces large-scale, high-quality CoT data with parallel annotations for supervised fine-tuning; 2) a trie-based training-inference co-design that enables parallel reasoning on any off-the-shelf autoregressive inference engine without modifying position embeddings or KV caches; and 3) a parallelization-aware reinforcement learning framework that teaches the model to balance accuracy with effective parallelization. Across six challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ThreadWeaver trained atop Qwen3-8B achieves accuracy comparable to cutting-edge sequential reasoning models (71.9% on average and 79.9% on AIME24) while delivering up to 1.53x average speedup in token latency, establishing a new Pareto frontier between accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>MixLM: High-Throughput and Effective LLM Ranking via Text-Embedding Mix-Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at capturing semantic nuances and therefore show impressive relevance ranking performance in modern recommendation and search systems. However, they suffer from high computational overhead under industrial latency and throughput requirements. In particular, cross-encoder ranking systems often create long context prefill-heavy workloads, as the model has to be presented with the user, query and item information. To this end, we propose MixLM, a novel LLM-based ranking framework, which significantly improves the system throughput via reducing the input context length, while preserving the semantic strength of cross-encoder rankers. In contrast to a standard ranking system where the context is presented to the model as pure text, we propose to use mix-interaction, a mixture of text and embedding tokens to represent the input. Specifically, MixLM encodes all items in the catalog into a few embedding tokens and stores in a nearline cache. The encoded item descriptions are used during online inference, effectively reducing the item length from a few thousand text tokens to a few embedding tokens. We share insights from deploying our MixLM framework to a real-world search application at LinkedIn, including a detailed discussion of our training pipelines, as well as a thorough analysis of our online serving infrastructure optimization. Comparing with strong baselines, MixLM increased throughput by 10.0x under the same latency budget, while maintaining relevance metrics. The efficiency gains delivered by MixLM enabled full-traffic deployment of LLM-powered search, which resulted in a significant 0.47% increase in Daily Active Users (DAU) in online A/B tests.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Urban Science Research with AI Urban Scientist</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cities are complex, adaptive systems whose underlying principles remain difficult to disentangle despite unprecedented data abundance. Urban science therefore faces a fundamental challenge: converting vast, fragmented and interdisciplinary information into coherent explanations of how cities function and evolve. The emergence of AI scientists, i.e., agents capable of autonomous reasoning, hypothesis formation and data-driven experimentation, offers a new pathway toward accelerating this transformation, yet general-purpose systems fall short of the domain knowledge and methodological depth required for urban science research. Here we introduce a knowledge-driven AI Urban Scientist, built from hypotheses, peer-review signals, datasets and analytical patterns distilled from thousands of high-quality studies, and implemented as a coordinated multi-agent framework for end-to-end inquiry. The system generates structured hypotheses, retrieves and harmonizes heterogeneous datasets, conducts automated empirical analysis and simulation, and synthesizes insights in forms compatible with urban scientific reasoning. By providing reusable analytical tools and supporting community-driven extensions, the AI Urban Scientist lowers barriers to advanced urban analytics and acts not merely as an assistant but as an active collaborator in revealing the mechanisms that shape urban systems and in guiding the design of more resilient and equitable cities.</description>

      <title>Beyond Unified Models: A Service-Oriented Approach to Low Latency, Context Aware Phonemization for Real Time TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lightweight, real-time text-to-speech systems are crucial for accessibility. However, the most efficient TTS models often rely on lightweight phonemizers that struggle with context-dependent challenges. In contrast, more advanced phonemizers with a deeper linguistic understanding typically incur high computational costs, which prevents real-time performance.
  This paper examines the trade-off between phonemization quality and inference speed in G2P-aided TTS systems, introducing a practical framework to bridge this gap. We propose lightweight strategies for context-aware phonemization and a service-oriented TTS architecture that executes these modules as independent services. This design decouples heavy context-aware components from the core TTS engine, effectively breaking the latency barrier and enabling real-time use of high-quality phonemization models. Experimental results confirm that the proposed system improves pronunciation soundness and linguistic accuracy while maintaining real-time responsiveness, making it well-suited for offline and end-device TTS applications.</description>

      <title>Balanced Accuracy: The Right Metric for Evaluating LLM Judges - Explained through Youden's J statistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rigorous evaluation of large language models (LLMs) relies on comparing models by the prevalence of desirable or undesirable behaviors, such as task pass rates or policy violations. These prevalence estimates are produced by a classifier, either an LLM-as-a-judge or human annotators, making the choice of classifier central to trustworthy evaluation. Common metrics used for this choice, such as Accuracy, Precision, and F1, are sensitive to class imbalance and to arbitrary choices of positive class, and can favor judges that distort prevalence estimates. We show that Youden's $J$ statistic is theoretically aligned with choosing the best judge to compare models, and that Balanced Accuracy is an equivalent linear transformation of $J$. Through both analytical arguments and empirical examples and simulations, we demonstrate how selecting judges using Balanced Accuracy leads to better, more robust classifier selection.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Models Ace the CFA Exams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous research has reported that large language models (LLMs) demonstrate poor performance on the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exams. However, recent reasoning models have achieved strong results on graduate-level academic and professional examinations across various disciplines. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art reasoning models on a set of mock CFA exams consisting of 980 questions across three Level I exams, two Level II exams, and three Level III exams. Using the same pass/fail criteria from prior studies, we find that most models clear all three levels. The models that pass, ordered by overall performance, are Gemini 3.0 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, Claude Opus 4.1, and DeepSeek-V3.1. Specifically, Gemini 3.0 Pro achieves a record score of 97.6% on Level I. Performance is also strong on Level II, led by GPT-5 at 94.3%. On Level III, Gemini 2.5 Pro attains the highest score with 86.4% on multiple-choice questions while Gemini 3.0 Pro achieves 92.0% on constructed-response questions.</description>

Abstract: Workplace toxicity is widely recognized as detrimental to organizational culture, yet quantifying its direct impact on operational efficiency remains methodologically challenging due to the ethical and practical difficulties of reproducing conflict in human subjects. This study leverages Large Language Model (LLM) based Multi-Agent Systems to simulate 1-on-1 adversarial debates, creating a controlled "sociological sandbox". We employ a Monte Carlo method to simulate hundrets of discussions, measuring the convergence time (defined as the number of arguments required to reach a conclusion) between a baseline control group and treatment groups involving agents with "toxic" system prompts. Our results demonstrate a statistically significant increase of approximately 25\% in the duration of conversations involving toxic participants. We propose that this "latency of toxicity" serves as a proxy for financial damage in corporate and academic settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate that agent-based modeling provides a reproducible, ethical alternative to human-subject research for measuring the mechanics of social friction.</description>

      <title>Ontology-Based Knowledge Graph Framework for Industrial Standard Documents via Hierarchical and Propositional Structuring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ontology-based knowledge graph (KG) construction is a core technology that enables multidimensional understanding and advanced reasoning over domain knowledge. Industrial standards, in particular, contain extensive technical information and complex rules presented in highly structured formats that combine tables, scopes of application, constraints, exceptions, and numerical calculations, making KG construction especially challenging. In this study, we propose a method that organizes such documents into a hierarchical semantic structure, decomposes sentences and tables into atomic propositions derived from conditional and numerical rules, and integrates them into an ontology-knowledge graph through LLM-based triple extraction. Our approach captures both the hierarchical and logical structures of documents, effectively representing domain-specific semantics that conventional methods fail to reflect. To verify its effectiveness, we constructed rule, table, and multi-hop QA datasets, as well as a toxic clause detection dataset, from industrial standards, and implemented an ontology-aware KG-RAG framework for comparative evaluation. Experimental results show that our method achieves significant performance improvements across all QA types compared to existing KG-RAG approaches. This study demonstrates that reliable and scalable knowledge representation is feasible even for industrial documents with intertwined conditions, constraints, and scopes, contributing to future domain-specific RAG development and intelligent document management.</description>

      <title>Beyond Real Weights: Hypercomplex Representations for Stable Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLLMs) require large parameter capacity to align high-dimensional visual features with linguistic representations, making them computationally heavy and difficult to deploy efficiently. We introduce a progressive reparameterization strategy that compresses these models by gradually replacing dense feed-forward network blocks with compact Parameterized Hypercomplex Multiplication (PHM) layers. A residual interpolation schedule, together with lightweight reconstruction and knowledge distillation losses, ensures that the PHM modules inherit the functional behavior of their dense counterparts during training. This transition yields substantial parameter and FLOP reductions while preserving strong multimodal alignment, enabling faster inference without degrading output quality. We evaluate the approach on multiple vision-language models (VLMs). Our method maintains performance comparable to the base models while delivering significant reductions in model size and inference latency. Progressive PHM substitution thus offers an architecture-compatible path toward more efficient multimodal reasoning and complements existing low-bit quantization techniques.</description>

      <title>Pose-Based Sign Language Spotting via an End-to-End Encoder Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Sign Language Recognition (ASLR) has emerged as a vital field for bridging the gap between deaf and hearing communities. However, the problem of sign-to-sign retrieval or detecting a specific sign within a sequence of continuous signs remains largely unexplored. We define this novel task as Sign Language Spotting. In this paper, we present a first step toward sign language retrieval by addressing the challenge of detecting the presence or absence of a query sign video within a sentence-level gloss or sign video. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on intermediate gloss recognition or text-based matching, we propose an end-to-end model that directly operates on pose keypoints extracted from sign videos. Our architecture employs an encoder-only backbone with a binary classification head to determine whether the query sign appears within the target sequence. By focusing on pose representations instead of raw RGB frames, our method significantly reduces computational cost and mitigates visual noise. We evaluate our approach on the Word Presence Prediction dataset from the WSLP 2025 shared task, achieving 61.88\% accuracy and 60.00\% F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our pose-based framework for Sign Language Spotting, establishing a strong foundation for future research in automatic sign language retrieval and verification.

      <title>Revisiting the Scaling Properties of Downstream Metrics in Large Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While scaling laws for Large Language Models (LLMs) traditionally focus on proxy metrics like pretraining loss, predicting downstream task performance has been considered unreliable. This paper challenges that view by proposing a direct framework to model the scaling of benchmark performance from the training budget. We find that for a fixed token-to-parameter ratio, a simple power law can accurately describe the scaling behavior of log accuracy on multiple popular downstream tasks. Our results show that the direct approach extrapolates better than the previously proposed two-stage procedure, which is prone to compounding errors. Furthermore, we introduce functional forms that predict accuracy across token-to-parameter ratios and account for inference compute under repeated sampling. We validate our findings on models with up to 17B parameters trained on up to 350B tokens across two dataset mixtures. To support reproducibility and encourage future research, we release the complete set of pretraining losses and downstream evaluation results.</description>

      <title>Detecting value-expressive text posts in Russian social media</title>

Abstract: Basic values are concepts or beliefs which pertain to desirable end-states and transcend specific situations. Studying personal values in social media can illuminate how and why societal values evolve especially when the stimuli-based methods, such as surveys, are inefficient, for instance, in hard-to-reach populations. On the other hand, user-generated content is driven by the massive use of stereotyped, culturally defined speech constructions rather than authentic expressions of personal values. We aimed to find a model that can accurately detect value-expressive posts in Russian social media VKontakte. A training dataset of 5,035 posts was annotated by three experts, 304 crowd-workers and ChatGPT. Crowd-workers and experts showed only moderate agreement in categorizing posts. ChatGPT was more consistent but struggled with spam detection. We applied an ensemble of human- and AI-assisted annotation involving active learning approach, subsequently trained several classification models using embeddings from various pre-trained transformer-based language models. The best performance was achieved with embeddings from a fine-tuned rubert-tiny2 model, yielding high value detection quality (F1 = 0.77, F1-macro = 0.83). This model provides a crucial step to a study of values within and between Russian social media users.</description>

      <title>B-cos LM: Efficiently Transforming Pre-trained Language Models for Improved Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12992v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Post-hoc explanation methods for black-box models often struggle with faithfulness and human interpretability due to the lack of explainability in current neural architectures. Meanwhile, B-cos networks have been introduced to improve model explainability by proposing an architecture that removes bias terms and promotes input-weight alignment. Although B-cos networks have shown success in building explainable systems, their application has so far been limited to computer vision models and their associated training pipelines. In this work, we introduce B-cos LMs, i.e., B-cos Language Models (LMs) empowered for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Our approach directly transforms pre-trained language models into B-cos LMs by combining B-cos conversion and task fine-tuning, improving efficiency compared to previous methods. Automatic and human evaluation results demonstrate that B-cos LMs produce more faithful and human interpretable explanations than post-hoc methods, while maintaining task performance comparable to conventional fine-tuning. Our in-depth analysis explores how B-cos LMs differ from conventionally fine-tuned models in their learning processes and explanation patterns. Finally, we present a first exploration of transforming decoder-only models to B-cos LMs for generation tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/Ewanwong/bcos_lm.</description>

      <title>Survey and Experiments on Mental Disorder Detection via Social Media: From Large Language Models and RAG to Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mental disorders represent a critical global health challenge, and social media is increasingly viewed as a vital resource for real-time digital phenotyping and intervention. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer stronger semantic understanding and reasoning than traditional deep learning, but their use in high-stakes clinical settings is limited by hallucinations and the lack of persistent memory. However, existing literature has not sufficiently investigated how advanced enhancement techniques, specifically Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Agentic systems, can address these reliability and reasoning limitations. Here, we systematically survey the evolving landscape of LLM-based methods for social media mental disorder analysis, spanning standard pretrained language models, RAG to mitigate hallucinations and contextual gaps, and agentic systems for autonomous reasoning and multi-step intervention. We organize existing work by technical paradigm and clinical target, extending beyond common internalizing disorders to include psychotic disorders and externalizing behaviors. Additionally, the paper comprehensively evaluates the performance of LLMs, including the impact of RAG, across various tasks. This work establishes a unified benchmark for the field, paving the way for the development of trustworthy, autonomous AI systems that can deliver precise and explainable mental health support.</description>

      <title>EEG-to-Text Translation: A Model for Deciphering Human Brain Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models like Gemini, GPT, and others, bridging the gap between the human brain and language processing has become an important area of focus. To address this challenge, researchers have developed various models to decode EEG signals into text. However, these models still face significant performance limitations. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a new model, R1 Translator, which aims to improve the performance of EEG-to-text decoding. The R1 Translator model combines a bidirectional LSTM encoder with a pretrained transformer-based decoder, utilizing EEG features to produce high-quality text outputs. The model processes EEG embeddings through the LSTM to capture sequential dependencies, which are then fed into the transformer decoder for effective text generation. The R1 Translator excels in ROUGE metrics, outperforming both T5 (previous research) and Brain Translator. Specifically, R1 achieves a ROUGE-1 score of 38.00% (P), which is up to 9% higher than T5 (34.89%) and 3% better than Brain (35.69%). It also leads in ROUGE-L, with a F1 score of 32.51%, outperforming T5 by 3% (29.67%) and Brain by 2% (30.38%). In terms of CER, R1 achieves a CER of 0.5795, which is 2% lower than T5 (0.5917) and 4% lower than Brain (0.6001). Additionally, R1 performs better in WER with a score of 0.7280, outperforming T5 by 4.3% (0.7610) and Brain by 3.6% (0.7553).

      <title>OMNIGUARD: An Efficient Approach for AI Safety Moderation Across Languages and Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emerging capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked concerns about their immediate potential for harmful misuse. The core approach to mitigate these concerns is the detection of harmful queries to the model. Current detection approaches are fallible, and are particularly susceptible to attacks that exploit mismatched generalization of model capabilities (e.g., prompts in low-resource languages or prompts provided in non-text modalities such as image and audio). To tackle this challenge, we propose Omniguard, an approach for detecting harmful prompts across languages and modalities. Our approach (i) identifies internal representations of an LLM/MLLM that are aligned across languages or modalities and then (ii) uses them to build a language-agnostic or modality-agnostic classifier for detecting harmful prompts. Omniguard improves harmful prompt classification accuracy by 11.57\% over the strongest baseline in a multilingual setting, by 20.44\% for image-based prompts, and sets a new SOTA for audio-based prompts. By repurposing embeddings computed during generation, Omniguard is also very efficient ($\approx\!120 \times$ faster than the next fastest baseline). Code and data are available at: https://github.com/vsahil/OmniGuard.</description>

      <title>Bench4KE: Benchmarking Automated Competency Question Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a unique opportunity to reinvigorate research on Knowledge Engineering (KE) automation. This trend is already evident in recent efforts developing LLM-based methods and tools for the automatic generation of Competency Questions (CQs), natural language questions used by ontology engineers to define the functional requirements of an ontology. However, the evaluation of these tools lacks standardization. This undermines the methodological rigor and hinders the replication and comparison of results. To address this gap, we introduce Bench4KE, an extensible API-based benchmarking system for KE automation. The presented release focuses on evaluating tools that generate CQs automatically. Bench4KE provides a curated gold standard consisting of CQ datasets from 17 real-world ontology engineering projects and uses a suite of similarity metrics to assess the quality of the CQs generated. We present a comparative analysis of 6 recent CQ generation systems, which are based on LLMs, establishing a baseline for future research. Bench4KE is also designed to accommodate additional KE automation tasks, such as SPARQL query generation, ontology testing and drafting. Code and datasets are publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license.</description>

      <title>Shrinking the Generation-Verification Gap with Weak Verifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Verifiers can improve language model capabilities by scoring and ranking responses from generated candidates. Currently, high-quality verifiers are either unscalable (e.g., humans) or limited in utility (e.g., tools like Lean). While LM judges and reward models have become broadly useful as general-purpose verifiers, a significant performance gap remains between them and oracle verifiers (verifiers with perfect accuracy). To help close this gap, we introduce Weaver, a framework for designing a strong verifier by combining multiple weak, imperfect verifiers. We find weighted ensembles of verifiers, which typically require learning from labeled data, significantly outperform unweighted combinations due to differences in verifier accuracies. To reduce dependency on labeled data, Weaver leverages weak supervision to estimate each verifier's accuracy and combines outputs into a unified score that better reflects true response quality. However, directly applying weak supervision algorithms poses challenges, including inconsistent verifier output formats and handling low-quality verifiers. Weaver addresses these using dataset statistics to normalize outputs and filter specific verifiers. We study Weaver's effectiveness in test-time repeated sampling, where a model generates multiple candidate responses and selects one. Our evaluations show Weaver significantly improves over Pass@1-performance when selecting the first candidate-across reasoning and math tasks, achieving o3-mini-level accuracy with Llama 3.3 70B Instruct as generator, and an ensemble of 70B or smaller judge and reward models as verifiers (87.7% average). This gain mirrors the jump between GPT-4o and o3-mini (69.0% vs. 86.7%), which required extensive finetuning and post-training. To reduce computational costs of verifier ensembles, we train a 400M cross-encoder using Weaver's combined output scores.</description>

      <title>Compactor: Calibrated Query-Agnostic KV Cache Compression with Approximate Leverage Scores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very large context windows. We present Compactor, a training-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining 20% fewer tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, while being more task-robust. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated compression: inferring the maximum compression a given context supports before significant performance loss. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV memory burden by 68%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3.1 families. Finally, we release compactor-vllm, an inference engine and suite of optimized Triton kernels designed to efficiently support the sparse, non-contiguous memory access patterns inherent to compressed KV caches. This work demonstrates that Compactor offers a practical, high-performance solution for alleviating the memory bottleneck in modern LLM deployment.</description>

      <title>CLARIFID: Improving Radiology Report Generation by Reinforcing Clinically Accurate Impressions and Enforcing Detailed Findings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic generation of radiology reports has the potential to alleviate radiologists' significant workload, yet current methods struggle to deliver clinically reliable conclusions. In particular, most prior approaches focus on producing fluent text without effectively ensuring the factual correctness of the reports and often rely on single-view images, limiting diagnostic comprehensiveness. We propose CLARIFID, a novel framework that directly optimizes diagnostic correctness by mirroring the two-step workflow of experts. Specifically, CLARIFID (1) learns the logical flow from Findings to Impression through section-aware pretraining, (2) is fine-tuned with Proximal Policy Optimization in which the CheXbert F1 score of the Impression section serves as the reward, (3) employs controlled decoding that completes "Findings" before synthesizing the "Impression", and (4) fuses multiple chest X-ray views via a vision-transformer-based multi-view encoder. During inference, we apply a next-token forcing strategy followed by report-level re-ranking, ensuring that the model first produces a comprehensive "Findings" section before synthesizing the "Impression" and thereby preserving coherent clinical reasoning. Experimental results on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior clinical efficacy and outperforms existing baselines on clinical efficacy scores.</description>

      <title>LLMs Can't Handle Peer Pressure: Crumbling under Multi-Agent Social Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into multi-agent systems (MAS), where peer interactions shape individual decisions. While prior work has mainly examined conformity bias, we broaden the view to include how LLMs build rapport from prior interactions, discern and integrate high-quality peer information, and resist misleading inputs-abilities essential for achieving collective intelligence under complex social dynamics. We introduce KAIROS, a benchmark that simulates quiz-style collaboration with peer agents whose rapport levels and behaviours can be precisely controlled in both historical interactions and the current round. This unified setup enables systematic analysis of how rapport, peer actions, and the model's self-confidence jointly influence decision-making. Using KAIROS, we evaluate prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO). Results show that model scale is a primary factor moderating susceptibility to social influence: larger models are more resilient and benefit from prompting-based mitigation, whereas smaller models remain vulnerable. Only carefully configured GRPO training yields consistent robustness and performance gains for small models.</description>

      <title>SENSE models: an open source solution for multilingual and multimodal semantic-based tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces SENSE (Shared Embedding for N-lingual Speech and tExt), an open-source solution inspired by the SAMU-XLSR framework and conceptually similar to Meta AI's SONAR models. These approaches rely on a teacher-student framework to align a self-supervised speech encoder with the language-agnostic continuous representations of a text encoder at the utterance level. We describe how the original SAMU-XLSR method has been updated by selecting a stronger teacher text model and a better initial speech encoder. The source code for training and using SENSE models has been integrated into the SpeechBrain toolkit, and the first SENSE model we trained has been publicly released. We report experimental results on multilingual and multimodal semantic tasks, where our SENSE model achieves highly competitive performance. Finally, this study offers new insights into how semantics are captured in such semantically aligned speech encoders.</description>

      <title>Do Natural Language Descriptions of Model Activations Convey Privileged Information?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal representations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer LLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and operates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually provide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model, or do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate popular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that they can succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals, suggesting that these datasets may not be ideal for evaluating verbalization methods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations often reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated them, rather than the knowledge of the target LLM whose activations are decoded. Taken together, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful insights into the operations of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Knowledge-Prediction Gap in LLMs on Multiple-Choice Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) despite demonstrating correct knowledge in other contexts, such as free-form generation. To investigate the mechanism underlying this knowledge-prediction gap on MCQs and alleviate it, we conduct a probing analysis and find that residual streams in certain layers contain a subspace spanned by two important bases: a \emph{knowledge basis} that encodes the probability of the ground-truth answer for a given MCQ and a \emph{prediction basis} that encodes the probability of the answer choice predicted by the model. We observe that incorrect predictions arise from a misalignment of the model's hidden states along these two bases. Hence, we introduce \textbf{KAPPA} (Knowledge-Aligned Prediction through Projection-based Adjustment), a parameter-free intervention that transforms the hidden states to align the prediction coordinate with the knowledge coordinate within this subspace. Experiments on binary-choice reformulations of Big-Bench-Hard and ARC-Challenge show that KAPPA substantially improves accuracy and consistently outperforms baselines. While optimal subspaces differ across tasks, subspaces generalize to some extent, as supported by cross-dataset experiments. Moreover, KAPPA extends its effectiveness to free-form questions beyond MCQs. Our work provides a new geometric understanding of the knowledge-prediction gap and offers a practical method for better aligning model behavior with its latent knowledge.</description>

      <title>Dual Mechanisms of Value Expression: Intrinsic vs. Prompted Values in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can express different values in two distinct ways: (1) intrinsic expression, reflecting the model's inherent values learned during training, and (2) prompted expression, elicited by explicit prompts. Given their widespread use in value alignment and persona steering, it is paramount to clearly understand their underlying mechanisms, particularly whether they mostly overlap (as one might expect) or rely on substantially different mechanisms, but this remains largely understudied. We analyze this at the mechanistic level using two approaches: (1) value vectors, feature directions representing value mechanisms extracted from the residual stream, and (2) value neurons, MLP neurons that contribute to value expressions. We demonstrate that intrinsic and prompted value mechanisms partly share common components that are crucial for inducing value expression, but also possess unique elements that manifest in different ways. As a result, these mechanisms lead to different degrees of value steerability (prompted &gt; intrinsic) and response diversity (intrinsic &gt; prompted). In particular, components unique to the intrinsic mechanism seem to promote lexical diversity in responses, whereas those specific to the prompted mechanism primarily strengthen instruction following, taking effect even in distant tasks like jailbreaking.</description>

      <title>MixtureVitae: Open Web-Scale Pretraining Dataset With High Quality Instruction and Reasoning Data Built from Permissive-First Text Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present MixtureVitae, an open-access pretraining corpus built to minimize legal risk while providing strong model performance. MixtureVitae follows a risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions (e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources), alongside targeted instruction, reasoning and synthetic data with documented provenance. We detail a transparent, multi-stage pipeline for license-aware filtering, safety and quality screening, and domain-aware mixing, and we release the dataset and curation recipes to support reproducible research. In controlled experiments using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures at 130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B parameters; training budgets of 50B and 300B tokens), models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B/300B setting they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM in the later stages of training. Performance is particularly strong on math/code and competitive on QA tasks. These results demonstrate that permissive-first, risk-mitigated data provides a practical and legally mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing reliance on indiscriminate web scraping without sacrificing competitiveness.

      <title>LLMSQL: Upgrading WikiSQL for the LLM Era of Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Converting natural language questions into SQL queries enables non-expert users to interact with relational databases and has long been a central task for natural language interfaces to data. While the WikiSQL dataset played a key role in early text-to-SQL research, its usage has declined due to structural and annotation issues, including case sensitivity inconsistencies, data type mismatches, syntax errors, and unanswered questions. We present LLMSQL, a systematic revision and transformation of WikiSQL designed for the large language model era. We classify these errors and implement automated methods for cleaning and re-annotation. To assess the impact of these improvements, we evaluated multiple large language models, including Gemma 3, LLaMA 3.2, Mistral 7B, gpt-oss 20B, Phi-3.5 Mini, Qwen 2.5, OpenAI o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and others. Notably, DeepSeek-R1 achieves 88.40% accuracy in a zero-shot setting, and models under 10B parameters surpass 90% accuracy after fine-tuning. Rather than serving as an update, LLMSQL is introduced as an LLM-ready benchmark. Unlike the original WikiSQL, which was tailored for pointer-network models selecting tokens from input, LLMSQL provides clean natural language questions and full SQL queries as plain text, enabling straightforward generation and evaluation for modern natural-language-to-SQL models.</description>

      <title>Can AI Truly Represent Your Voice in Deliberations? A Comprehensive Study of Large-Scale Opinion Aggregation with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale public deliberations generate thousands of free-form contributions that must be synthesized into representative and neutral summaries for policy use. While LLMs have been shown as a promising tool to generate summaries for large-scale deliberations, they also risk underrepresenting minority perspectives and exhibiting bias with respect to the input order, raising fairness concerns in high-stakes contexts. Studying and fixing these issues requires a comprehensive evaluation at a large scale, yet current practice often relies on LLMs as judges, which show weak alignment with human judgments. To address this, we present DeliberationBank, a large-scale human-grounded dataset with (1) opinion data spanning ten deliberation questions created by 3,000 participants and (2) summary judgment data annotated by 4,500 participants across four dimensions (representativeness, informativeness, neutrality, policy approval). Using these datasets, we train DeliberationJudge, a fine-tuned DeBERTa model that can rate deliberation summaries from individual perspectives. DeliberationJudge is more efficient and more aligned with human judgements compared to a wide range of LLM judges. With DeliberationJudge, we evaluate 18 LLMs and reveal persistent weaknesses in deliberation summarization, especially underrepresentation of minority positions. Our framework provides a scalable and reliable way to evaluate deliberation summarization, helping ensure AI systems are more representative and equitable for policymaking.</description>

      <title>StreamingThinker: Large Language Models Can Think While Reading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chain of thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the current LLM reasoning paradigm initiates thinking only after the entire input is available, which introduces unnecessary latency and weakens attention to earlier information in dynamic scenarios. Inspired by human cognition of thinking while reading, we first design a \textit{\textbf{streaming thinking}} paradigm for LLMs, where reasoning unfolds in the order of input and further adjusts its depth once reading is complete. We instantiate this paradigm with \textit{StreamingThinker}, a framework that enables LLMs to think while reading through the integration of streaming CoT generation, streaming-constraint training, and streaming parallel inference. Specifically, StreamingThinker employs streaming reasoning units with quality control for CoT generation, enforces order-preserving reasoning through streaming attention masks and position encoding, and leverages parallel KV caches that decouple input encoding from reasoning generation, thereby ensuring alignment and enabling true concurrency. We evaluate StreamingThinker on the Qwen3 model family across math reasoning, logical reasoning, and context-based QA reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that the StreamingThinker preserves performance comparable to batch thinking, while yielding an 80\% reduction in token waiting before the onset of reasoning and a more than 60\% reduction in time-level latency for producing the final answer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the streaming paradigm for LLM reasoning. Code will be released at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/StreamingLLM/tree/main/StreamingThinker.</description>

      <title>Do Language Models Associate Sound with Meaning? A Multimodal Study of Sound Symbolism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sound symbolism is a linguistic concept that refers to non-arbitrary associations between phonetic forms and their meanings. We suggest that this can be a compelling probe into how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) interpret auditory information in human languages. We investigate MLLMs' performance on phonetic iconicity across textual (orthographic and IPA) and auditory forms of inputs with up to 25 semantic dimensions (e.g., sharp vs. round), observing models' layer-wise information processing by measuring phoneme-level attention fraction scores. To this end, we present LEX-ICON, an extensive mimetic word dataset consisting of 8,052 words from four natural languages (English, French, Japanese, and Korean) and 2,930 systematically constructed pseudo-words, annotated with semantic features applied across both text and audio modalities. Our key findings demonstrate (1) MLLMs' phonetic intuitions that align with existing linguistic research across multiple semantic dimensions and (2) phonosemantic attention patterns that highlight models' focus on iconic phonemes. These results bridge domains of artificial intelligence and cognitive linguistics, providing the first large-scale, quantitative analyses of phonetic iconicity in terms of MLLMs' interpretability.</description>

      <title>AraLingBench A Human-Annotated Benchmark for Evaluating Arabic Linguistic Capabilities of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present AraLingBench: a fully human annotated benchmark for evaluating the Arabic linguistic competence of large language models (LLMs). The benchmark spans five core categories: grammar, morphology, spelling, reading comprehension, and syntax, through 150 expert-designed multiple choice questions that directly assess structural language understanding. Evaluating 35 Arabic and bilingual LLMs reveals that current models demonstrate strong surface level proficiency but struggle with deeper grammatical and syntactic reasoning. AraLingBench highlights a persistent gap between high scores on knowledge-based benchmarks and true linguistic mastery, showing that many models succeed through memorization or pattern recognition rather than authentic comprehension. By isolating and measuring fundamental linguistic skills, AraLingBench provides a diagnostic framework for developing Arabic LLMs. The full evaluation code is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>TS-PEFT: Unveiling Token-Level Redundancy in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods typically operate under an implicit assumption: once a target module is selected, every token passing through it contributes equally to the downstream task and requires a parameter update. In this paper, we challenge this convention and unveil a pervasive token-level redundancy in the fine-tuning of large models. We propose TS-PEFT, a theoretically grounded framework utilizing proximal optimization to dynamically identify and skip redundant token updates during training. Our extensive experiments across Natural Language Understanding, Commonsense Reasoning, and Visual Instruction Tuning demonstrate that indiscriminately updating all tokens is not only computationally superfluous but often introduces optimization noise. Strikingly, by discarding 40%-60% of token updates, TS-PEFT consistently matches or surpasses the performance of dense baselines (e.g., LoRA, DoRA). Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis revealing that the learned token-level sparsity serves as a superior indicator of module importance compared to traditional weight norms, offering a novel data-driven perspective on the intrinsic adaptation mechanism of large models.</description>

      <title>DiscoVerse: Multi-Agent Pharmaceutical Co-Scientist for Traceable Drug Discovery and Reverse Translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pharmaceutical research and development has accumulated vast and heterogeneous archives of data. Much of this knowledge stems from discontinued programs, and reusing these archives is invaluable for reverse translation. However, in practice, such reuse is often infeasible. In this work, we introduce DiscoVerse, a multi-agent co-scientist designed to support pharmaceutical research and development at Roche. Designed as a human-in-the-loop assistant, DiscoVerse enables domain-specific queries by delivering evidence-based answers: it retrieves relevant data, links across documents, summarises key findings and preserves institutional memory. We assess DiscoVerse through expert evaluation of source-linked outputs. Our evaluation spans a selected subset of 180 molecules from Roche's research and development repositories, encompassing over 0.87 billion BPE tokens and more than four decades of research. To our knowledge, this represents the first agentic framework to be systematically assessed on real pharmaceutical data for reverse translation, enabled by authorized access to confidential archives covering the full lifecycle of drug development. Our contributions include: role-specialized agent designs aligned with scientist workflows; human-in-the-loop support for reverse translation; expert evaluation; and a large-scale demonstration showing promising decision-making insights. In brief, across seven benchmark queries, DiscoVerse achieved near-perfect recall ($\geq 0.99$) with moderate precision ($0.71-0.91$). Qualitative assessments and three real-world pharmaceutical use cases further showed faithful, source-linked synthesis across preclinical and clinical evidence.</description>

      <title>Representational Stability of Truth in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for factual tasks such as "What treats asthma?" or "What is the capital of Latvia?". However, it remains unclear how stably LLMs encode distinctions between true, false, and neither-true-nor-false content in their internal probabilistic representations. We introduce representational stability as the robustness of an LLM's veracity representations to perturbations in the operational definition of truth. We assess representational stability by (i) training a linear probe on an LLM's activations to separate true from not-true statements and (ii) measuring how its learned decision boundary shifts under controlled label changes. Using activations from sixteen open-source models and three factual domains, we compare two types of neither statements. The first are fact-like assertions about entities we believe to be absent from any training data. We call these unfamiliar neither statements. The second are nonfactual claims drawn from well-known fictional contexts. We call these familiar neither statements. The unfamiliar statements induce the largest boundary shifts, producing up to $40\%$ flipped truth judgements in fragile domains (such as word definitions), while familiar fictional statements remain more coherently clustered and yield smaller changes ($\leq 8.2\%$). These results suggest that representational stability stems more from epistemic familiarity than from linguistic form. More broadly, our approach provides a diagnostic for auditing and training LLMs to preserve coherent truth assignments under semantic uncertainty, rather than optimizing for output accuracy alone.</description>

      <title>Mortgage Language Model: Domain-Adaptive Pretraining with Residual Instruction, Alignment Tuning, and Task-Specific Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across general domains, yet their application to specialized sectors such as mortgage finance requires domain-specific knowledge augmentation while preserving instruction-following fidelity. We present MortgageLLM, a novel domain-specific large language model that addresses this dual challenge. It is developed using a dual-track specialization framework from a single base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). We opted for this dual-expert approach as a single multi-task model suffers from performance trade-offs, where optimizing for structured tasks (via SFT) degrades conversational fidelity (via DPO). Our dual-track method solves this by creating two specialists, allowing each to be optimally trained for its distinct capability. Our approach applies the instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning. We contribute: (1) application of this residual technique to the highly specialized mortgage finance domain; (2) a dual-expert architecture combining a conversational Q&amp;A model and a structured task model for classification and summarization; and (3) an intelligent task routing mechanism using few-shot classification performed by one of the expert models itself. We validate our approach on domain-specific benchmarks, where our final model (MLM v2) significantly outperforms the base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, achieving an LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score of 4.58 (vs. 3.99), a Q&amp;A score of 4.09 (vs. 4.0), and a classification score of 2.6 (vs. 1.2). On semantic similarity, our model achieved a BERTScore of 0.77 for summarization (vs. 0.74), 0.68 for Q&amp;A (vs. 0.58), and 0.75 for classification (vs. 0.73), substantially outperforming baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Understanding LLM Reasoning for Abstractive Summarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in analytical tasks such as mathematics and code generation, their utility for abstractive summarization remains widely assumed but largely unverified. To bridge this gap, we first tailor general reasoning strategies to the summarization domain. We then conduct a systematic, large scale comparative study of 8 reasoning strategies and 3 Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) across 8 diverse datasets, assessing both summary quality and faithfulness. Our findings show that reasoning is not a universal solution and its effectiveness is highly dependent on the specific strategy and context. Specifically, we observe a trade-off between summary quality and factual faithfulness: explicit reasoning strategies tend to improve fluency at the expense of factual grounding, while implicit reasoning in LRMs exhibits the inverse pattern. Furthermore, increasing an LRM's internal reasoning budget does not improve, and can even hurt, factual consistency, suggesting that effective summarization demands faithful compression rather than creative over-thinking.</description>

      <title>Arbitrage: Efficient Reasoning via Advantage-Aware Speculation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern Large Language Models achieve impressive reasoning capabilities with long Chain of Thoughts, but they incur substantial computational cost during inference, and this motivates techniques to improve the performance-cost ratio. Among these techniques, Speculative Decoding accelerates inference by employing a fast but inaccurate draft model to autoregressively propose tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a more capable target model. However, due to unnecessary rejections caused by token mismatches in semantically equivalent steps, traditional token-level Speculative Decoding struggles in reasoning tasks. Although recent works have shifted to step-level semantic verification, which improve efficiency by accepting or rejecting entire reasoning steps, existing step-level methods still regenerate many rejected steps with little improvement, wasting valuable target compute. To address this challenge, we propose Arbitrage, a novel step-level speculative generation framework that routes generation dynamically based on the relative advantage between draft and target models. Instead of applying a fixed acceptance threshold, Arbitrage uses a lightweight router trained to predict when the target model is likely to produce a meaningfully better step. This routing approximates an ideal Arbitrage Oracle that always chooses the higher-quality step, achieving near-optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, Arbitrage consistently surpasses prior step-level Speculative Decoding baselines, reducing inference latency by up to $\sim2\times$ at matched accuracy.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Causal Sensemaking: Closing the Complementarity Gap in Human-AI Decision Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed for expert decision support, yet human-AI teams in high-stakes settings do not yet reliably outperform the best individual. We argue this complementarity gap reflects a fundamental mismatch: current agents are trained as answer engines, not as partners in the collaborative sensemaking through which experts actually make decisions. Sensemaking (the ability to co-construct causal explanations, surface uncertainties, and adapt goals) is the key capability that current training pipelines do not explicitly develop or evaluate. We propose Collaborative Causal Sensemaking (CCS) as a research agenda to develop this capability from the ground up, spanning new training environments that reward collaborative thinking, representations for shared human-AI mental models, and evaluation centred on trust and complementarity. These directions can advance MAS research toward agents that think with their human partners rather than for them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17537v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring biodiversity is crucial for understanding ecosystem health. While prior works have developed machine learning models for taxonomic classification of photographic images and DNA separately, in this work, we introduce a multimodal approach combining both, using CLIP-style contrastive learning to align images, barcode DNA, and text-based representations of taxonomic labels in a unified embedding space. This allows for accurate classification of both known and unknown insect species without task-specific fine-tuning, leveraging contrastive learning for the first time to fuse barcode DNA and image data. Our method surpasses previous single-modality approaches in accuracy by over 8% on zero-shot learning tasks, showcasing its effectiveness in biodiversity studies.</description>

      <title>SimSUM: Simulated Benchmark with Structured and Unstructured Medical Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08936v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clinical information extraction, which involves structuring clinical concepts from unstructured medical text, remains a challenging problem that could benefit from the inclusion of tabular background information available in electronic health records. Existing open-source datasets lack explicit links between structured features and clinical concepts in the text, motivating the need for a new research dataset. We introduce SimSUM, a benchmark dataset of 10,000 simulated patient records that link unstructured clinical notes with structured background variables. Each record simulates a patient encounter in the domain of respiratory diseases and includes tabular data (e.g., symptoms, diagnoses, underlying conditions) generated from a Bayesian network whose structure and parameters are defined by domain experts. A large language model (GPT-4o) is prompted to generate a clinical note describing the encounter, including symptoms and relevant context. These notes are annotated with span-level symptom mentions. We conduct an expert evaluation to assess note quality and run baseline predictive models on both the tabular and textual data. The SimSUM dataset is primarily designed to support research on clinical information extraction in the presence of tabular background variables, which can be linked through domain knowledge to concepts of interest to be extracted from the text -- namely, symptoms in the case of SimSUM. Secondary uses include research on the automation of clinical reasoning over both tabular data and text, causal effect estimation in the presence of tabular and/or textual confounders, and multi-modal synthetic data generation. SimSUM is not intended for training clinical decision support systems or production-grade models, but rather to facilitate reproducible research in a simplified and controlled setting.</description>

      <title>AEIOU: A Unified Defense Framework against NSFW Prompts in Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As text-to-image (T2I) models advance and gain widespread adoption, their associated safety concerns are becoming increasingly critical. Malicious users exploit these models to generate Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) images using harmful or adversarial prompts, underscoring the need for effective safeguards to ensure the integrity and compliance of model outputs. However, existing detection methods often exhibit low accuracy and inefficiency. In this paper, we propose AEIOU, a defense framework that is adaptable, efficient, interpretable, optimizable, and unified against NSFW prompts in T2I models. AEIOU extracts NSFW features from the hidden states of the model's text encoder, utilizing the separable nature of these features to detect NSFW prompts. The detection process is efficient, requiring minimal inference time. AEIOU also offers real-time interpretation of results and supports optimization through data augmentation techniques. The framework is versatile, accommodating various T2I architectures. Our extensive experiments show that AEIOU significantly outperforms both commercial and open-source moderation tools, achieving over 95\% accuracy across all datasets and improving efficiency by at least tenfold. It effectively counters adaptive attacks and excels in few-shot and multi-label scenarios.</description>

      <title>Make LVLMs Focus: Context-Aware Attention Modulation for Better Multimodal In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) is becoming a key capability that allows large vision-language models (LVLMs) to adapt to novel tasks without parameter updates, which expands their usefulness in many real-world applications. However, ICL performance remains unstable even when the in-context demonstrations (ICDs) are well matched, showing that LVLMs still struggle to make full use of the provided context. While existing work mainly focuses on prompt engineering or post-hoc logit calibration, we study the attention mechanisms inside LVLMs to address their inherent limitations. We identify two important weaknesses in their self-attention that hinder effective ICL. To address these weaknesses, we propose \textbf{Context-Aware Modulated Attention} (CAMA), a training-free and plug-and-play method that dynamically adjusts attention logits based on the input in-context sequence. CAMA uses a two-stage modulation process that strengthens attention to semantically important tokens, especially visual ones. Across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks, CAMA consistently outperforms vanilla models and baselines, showing clear effectiveness and generalization. It can also activate the intended benefits of prompt engineering methods and remains robust across different sequence configurations. Therefore, CAMA opens up new directions for improving multimodal reasoning through a deeper understanding of attention dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Grounding on Egocentric Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal video grounding aims to localize target entities in videos based on textual queries. While existing research has made significant progress in exocentric videos, the egocentric setting remains relatively underexplored, despite its growing importance in applications such as augmented reality and robotics. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of the discrepancies between egocentric and exocentric videos, revealing key challenges such as shorter object durations, sparser trajectories, smaller object sizes, and larger positional shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce EgoMask, the first pixel-level benchmark for fine-grained spatiotemporal grounding in egocentric videos. It is constructed by our proposed automatic annotation pipeline, which annotates referring expressions and object masks across short-, medium-, and long-term videos. Additionally, we create EgoMask-Train, a large-scale training dataset to facilitate model development. Experiments demonstrate that the state-of-the-art spatiotemporal grounding models perform poorly on our benchmark EgoMask, but fine-tuning on EgoMask-Train yields significant improvements, while preserving performance on exocentric datasets. Our work thus provides essential resources and insights for advancing egocentric video understanding. Our code is available at https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/EgoMask .</description>

      <title>ScamAgents: How AI Agents Can Simulate Human-Level Scam Calls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive fluency and reasoning capabilities, but their potential for misuse has raised growing concern. In this paper, we present ScamAgent, an autonomous multi-turn agent built on top of LLMs, capable of generating highly realistic scam call scripts that simulate real-world fraud scenarios. Unlike prior work focused on single-shot prompt misuse, ScamAgent maintains dialogue memory, adapts dynamically to simulated user responses, and employs deceptive persuasion strategies across conversational turns. We show that current LLM safety guardrails, including refusal mechanisms and content filters, are ineffective against such agent-based threats. Even models with strong prompt-level safeguards can be bypassed when prompts are decomposed, disguised, or delivered incrementally within an agent framework. We further demonstrate the transformation of scam scripts into lifelike voice calls using modern text-to-speech systems, completing a fully automated scam pipeline. Our findings highlight an urgent need for multi-turn safety auditing, agent-level control frameworks, and new methods to detect and disrupt conversational deception powered by generative AI.</description>

      <title>You May Speak Freely: Improving the Fine-Grained Visual Recognition Capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models with Answer Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge. Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings, we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural language.</description>

      <title>When Many-Shot Prompting Fails: An Empirical Study of LLM Code Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with vast context windows offer new avenues for in-context learning (ICL), where providing many examples ("many-shot" prompting) is often assumed to enhance performance. We investigate this assumption for the complex task of code translation. Through a large-scale empirical study of over 90,000 translations, we systematically evaluate the impact of scaling in-context examples from zero-shot to many-shot configurations of up to 625 examples, with prompts spanning from approximately 100,000 to 800,000 tokens. Our findings reveal a "many-shot paradox": while static similarity metrics may modestly improve with more examples, functional correctness consistently peaks with few-shot prompting (5-25 examples). Providing substantially more examples often degrades this crucial functional performance. This study highlights that for code translation, the quality of a few well-chosen examples outweighs sheer quantity, challenging the universal efficacy of "more is better" for ICL and underscoring the task-dependent nature of optimal prompting strategies. Our results have significant implications for effectively leveraging LLMs in software engineering.</description>

      <title>Small Drafts, Big Verdict: Information-Intensive Visual Reasoning via Speculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K. By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large proprietary models or training pipelines.

      <description>arXiv:2510.24411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computer-using agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated human-like capabilities in operating digital environments like mobile platforms. While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/OS-Copilot/OS-Sentinel.</description>

      <title>ProgRAG: Hallucination-Resistant Progressive Retrieval and Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities but struggle with hallucinations and limited transparency. Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question. At each step, external retrievers gather candidate evidence, which is then refined through uncertainty-aware pruning by the LLM. Finally, the context for LLM reasoning is optimized by organizing and rearranging the partial reasoning paths obtained from the sub-question answers. Experiments on three well-known datasets demonstrate that ProgRAG outperforms existing baselines in multi-hop KGQA, offering improved reliability and reasoning quality.</description>

Abstract: We introduce SynBullying, a synthetic multi-LLM conversational dataset for studying and detecting cyberbullying (CB). SynBullying provides a scalable and ethically safe alternative to human data collection by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to simulate realistic bullying interactions. The dataset offers (i) conversational structure, capturing multi-turn exchanges rather than isolated posts; (ii) context-aware annotations, where harmfulness is assessed within the conversational flow considering context, intent, and discourse dynamics; and (iii) fine-grained labeling, covering various CB categories for detailed linguistic and behavioral analysis. We evaluate SynBullying across five dimensions, including conversational structure, lexical patterns, sentiment/toxicity, role dynamics, harm intensity, and CB-type distribution. We further examine its utility by testing its performance as standalone training data and as an augmentation source for CB classification.</description>

Abstract: Although synthetic data is widely promoted as a remedy, its prevailing production paradigm -- one optimizing for statistical smoothness -- systematically removes the long-tail, cognitively grounded irregularities that characterize human text. Prolonged training on such statistically optimal but cognitively impoverished data accelerates model collapse.
  This paper proposes a paradigm shift: instead of imitating the surface properties of data, we simulate the cognitive processes that generate human text. We introduce the Prompt-driven Cognitive Computing Framework (PMCSF), whose core consists of a Cognitive State Decoder (CSD) that reverse-engineers unstructured text into structured cognitive vectors, and a Cognitive Text Encoder (CTE) that re-materializes these states into text enriched with human-typical imperfections via mathematically defined Cognitive Perturbation Operators.
  The framework is validated through a two-stage objective evaluation pipeline. First, in cognitive codec verification, CTE text yields a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.0614 from human text (vs. 0.4431 for standard LLM output), passes double-blind professional media review, and achieves an intraclass correlation coefficient ICC &gt; 0.9 for cognitive profile alignment across heterogeneous models. Second, in functional gain evaluation, isomorphic stress tests in the A-share market show that strategies incorporating CTE-generated data reduce maximum drawdown by 47.4% during the 2015 crash and deliver 8.6% Defensive Alpha, exceeding transaction costs by a factor of 33.
  Our findings demonstrate that modelling human cognitive limitations -- not copying surface data -- enables synthetic data with genuine functional gain, offering a viable technical pathway toward resolving the AI data-collapse crisis.</description>

      <title>The AI Consumer Index (ACE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04921v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first version of the AI Consumer Index (ACE), a benchmark for assessing whether frontier AI models can perform everyday consumer tasks. ACE contains a hidden heldout set of 400 test cases, split across four consumer activities: shopping, food, gaming, and DIY. We are also open sourcing 80 cases as a devset with a CC-BY license. For the ACE leaderboard we evaluated 10 frontier models (with websearch turned on) using a novel grading methodology that dynamically checks whether relevant parts of the response are grounded in the retrieved web sources. GPT 5 (Thinking = High) is the top-performing model, scoring 56.1%, followed by o3 Pro (Thinking = On) at 55.2% and GPT 5.1 (Thinking = High) at 55.1%. Model scores differ across domains, and in Shopping the top model scores under 50\%. We find that models are prone to hallucinating key information, such as prices. ACE shows a substantial gap between the performance of even the best models and consumers' AI needs.</description>

      <title>Pay Less Attention to Function Words for Free Robustness of Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address the trade-off between robustness and performance for robust VLM, we observe that function words could incur vulnerability of VLMs against cross-modal adversarial attacks, and propose Function-word De-Attention (FDA) accordingly to mitigate the impact of function words. Similar to differential amplifiers, our FDA calculates the original and the function-word cross-attention within attention heads, and differentially subtracts the latter from the former for more aligned and robust VLMs. Comprehensive experiments include 2 SOTA baselines under 6 different attacks on 2 downstream tasks, 3 datasets, and 3 models. Overall, our FDA yields an average 18/13/53% ASR drop with only 0.2/0.3/0.6% performance drops on the 3 tested models on retrieval, and a 90% ASR drop with a 0.3% performance gain on visual grounding. We demonstrate the scalability, generalization, and zero-shot performance of FDA experimentally, as well as in-depth ablation studies and analysis. Code will be made publicly at https://github.com/michaeltian108/FDA.</description>
