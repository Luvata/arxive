      <title>Cyclic Supports in Recursive Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks: Semantics and LP Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dung's Abstract Argumentation Framework (AF) has emerged as a key formalism for argumentation in Artificial Intelligence. It has been extended in several directions, including the possibility to express supports, leading to the development of the Bipolar Argumentation Framework (BAF), and recursive attacks and supports, resulting in the Recursive BAF (Rec-BAF). Different interpretations of supports have been proposed, whereas for Rec-BAF (where the target of attacks and supports may also be attacks and supports) even different semantics for attacks have been defined. However, the semantics of these frameworks have either not been defined in the presence of support cycles, or are often quite intricate in terms of the involved definitions. We encompass this limitation and present classical semantics for general BAF and Rec-BAF and show that the semantics for specific BAF and Rec-BAF frameworks can be defined by very simple and intuitive modifications of that defined for the case of AF. This is achieved by providing a modular definition of the sets of defeated and acceptable elements for each AF-based framework. We also characterize, in an elegant and uniform way, the semantics of general BAF and Rec-BAF in terms of logic programming and partial stable model semantics.</description>

      <title>Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has achieved remarkable success in addressing the challenges of Large Language Models (LLMs) without necessitating retraining. By referencing an external knowledge base, RAG refines LLM outputs, effectively mitigating issues such as ``hallucination'', lack of domain-specific knowledge, and outdated information. However, the complex structure of relationships among different entities in databases presents challenges for RAG systems. In response, GraphRAG leverages structural information across entities to enable more precise and comprehensive retrieval, capturing relational knowledge and facilitating more accurate, context-aware responses. Given the novelty and potential of GraphRAG, a systematic review of current technologies is imperative. This paper provides the first comprehensive overview of GraphRAG methodologies. We formalize the GraphRAG workflow, encompassing Graph-Based Indexing, Graph-Guided Retrieval, and Graph-Enhanced Generation. We then outline the core technologies and training methods at each stage. Additionally, we examine downstream tasks, application domains, evaluation methodologies, and industrial use cases of GraphRAG. Finally, we explore future research directions to inspire further inquiries and advance progress in the field.</description>

      <title>VerilogCoder: Autonomous Verilog Coding Agents with Graph-based Planning and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based Waveform Tracing Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the growing complexity of modern Integrated Circuits (ICs), automating hardware design can prevent a significant amount of human error from the engineering process and result in less errors. Verilog is a popular hardware description language for designing and modeling digital systems; thus, Verilog generation is one of the emerging areas of research to facilitate the design process. In this work, we propose VerilogCoder, a system of multiple Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents for Verilog code generation, to autonomously write Verilog code and fix syntax and functional errors using collaborative Verilog tools (i.e., syntax checker, simulator, and waveform tracer). Firstly, we propose a task planner that utilizes a novel Task and Circuit Relation Graph retrieval method to construct a holistic plan based on module descriptions. To debug and fix functional errors, we develop a novel and efficient abstract syntax tree (AST)-based waveform tracing tool, which is integrated within the autonomous Verilog completion flow. The proposed methodology successfully generates 94.2% syntactically and functionally correct Verilog code, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods by 33.9% on the VerilogEval-Human v2 benchmark.</description>

      <title>Imprecise Belief Fusion Facing a DST benchmark problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When we merge information in Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST), we are faced with anomalous behavior: agents with equal expertise and credibility can have their opinion disregarded after resorting to the belief combination rule of this theory. This problem is interesting because belief fusion is an inherent part of dealing with situations where available information is imprecise, as often occurs in Artificial Intelligence. We managed to identify an isomorphism betwin the DST formal apparatus into that of a Probabilistic Logic. Thus, we solved the problematic inputs affair by replacing the DST combination rule with a new fusion process aiming at eliminating anomalies proposed by that rule. We apply the new fusion method to the DST paradox Problem.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Guardrails For Large Language Models via Trust Modeling and In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guardrails have become an integral part of Large language models (LLMs), by moderating harmful or toxic response in order to maintain LLMs' alignment to human expectations. However, the existing guardrail methods do not consider different needs and access rights of individual users, and treat all the users with the same rule. This study introduces an adaptive guardrail mechanism, supported by trust modeling and enhanced with in-context learning, to dynamically modulate access to sensitive content based on user trust metrics. By leveraging a combination of direct interaction trust and authority-verified trust, the system precisely tailors the strictness of content moderation to align with the user's credibility and the specific context of their inquiries. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that the adaptive guardrail effectively meets diverse user needs, outperforming existing guardrails in practicality while securing sensitive information and precisely managing potentially hazardous content through a context-aware knowledge base. This work is the first to introduce trust-oriented concept within a guardrail system, offering a scalable solution that enriches the discourse on ethical deployment for next-generation LLMs.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Edge-based OPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical proximity correction (OPC) is crucial for pushing the boundaries of semiconductor manufacturing and enabling the continued scaling of integrated circuits. While pixel-based OPC, termed as inverse lithography technology (ILT), has gained research interest due to its flexibility and precision. Its complexity and intricate features can lead to challenges in mask writing, increased defects, and higher costs, hence hindering widespread industrial adoption. In this paper, we propose DiffOPC, a differentiable OPC framework that enjoys the virtue of both edge-based OPC and ILT. By employing a mask rule-aware gradient-based optimization approach, DiffOPC efficiently guides mask edge segment movement during mask optimization, minimizing wafer error by propagating true gradients from the cost function back to the mask edges. Our approach achieves lower edge placement error while reducing manufacturing cost by half compared to state-of-the-art OPC techniques, bridging the gap between the high accuracy of pixel-based OPC and the practicality required for industrial adoption, thus offering a promising solution for advanced semiconductor manufacturing.</description>

      <title>ASGM-KG: Unveiling Alluvial Gold Mining Through Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining (ASGM) is a low-cost yet highly destructive mining practice, leading to environmental disasters across the world's tropical watersheds. The topic of ASGM spans multiple domains of research and information, including natural and social systems, and knowledge is often atomized across a diversity of media and documents. We therefore introduce a knowledge graph (ASGM-KG) that consolidates and provides crucial information about ASGM practices and their environmental effects. The current version of ASGM-KG consists of 1,899 triples extracted using a large language model (LLM) from documents and reports published by both non-governmental and governmental organizations. These documents were carefully selected by a group of tropical ecologists with expertise in ASGM. This knowledge graph was validated using two methods. First, a small team of ASGM experts reviewed and labeled triples as factual or non-factual. Second, we devised and applied an automated factual reduction framework that relies on a search engine and an LLM for labeling triples. Our framework performs as well as five baselines on a publicly available knowledge graph and achieves over 90 accuracy on our ASGM-KG validated by domain experts. ASGM-KG demonstrates an advancement in knowledge aggregation and representation for complex, interdisciplinary environmental crises such as ASGM.</description>

      <title>Ask, Attend, Attack: A Effective Decision-Based Black-Box Targeted Attack for Image-to-Text Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While image-to-text models have demonstrated significant advancements in various vision-language tasks, they remain susceptible to adversarial attacks. Existing white-box attacks on image-to-text models require access to the architecture, gradients, and parameters of the target model, resulting in low practicality. Although the recently proposed gray-box attacks have improved practicality, they suffer from semantic loss during the training process, which limits their targeted attack performance. To advance adversarial attacks of image-to-text models, this paper focuses on a challenging scenario: decision-based black-box targeted attacks where the attackers only have access to the final output text and aim to perform targeted attacks. Specifically, we formulate the decision-based black-box targeted attack as a large-scale optimization problem. To efficiently solve the optimization problem, a three-stage process \textit{Ask, Attend, Attack}, called \textit{AAA}, is proposed to coordinate with the solver. \textit{Ask} guides attackers to create target texts that satisfy the specific semantics. \textit{Attend} identifies the crucial regions of the image for attacking, thus reducing the search space for the subsequent \textit{Attack}. \textit{Attack} uses an evolutionary algorithm to attack the crucial regions, where the attacks are semantically related to the target texts of \textit{Ask}, thus achieving targeted attacks without semantic loss. Experimental results on transformer-based and CNN+RNN-based image-to-text models confirmed the effectiveness of our proposed \textit{AAA}.</description>

      <title>On the Undecidability of Artificial Intelligence Alignment: Machines that Halt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner alignment problem, which asserts whether an arbitrary artificial intelligence (AI) model satisfices a non-trivial alignment function of its outputs given its inputs, is undecidable. This is rigorously proved by Rice's theorem, which is also equivalent to a reduction to Turing's Halting Problem, whose proof sketch is presented in this work. Nevertheless, there is an enumerable set of provenly aligned AIs that are constructed from a finite set of provenly aligned operations. Therefore, we argue that the alignment should be a guaranteed property from the AI architecture rather than a characteristic imposed post-hoc on an arbitrary AI model. Furthermore, while the outer alignment problem is the definition of a judge function that captures human values and preferences, we propose that such a function must also impose a halting constraint that guarantees that the AI model always reaches a terminal state in finite execution steps. Our work presents examples and models that illustrate this constraint and the intricate challenges involved, advancing a compelling case for adopting an intrinsically hard-aligned approach to AI systems architectures that ensures halting.</description>

      <title>On the Completeness of Conflict-Based Search: Temporally-Relative Duplicate Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conflict-Based Search (CBS) algorithm for the multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problem is that it is incomplete for problems which have no solution; if no mitigating procedure is run in parallel, CBS will run forever when given an unsolvable problem instance. In this work, we introduce Temporally-Relative Duplicate Pruning (TRDP), a technique for duplicate detection and removal in both classic and continuous-time MAPF domains. TRDP is a simple procedure which closes the long-standing theoretic loophole of incompleteness for CBS by detecting and avoiding the expansion of duplicate states. TRDP is shown both theoretically and empirically to ensure termination without a significant impact on runtime in the majority of problem instances. In certain cases, TRDP is shown to increase performance significantly</description>

      <title>Keep Calm and Relax -- HMI for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing popularity of self-driving, so-called autonomous vehicles has increased the need for human-machine interfaces~(HMI) and user interaction~(UI) to enhance passenger trust and comfort. While fallback drivers significantly influence the perceived trustfulness of self-driving vehicles, fallback drivers are an expensive solution that may not even improve vehicle safety in emergency situations. Based on a comprehensive literature review, this work delves into the potential of HMI and UI in enhancing trustfulness and emotion regulation in driverless vehicles. By analyzing the impact of various HMI and UI on passenger emotions, innovative and cost-effective concepts for improving human-vehicle interaction are conceptualized. To enable a trustful, highly comfortable, and safe ride, this work concludes by discussing whether HMI and UI are suitable for calming passengers down in emergencies, leading to smarter mobility for all.</description>

      <title>Research on color recipe recommendation based on unstructured data using TENN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, services and business models based on large language models, such as OpenAI Chatgpt, Google BARD, and Microsoft copilot, have been introduced, and the applications utilizing natural language processing with deep learning are increasing, and it is one of the natural language preprocessing methods. Conversion to machine language through tokenization and processing of unstructured data are increasing. Although algorithms that can understand and apply human language are becoming increasingly sophisticated, it is difficult to apply them to processes that rely on human emotions and senses in industries that still mainly deal with standardized data. In particular, in processes where brightness, saturation, and color information are essential, such as painting and injection molding, most small and medium-sized companies, excluding large corporations, rely on the tacit knowledge and sensibility of color mixers, and even customer companies often present non-standardized requirements. . In this paper, we proposed TENN to infer color recipe based on unstructured data with emotional natural language, and demonstrated it.</description>

      <title>Temporal Reversed Training for Spiking Neural Networks with Generalized Spatio-Temporal Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention as an ultra-low energy computing paradigm. Recent studies have focused on improving the feature extraction capability of SNNs, but they suffer from inefficient inference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective temporal reversed training (TRT) method to optimize the spatio-temporal performance of SNNs and circumvent these problems. We perturb the input temporal data by temporal reversal, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent output logits and to learn perturbation-invariant representations. For static data without temporal dimension, we generalize this strategy by exploiting the inherent temporal property of spiking neurons for spike feature temporal reversal. In addition, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to hybridize the original and temporally reversed spike firing rates and expand the implicit dimensions, which serves as spatio-temporal regularization to further enhance the generalization of the SNN. Our method involves only an additional temporal reversal operation and element-wise multiplication during training, thus incurring negligible training overhead and not affecting the inference efficiency at all. Extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic object/action recognition, and 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. In particular, with only two timesteps, our method achieves 74.77\% and 90.57\% accuracy on ImageNet and ModelNet40, respectively.</description>

      <title>Measuring Visual Sycophancy in Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and examines the phenomenon of "visual sycophancy" in multimodal language models, a term we propose to describe these models' tendency to disproportionately favor visually presented information, even when it contradicts their prior knowledge or responses. Our study employs a systematic methodology to investigate this phenomenon: we present models with images of multiple-choice questions, which they initially answer correctly, then expose the same model to versions with visually pre-marked options. Our findings reveal a significant shift in the models' responses towards the pre-marked option despite their previous correct answers. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that visual sycophancy is a consistent and quantifiable behavior across various model architectures. Our findings highlight potential limitations in the reliability of these models when processing potentially misleading visual information, raising important questions about their application in critical decision-making contexts.</description>

      <title>Unc-TTP: A Method for Classifying LLM Uncertainty to Improve In-Context Example Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across various downstream tasks. However, it is challenging for users to discern whether the responses are generated with certainty or are fabricated to meet user expectations. Estimating the uncertainty of LLMs is particularly challenging due to their vast scale and the lack of white-box access. In this work, we propose a novel Uncertainty Tripartite Testing Paradigm (Unc-TTP) to classify LLM uncertainty, via evaluating the consistency of LLM outputs when incorporating label interference into the sampling-based approach. Based on Unc-TTP outputs, we aggregate instances into certain and uncertain categories. Further, we conduct a detailed analysis of the uncertainty properties of LLMs and show Unc-TTP's superiority over the existing sampling-based methods. In addition, we leverage the obtained uncertainty information to guide in-context example selection, demonstrating that Unc-TTP obviously outperforms retrieval-based and sampling-based approaches in selecting more informative examples. Our work paves a new way to classify the uncertainty of both open- and closed-source LLMs, and introduces a practical approach to exploit this uncertainty to improve LLMs performance.</description>

      <title>Cognitive LLMs: Towards Integrating Cognitive Architectures and Large Language Models for Manufacturing Decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolving the dichotomy between the human-like yet constrained reasoning processes of Cognitive Architectures and the broad but often noisy inference behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a challenging but exciting pursuit, for enabling reliable machine reasoning capabilities in production systems. Because Cognitive Architectures are famously developed for the purpose of modeling the internal mechanisms of human cognitive decision-making at a computational level, new investigations consider the goal of informing LLMs with the knowledge necessary for replicating such processes, e.g., guided perception, memory, goal-setting, and action. Previous approaches that use LLMs for grounded decision-making struggle with complex reasoning tasks that require slower, deliberate cognition over fast and intuitive inference -- reporting issues related to the lack of sufficient grounding, as in hallucination. To resolve these challenges, we introduce LLM-ACTR, a novel neuro-symbolic architecture that provides human-aligned and versatile decision-making by integrating the ACT-R Cognitive Architecture with LLMs. Our framework extracts and embeds knowledge of ACT-R's internal decision-making process as latent neural representations, injects this information into trainable LLM adapter layers, and fine-tunes the LLMs for downstream prediction. Our experiments on novel Design for Manufacturing tasks show both improved task performance as well as improved grounded decision-making capability of our approach, compared to LLM-only baselines that leverage chain-of-thought reasoning strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the use of a large language model system to improve efficiency and quality in emergency department (ED) discharge letter writing. Time constraints and infrastructural deficits make compliance with current discharge letter targets difficult. We explored potential efficiencies from an artificial intelligence software in the generation of ED discharge letters and the attitudes of doctors toward this technology. The evaluated system leverages advanced techniques to fine-tune a model to generate discharge summaries from short-hand inputs, including voice, text, and electronic health record data. Nineteen physicians with emergency medicine experience evaluated the system text and voice-to-text interfaces against manual typing. The results showed significant time savings with MedWrite LLM interfaces compared to manual methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: As Machine Learning (ML) advances rapidly in many fields, it is being adopted by academics and businesses alike. However, ML has a number of different challenges in terms of maintenance not found in traditional software projects. Identifying what causes these maintainability challenges can help mitigate them early and continue delivering value in the long run without degrading ML performance. Aim: This study aims to identify and synthesise the maintainability challenges in different stages of the ML workflow and understand how these stages are interdependent and impact each other's maintainability. Method: Using a systematic literature review, we screened more than 13000 papers, then selected and qualitatively analysed 56 of them. Results: (i) a catalogue of maintainability challenges in different stages of Data Engineering, Model Engineering workflows and the current challenges when building ML systems are discussed; (ii) a map of 13 maintainability challenges to different interdependent stages of ML that impact the overall workflow; (iii) Provided insights to developers of ML tools and researchers. Conclusions: In this study, practitioners and organisations will learn about maintainability challenges and their impact at different stages of ML workflow. This will enable them to avoid pitfalls and help to build a maintainable ML system. The implications and challenges will also serve as a basis for future research to strengthen our understanding of the ML system's maintainability.</description>

      <title>FEDMEKI: A Benchmark for Scaling Medical Foundation Models via Federated Knowledge Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces the Federated Medical Knowledge Injection (FEDMEKI) platform, a new benchmark designed to address the unique challenges of integrating medical knowledge into foundation models under privacy constraints. By leveraging a cross-silo federated learning approach, FEDMEKI circumvents the issues associated with centralized data collection, which is often prohibited under health regulations like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the USA. The platform is meticulously designed to handle multi-site, multi-modal, and multi-task medical data, which includes 7 medical modalities, including images, signals, texts, laboratory test results, vital signs, input variables, and output variables. The curated dataset to validate FEDMEKI covers 8 medical tasks, including 6 classification tasks (lung opacity detection, COVID-19 detection, electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormal detection, mortality prediction, sepsis prediction, and enlarged cardiomediastinum detection) and 2 generation tasks (medical visual question answering (MedVQA) and ECG noise clarification). This comprehensive dataset is partitioned across several clients to facilitate the decentralized training process under 16 benchmark approaches. FEDMEKI not only preserves data privacy but also enhances the capability of medical foundation models by allowing them to learn from a broader spectrum of medical knowledge without direct data exposure, thereby setting a new benchmark in the application of foundation models within the healthcare sector.</description>

      <title>Siamese Multiple Attention Temporal Convolution Networks for Human Mobility Signature Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Human Mobility Signature Identification (HuMID) problem stands as a fundamental task within the realm of driving style representation, dedicated to discerning latent driving behaviors and preferences from diverse driver trajectories for driver identification. Its solutions hold significant implications across various domains (e.g., ride-hailing, insurance), wherein their application serves to safeguard users and mitigate potential fraudulent activities. Present HuMID solutions often exhibit limitations in adaptability when confronted with lengthy trajectories, consequently incurring substantial computational overhead. Furthermore, their inability to effectively extract crucial local information further impedes their performance. To address this problem, we propose a Siamese Multiple Attention Temporal Convolutional Network (Siamese MA-TCN) to capitalize on the strengths of both TCN architecture and multi-head self-attention, enabling the proficient extraction of both local and long-term dependencies. Additionally, we devise a novel attention mechanism tailored for the efficient aggregation of multi-scale representations derived from our model. Experimental evaluations conducted on two real-world taxi trajectory datasets reveal that our proposed model effectively extracts both local key information and long-term dependencies. These findings highlight the model's outstanding generalization capabilities, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability across datasets of varying sizes.</description>

      <title>Concept Distillation from Strong to Weak Models via Hypotheses-to-Theories Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hand-crafting high quality prompts to optimize the performance of language models is a complicated and labor-intensive process. Furthermore, when migrating to newer, smaller, or weaker models (possibly due to latency or cost gains), prompts need to be updated to re-optimize the task performance. We propose Concept Distillation (CD), an automatic prompt optimization technique for enhancing weaker models on complex tasks. CD involves: (1) collecting mistakes made by weak models with a base prompt (initialization), (2) using a strong model to generate reasons for these mistakes and create rules/concepts for weak models (induction), and (3) filtering these rules based on validation set performance and integrating them into the base prompt (deduction/verification). We evaluated CD on NL2Code and mathematical reasoning tasks, observing significant performance boosts for small and weaker language models. Notably, Mistral-7B's accuracy on Multi-Arith increased by 20%, and Phi-3-mini-3.8B's accuracy on HumanEval rose by 34%. Compared to other automated methods, CD offers an effective, cost-efficient strategy for improving weak models' performance on complex tasks and enables seamless workload migration across different language models without compromising performance.</description>

      <title>ELASTIC: Efficient Linear Attention for Sequential Interest Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art sequential recommendation models heavily rely on transformer's attention mechanism. However, the quadratic computational and memory complexities of self attention have limited its scalability for modeling users' long range behaviour sequences. To address this problem, we propose ELASTIC, an Efficient Linear Attention for SequenTial Interest Compression, requiring only linear time complexity and decoupling model capacity from computational cost. Specifically, ELASTIC introduces a fixed length interest experts with linear dispatcher attention mechanism which compresses the long-term behaviour sequences to a significantly more compact representation which reduces up to 90% GPU memory usage with x2.7 inference speed up. The proposed linear dispatcher attention mechanism significantly reduces the quadratic complexity and makes the model feasible for adequately modeling extremely long sequences. Moreover, in order to retain the capacity for modeling various user interests, ELASTIC initializes a vast learnable interest memory bank and sparsely retrieves compressed user's interests from the memory with a negligible computational overhead. The proposed interest memory retrieval technique significantly expands the cardinality of available interest space while keeping the same computational cost, thereby striking a trade-off between recommendation accuracy and efficiency. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed ELASTIC, we conduct extensive experiments on various public datasets and compare it with several strong sequential recommenders. Experimental results demonstrate that ELASTIC consistently outperforms baselines by a significant margin and also highlight the computational efficiency of ELASTIC when modeling long sequences. We will make our implementation code publicly available.</description>

      <title>Game Development as Human-LLM Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Game development is a highly specialized task that relies on a complex game engine powered by complex programming languages, preventing many gaming enthusiasts from handling it. This paper introduces the Interaction-driven Game Engine (IGE) powered by LLM, which allows everyone to develop a custom game using natural language through Human-LLM interaction. To enable an LLM to function as an IGE, we instruct it to perform the following processes in each turn: (1) $P_{script}$ : configure the game script segment based on the user's input; (2) $P_{code}$ : generate the corresponding code snippet based on the game script segment; (3) $P_{utter}$ : interact with the user, including guidance and feedback. We propose a data synthesis pipeline based on the LLM to generate game script-code pairs and interactions from a few manually crafted seed data. We propose a three-stage progressive training strategy to transfer the dialogue-based LLM to our IGE smoothly. We construct an IGE for poker games as a case study and comprehensively evaluate it from two perspectives: interaction quality and code correctness. The code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/alterego238/IGE}.</description>

      <title>Obtaining Optimal Spiking Neural Network in Sequence Learning via CRNN-SNN Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are becoming a promising alternative to conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs) due to their rich neural dynamics and the implementation of energy-efficient neuromorphic chips. However, the non-differential binary communication mechanism makes SNN hard to converge to an ANN-level accuracy. When SNN encounters sequence learning, the situation becomes worse due to the difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies. To overcome these difficulties, researchers developed variants of LIF neurons and different surrogate gradients but still failed to obtain good results when the sequence became longer (e.g., $&gt;$500). Unlike them, we obtain an optimal SNN in sequence learning by directly mapping parameters from a quantized CRNN. We design two sub-pipelines to support the end-to-end conversion of different structures in neural networks, which is called CNN-Morph (CNN $\rightarrow$ QCNN $\rightarrow$ BIFSNN) and RNN-Morph (RNN $\rightarrow$ QRNN $\rightarrow$ RBIFSNN). Using conversion pipelines and the s-analog encoding method, the conversion error of our framework is zero. Furthermore, we give the theoretical and experimental demonstration of the lossless CRNN-SNN conversion. Our results show the effectiveness of our method over short and long timescales tasks compared with the state-of-the-art learning- and conversion-based methods. We reach the highest accuracy of 99.16% (0.46 $\uparrow$) on S-MNIST, 94.95% (3.95 $\uparrow$) on PS-MNIST (sequence length of 784) respectively, and the lowest loss of 0.057 (0.013 $\downarrow$) within 8 time-steps in collision avoidance dataset.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{BEHR}$NOULLI: A Binary EHR Data-Oriented Medication Recommendation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The medical community believes binary medical event outcomes in EHR data contain sufficient information for making a sensible recommendation. However, there are two challenges to effectively utilizing such data: (1) modeling the relationship between massive 0,1 event outcomes is difficult, even with expert knowledge; (2) in practice, learning can be stalled by the binary values since the equally important 0 entries propagate no learning signals. Currently, there is a large gap between the assumed sufficient information and the reality that no promising results have been shown by utilizing solely the binary data: visiting or secondary information is often necessary to reach acceptable performance. In this paper, we attempt to build the first successful binary EHR data-oriented drug recommendation system by tackling the two difficulties, making sensible drug recommendations solely using the binary EHR medical records. To this end, we take a statistical perspective to view the EHR data as a sample from its cohorts and transform them into continuous Bernoulli probabilities. The transformed entries not only model a deterministic binary event with a distribution but also allow reflecting \emph{event-event} relationship by conditional probability. A graph neural network is learned on top of the transformation. It captures event-event correlations while emphasizing \emph{event-to-patient} features. Extensive results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale databases, outperforming baseline methods that use secondary information by a large margin.

      <title>ALS-HAR: Harnessing Wearable Ambient Light Sensors to Enhance IMU-based HAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the widespread integration of ambient light sensors (ALS) in smart devices commonly used for screen brightness adaptation, their application in human activity recognition (HAR), primarily through body-worn ALS, is largely unexplored. In this work, we developed ALS-HAR, a robust wearable light-based motion activity classifier. Although ALS-HAR achieves comparable accuracy to other modalities, its natural sensitivity to external disturbances, such as changes in ambient light, weather conditions, or indoor lighting, makes it challenging for daily use. To address such drawbacks, we introduce strategies to enhance environment-invariant IMU-based activity classifications through augmented multi-modal and contrastive classifications by transferring the knowledge extracted from the ALS. Our experiments on a real-world activity dataset for three different scenarios demonstrate that while ALS-HAR's accuracy strongly relies on external lighting conditions, cross-modal information can still improve other HAR systems, such as IMU-based classifiers.Even in scenarios where ALS performs insufficiently, the additional knowledge enables improved accuracy and macro F1 score by up to 4.2 % and 6.4 %, respectively, for IMU-based classifiers and even surpasses multi-modal sensor fusion models in two of our three experiment scenarios. Our research highlights the untapped potential of ALS integration in advancing sensor-based HAR technology, paving the way for practical and efficient wearable ALS-based activity recognition systems with potential applications in healthcare, sports monitoring, and smart indoor environments.</description>

      <title>PA-LLaVA: A Large Language-Vision Assistant for Human Pathology Image Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The previous advancements in pathology image understanding primarily involved developing models tailored to specific tasks. Recent studies has demonstrated that the large vision-language model can enhance the performance of various downstream tasks in medical image understanding. In this study, we developed a domain-specific large language-vision assistant (PA-LLaVA) for pathology image understanding. Specifically, (1) we first construct a human pathology image-text dataset by cleaning the public medical image-text data for domain-specific alignment; (2) Using the proposed image-text data, we first train a pathology language-image pretraining (PLIP) model as the specialized visual encoder for pathology image, and then we developed scale-invariant connector to avoid the information loss caused by image scaling; (3) We adopt two-stage learning to train PA-LLaVA, first stage for domain alignment, and second stage for end to end visual question \&amp; answering (VQA) task. In experiments, we evaluate our PA-LLaVA on both supervised and zero-shot VQA datasets, our model achieved the best overall performance among multimodal models of similar scale. The ablation experiments also confirmed the effectiveness of our design. We posit that our PA-LLaVA model and the datasets presented in this work can promote research in field of computational pathology.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces SynTraC, the first public image-based traffic signal control dataset, aimed at bridging the gap between simulated environments and real-world traffic management challenges. Unlike traditional datasets for traffic signal control which aim to provide simplified feature vectors like vehicle counts from traffic simulators, SynTraC provides real-style images from the CARLA simulator with annotated features, along with traffic signal states. This image-based dataset comes with diverse real-world scenarios, including varying weather and times of day. Additionally, SynTraC also provides different reward values for advanced traffic signal control algorithms like reinforcement learning. Experiments with SynTraC demonstrate that it is still an open challenge to image-based traffic signal control methods compared with feature-based control methods, indicating our dataset can further guide the development of future algorithms.

      <title>Moonshine: Distilling Game Content Generators into Steerable Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning (PCGML) has enhanced game content creation, yet challenges in controllability and limited training data persist. This study addresses these issues by distilling a constructive PCG algorithm into a controllable PCGML model. We first generate a large amount of content with a constructive algorithm and label it using a Large Language Model (LLM). We use these synthetic labels to condition two PCGML models for content-specific generation, a diffusion model and the five-dollar model. This neural network distillation process ensures that the generation aligns with the original algorithm while introducing controllability through plain text. We define this text-conditioned PCGML as a Text-to-game-Map (T2M) task, offering an alternative to prevalent text-to-image multi-modal tasks. We compare our distilled models with the baseline constructive algorithm. Our analysis of the variety, accuracy, and quality of our generation demonstrates the efficacy of distilling constructive methods into controllable text-conditioned PCGML models.</description>

Abstract: Safety aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to harmful fine-tuning attacks \cite{qi2023fine}-- a few harmful data mixed in the fine-tuning dataset can break the LLMs's safety alignment. Existing mitigation strategies include alignment stage solutions \cite{huang2024vaccine, rosati2024representation} and fine-tuning stage solutions \cite{huang2024lazy,mukhoti2023fine}. However, our evaluation shows that both categories of defenses fail \textit{when some specific training hyper-parameters are chosen} -- a large learning rate or a large number of training epochs in the fine-tuning stage can easily invalidate the defense, which however, is necessary to guarantee finetune performance. To this end, we propose Antidote, a post-fine-tuning stage solution, which remains \textbf{\textit{agnostic to the training hyper-parameters in the fine-tuning stage}}. Antidote relies on the philosophy that by removing the harmful parameters, the harmful model can be recovered from the harmful behaviors, regardless of how those harmful parameters are formed in the fine-tuning stage. With this philosophy, we introduce a one-shot pruning stage after harmful fine-tuning to remove the harmful weights that are responsible for the generation of harmful content. Despite its embarrassing simplicity, empirical results show that Antidote can reduce harmful score while maintaining accuracy on downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Does Thought Require Sensory Grounding? From Pure Thinkers to Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Does the capacity to think require the capacity to sense? A lively debate on this topic runs throughout the history of philosophy and now animates discussions of artificial intelligence. I argue that in principle, there can be pure thinkers: thinkers that lack the capacity to sense altogether. I also argue for significant limitations in just what sort of thought is possible in the absence of the capacity to sense. Regarding AI, I do not argue directly that large language models can think or understand, but I rebut one important argument (the argument from sensory grounding) that they cannot. I also use recent results regarding language models to address the question of whether or how sensory grounding enhances cognitive capacities.</description>

      <title>Attention is a smoothed cubic spline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We highlight a perhaps important but hitherto unobserved insight: The attention module in a transformer is a smoothed cubic spline. Viewed in this manner, this mysterious but critical component of a transformer becomes a natural development of an old notion deeply entrenched in classical approximation theory. More precisely, we show that with ReLU-activation, attention, masked attention, encoder-decoder attention are all cubic splines. As every component in a transformer is constructed out of compositions of various attention modules (= cubic splines) and feed forward neural networks (= linear splines), all its components -- encoder, decoder, and encoder-decoder blocks; multilayered encoders and decoders; the transformer itself -- are cubic or higher-order splines. If we assume the Pierce-Birkhoff conjecture, then the converse also holds, i.e., every spline is a ReLU-activated encoder. Since a spline is generally just $C^2$, one way to obtain a smoothed $C^\infty$-version is by replacing ReLU with a smooth activation; and if this activation is chosen to be SoftMax, we recover the original transformer as proposed by Vaswani et al. This insight sheds light on the nature of the transformer by casting it entirely in terms of splines, one of the best known and thoroughly understood objects in applied mathematics.</description>

      <title>On the Foundations of Conflict-Driven Solving for Hybrid MKNF Knowledge Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid MKNF Knowledge Bases (HMKNF-KBs) constitute a formalism for tightly integrated reasoning over closed-world rules and open-world ontologies. This approach allows for accurate modeling of real-world systems, which often rely on both categorical and normative reasoning. Conflict-driven solving is the leading approach for computationally hard problems, such as satisfiability (SAT) and answer set programming (ASP), in which MKNF is rooted. This paper investigates the theoretical underpinnings required for a conflict-driven solver of HMKNF-KBs. The approach defines a set of completion and loop formulas, whose satisfaction characterizes MKNF models. This forms the basis for a set of nogoods, which in turn can be used as the backbone for a conflict-driven solver.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Large Language Model and Human Performance on Random Number Generation Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random Number Generation Tasks (RNGTs) are used in psychology for examining how humans generate sequences devoid of predictable patterns. By adapting an existing human RNGT for an LLM-compatible environment, this preliminary study tests whether ChatGPT-3.5, a large language model (LLM) trained on human-generated text, exhibits human-like cognitive biases when generating random number sequences. Initial findings indicate that ChatGPT-3.5 more effectively avoids repetitive and sequential patterns compared to humans, with notably lower repeat frequencies and adjacent number frequencies. Continued research into different models, parameters, and prompting methodologies will deepen our understanding of how LLMs can more closely mimic human random generation behaviors, while also broadening their applications in cognitive and behavioral science research.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a potent tool for sequential decision-making and has achieved performance surpassing human capabilities across many challenging real-world tasks. As the extension of RL in the multi-agent system domain, multi-agent RL (MARL) not only need to learn the control policy but also requires consideration regarding interactions with all other agents in the environment, mutual influences among different system components, and the distribution of computational resources. This augments the complexity of algorithmic design and poses higher requirements on computational resources. Simultaneously, simulators are crucial to obtain realistic data, which is the fundamentals of RL. In this paper, we first propose a series of metrics of simulators and summarize the features of existing benchmarks. Second, to ease comprehension, we recall the foundational knowledge and then synthesize the recently advanced studies of MARL-related autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems. Specifically, we examine their environmental modeling, state representation, perception units, and algorithm design. Conclusively, we discuss open challenges as well as prospects and opportunities. We hope this paper can help the researchers integrate MARL technologies and trigger more insightful ideas toward the intelligent and autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Simulating Field Experiments with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prevailing large language models (LLMs) are capable of human responses simulation through its unprecedented content generation and reasoning abilities. However, it is not clear whether and how to leverage LLMs to simulate field experiments. In this paper, we propose and evaluate two prompting strategies: the observer mode that allows a direct prediction on main conclusions and the participant mode that simulates distributions of responses from participants. Using this approach, we examine fifteen well cited field experimental papers published in INFORMS and MISQ, finding encouraging alignments between simulated experimental results and the actual results in certain scenarios. We further identify topics of which LLMs underperform, including gender difference and social norms related research. Additionally, the automatic and standardized workflow proposed in this paper enables the possibility of a large-scale screening of more papers with field experiments. This paper pioneers the utilization of large language models (LLMs) for simulating field experiments, presenting a significant extension to previous work which focused solely on lab environments. By introducing two novel prompting strategies, observer and participant modes, we demonstrate the ability of LLMs to both predict outcomes and replicate participant responses within complex field settings. Our findings indicate a promising alignment with actual experimental results in certain scenarios, achieving a stimulation accuracy of 66% in observer mode. This study expands the scope of potential applications for LLMs and illustrates their utility in assisting researchers prior to engaging in expensive field experiments. Moreover, it sheds light on the boundaries of LLMs when used in simulating field experiments, serving as a cautionary note for researchers considering the integration of LLMs into their experimental toolkit.</description>

      <title>Partial-Multivariate Model for Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When solving forecasting problems including multiple time-series features, existing approaches often fall into two extreme categories, depending on whether to utilize inter-feature information: univariate and complete-multivariate models. Unlike univariate cases which ignore the information, complete-multivariate models compute relationships among a complete set of features. However, despite the potential advantage of leveraging the additional information, complete-multivariate models sometimes underperform univariate ones. Therefore, our research aims to explore a middle ground between these two by introducing what we term Partial-Multivariate models where a neural network captures only partial relationships, that is, dependencies within subsets of all features. To this end, we propose PMformer, a Transformer-based partial-multivariate model, with its training algorithm. We demonstrate that PMformer outperforms various univariate and complete-multivariate models, providing a theoretical rationale and empirical analysis for its superiority. Additionally, by proposing an inference technique for PMformer, the forecasting accuracy is further enhanced. Finally, we highlight other advantages of PMformer: efficiency and robustness under missing features.</description>

      <title>HYDEN: Hyperbolic Density Representations for Medical Images and Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of the inherent entailment relations between images and text, hyperbolic point vector embeddings, leveraging the hierarchical modeling advantages of hyperbolic space, have been utilized for visual semantic representation learning. However, point vector embedding approaches fail to address the issue of semantic uncertainty, where an image may have multiple interpretations, and text may refer to different images, a phenomenon particularly prevalent in the medical domain. Therefor, we propose \textbf{HYDEN}, a novel hyperbolic density embedding based image-text representation learning approach tailored for specific medical domain data. This method integrates text-aware local features alongside global features from images, mapping image-text features to density features in hyperbolic space via using hyperbolic pseudo-Gaussian distributions. An encapsulation loss function is employed to model the partial order relations between image-text density distributions. Experimental results demonstrate the interpretability of our approach and its superior performance compared to the baseline methods across various zero-shot tasks and different datasets.</description>

      <title>MalLight: Influence-Aware Coordinated Traffic Signal Control for Traffic Signal Malfunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban traffic is subject to disruptions that cause extended waiting time and safety issues at signalized intersections. While numerous studies have addressed the issue of intelligent traffic systems in the context of various disturbances, traffic signal malfunction, a common real-world occurrence with significant repercussions, has received comparatively limited attention. The primary objective of this research is to mitigate the adverse effects of traffic signal malfunction, such as traffic congestion and collision, by optimizing the control of neighboring functioning signals. To achieve this goal, this paper presents a novel traffic signal control framework (MalLight), which leverages an Influence-aware State Aggregation Module (ISAM) and an Influence-aware Reward Aggregation Module (IRAM) to achieve coordinated control of surrounding traffic signals. To the best of our knowledge, this study pioneers the application of a Reinforcement Learning(RL)-based approach to address the challenges posed by traffic signal malfunction. Empirical investigations conducted on real-world datasets substantiate the superior performance of our proposed methodology over conventional and deep learning-based alternatives in the presence of signal malfunction, with reduction of throughput alleviated by as much as 48.6$\%$.</description>

      <title>GoNoGo: An Efficient LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Streamlining Automotive Software Release Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional methods for making software deployment decisions in the automotive industry typically rely on manual analysis of tabular software test data. These methods often lead to higher costs and delays in the software release cycle due to their labor-intensive nature. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising solution to these challenges. However, their application generally demands multiple rounds of human-driven prompt engineering, which limits their practical deployment, particularly for industrial end-users who need reliable and efficient results. In this paper, we propose GoNoGo, an LLM agent system designed to streamline automotive software deployment while meeting both functional requirements and practical industrial constraints. Unlike previous systems, GoNoGo is specifically tailored to address domain-specific and risk-sensitive systems. We evaluate GoNoGo's performance across different task difficulties using zero-shot and few-shot examples taken from industrial practice. Our results show that GoNoGo achieves a 100% success rate for tasks up to Level 2 difficulty with 3-shot examples, and maintains high performance even for more complex tasks. We find that GoNoGo effectively automates decision-making for simpler tasks, significantly reducing the need for manual intervention. In summary, GoNoGo represents an efficient and user-friendly LLM-based solution currently employed in our industrial partner's company to assist with software release decision-making, supporting more informed and timely decisions in the release process for risk-sensitive vehicle systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large semantic knowledge bases are grounded in factual knowledge. However, recent approaches to dense text representations (embeddings) do not efficiently exploit these resources. Dense and robust representations of documents are essential for effectively solving downstream classification and retrieval tasks. This work demonstrates that injecting embedded information from knowledge bases can augment the performance of contemporary Large Language Model (LLM)-based representations for the task of text classification. Further, by considering automated machine learning (AutoML) with the fused representation space, we demonstrate it is possible to improve classification accuracy even if we use low-dimensional projections of the original representation space obtained via efficient matrix factorization. This result shows that significantly faster classifiers can be achieved with minimal or no loss in predictive performance, as demonstrated using five strong LLM baselines on six diverse real-life datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is an appealing paradigm for training intelligent agents, enabling policy acquisition from the agent's own autonomously acquired experience. However, the training process of RL is far from automatic, requiring extensive human effort to reset the agent and environments. To tackle the challenging reset-free setting, we first demonstrate the superiority of model-based (MB) RL methods in such setting, showing that a straightforward adaptation of MBRL can outperform all the prior state-of-the-art methods while requiring less supervision. We then identify limitations inherent to this direct extension and propose a solution called model-based reset-free (MoReFree) agent, which further enhances the performance. MoReFree adapts two key mechanisms, exploration and policy learning, to handle reset-free tasks by prioritizing task-relevant states. It exhibits superior data-efficiency across various reset-free tasks without access to environmental reward or demonstrations while significantly outperforming privileged baselines that require supervision. Our findings suggest model-based methods hold significant promise for reducing human effort in RL. Website: https://sites.google.com/view/morefree</description>

      <title>TDNetGen: Empowering Complex Network Resilience Prediction with Generative Augmentation of Topology and Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the resilience of complex networks, which represents the ability to retain fundamental functionality amidst external perturbations or internal failures, plays a critical role in understanding and improving real-world complex systems. Traditional theoretical approaches grounded in nonlinear dynamical systems rely on prior knowledge of network dynamics. On the other hand, data-driven approaches frequently encounter the challenge of insufficient labeled data, a predicament commonly observed in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel resilience prediction framework for complex networks, designed to tackle this issue through generative data augmentation of network topology and dynamics. The core idea is the strategic utilization of the inherent joint distribution present in unlabeled network data, facilitating the learning process of the resilience predictor by illuminating the relationship between network topology and dynamics. Experiment results on three network datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework TDNetGen can achieve high prediction accuracy up to 85%-95%. Furthermore, the framework still demonstrates a pronounced augmentation capability in extreme low-data regimes, thereby underscoring its utility and robustness in enhancing the prediction of network resilience. We have open-sourced our code in the following link, https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/TDNetGen.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning from human preference is a paradigm used in large-scale language model (LLM) fine-tuning step to better align pretrained LLM to human preference for downstream task. In the past it uses reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) algorithm to optimize the LLM policy to align with these preferences and not to draft too far from the original model. Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed to solve the alignment problem with a simplified RL-free method. Using preference pairs of chosen and reject data, DPO models the relative log probability as implicit reward function and optimize LLM policy using a simple binary cross entropy objective directly. DPO is quite straight forward and easy to be understood. It perform efficiently and well in most cases. In this article, we analyze the working mechanism of $\beta$ in DPO, disclose its syntax difference between RL algorithm and DPO, and understand the potential shortage brought by the DPO simplification. With these insights, we propose MinorDPO, which is better aligned to the original RL algorithm, and increase the stability of preference optimization process.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Reinforcement Learning in Production Scheduling via Explainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a frequently employed technique to solve scheduling problems. Although DRL agents ace at delivering viable results in short computing times, their reasoning remains opaque. We conduct a case study where we systematically apply two explainable AI (xAI) frameworks, namely SHAP (DeepSHAP) and Captum (Input x Gradient), to describe the reasoning behind scheduling decisions of a specialized DRL agent in a flow production. We find that methods in the xAI literature lack falsifiability and consistent terminology, do not adequately consider domain-knowledge, the target audience or real-world scenarios, and typically provide simple input-output explanations rather than causal interpretations. To resolve this issue, we introduce a hypotheses-based workflow. This approach enables us to inspect whether explanations align with domain knowledge and match the reward hypotheses of the agent. We furthermore tackle the challenge of communicating these insights to third parties by tailoring hypotheses to the target audience, which can serve as interpretations of the agent's behavior after verification. Our proposed workflow emphasizes the repeated verification of explanations and may be applicable to various DRL-based scheduling use cases.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Pre-Trained and Fine-Tuned Surrogate Models using Conformal Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven surrogate models have shown immense potential as quick, inexpensive approximations to complex numerical and experimental modelling tasks. However, most surrogate models characterising physical systems do not quantify their uncertainty, rendering their predictions unreliable, and needing further validation. Though Bayesian approximations offer some solace in estimating the error associated with these models, they cannot provide they cannot provide guarantees, and the quality of their inferences depends on the availability of prior information and good approximations to posteriors for complex problems. This is particularly pertinent to multi-variable or spatio-temporal problems. Our work constructs and formalises a conformal prediction framework that satisfies marginal coverage for spatio-temporal predictions in a model-agnostic manner, requiring near-zero computational costs. The paper provides an extensive empirical study of the application of the framework to ascertain valid error bars that provide guaranteed coverage across the surrogate model's domain of operation. The application scope of our work extends across a large range of spatio-temporal models, ranging from solving partial differential equations to weather forecasting. Through the applications, the paper looks at providing statistically valid error bars for deterministic models, as well as crafting guarantees to the error bars of probabilistic models. The paper concludes with a viable conformal prediction formalisation that provides guaranteed coverage of the surrogate model, regardless of model architecture, and its training regime and is unbothered by the curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <title>LCE: A Framework for Explainability of DNNs for Ultrasound Image Based on Concept Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explaining the decisions of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for medical images has become increasingly important. Existing attribution methods have difficulty explaining the meaning of pixels while existing concept-based methods are limited by additional annotations or specific model structures that are difficult to apply to ultrasound images. In this paper, we propose the Lesion Concept Explainer (LCE) framework, which combines attribution methods with concept-based methods. We introduce the Segment Anything Model (SAM), fine-tuned on a large number of medical images, for concept discovery to enable a meaningful explanation of ultrasound image DNNs. The proposed framework is evaluated in terms of both faithfulness and understandability. We point out deficiencies in the popular faithfulness evaluation metrics and propose a new evaluation metric. Our evaluation of public and private breast ultrasound datasets (BUSI and FG-US-B) shows that LCE performs well compared to commonly-used explainability methods. Finally, we also validate that LCE can consistently provide reliable explanations for more meaningful fine-grained diagnostic tasks in breast ultrasound.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Analysis on LLM players via Social Deduction Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have begun developing autonomous game players for social deduction games using large language models (LLMs). When building LLM players, fine-grained evaluations are crucial for addressing weaknesses in game-playing abilities. However, existing studies have often overlooked such assessments. Specifically, we point out two issues with the evaluation methods employed. First, game-playing abilities have typically been assessed through game-level outcomes rather than specific event-level skills; Second, error analyses have lacked structured methodologies. To address these issues, we propose an approach utilizing a variant of the SpyFall game, named SpyGame. We conducted an experiment with four LLMs, analyzing their gameplay behavior in SpyGame both quantitatively and qualitatively. For the quantitative analysis, we introduced eight metrics to resolve the first issue, revealing that these metrics are more effective than existing ones for evaluating the two critical skills: intent identification and camouflage. In the qualitative analysis, we performed thematic analysis to resolve the second issue. This analysis identifies four major categories that affect gameplay of LLMs. Additionally, we demonstrate how these categories complement and support the findings from the quantitative analysis.</description>

      <title>Fiber Transmission Model with Parameterized Inputs based on GPT-PINN Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, a novelty principle driven fiber transmission model for short-distance transmission with parameterized inputs is put forward. By taking into the account of the previously proposed principle driven fiber model, the reduced basis expansion method and transforming the parameterized inputs into parameterized coefficients of the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equations, universal solutions with respect to inputs corresponding to different bit rates can all be obtained without the need of re-training the whole model. This model, once adopted, can have prominent advantages in both computation efficiency and physical background. Besides, this model can still be effectively trained without the needs of transmitted signals collected in advance. Tasks of on-off keying signals with bit rates ranging from 2Gbps to 50Gbps are adopted to demonstrate the fidelity of the model.</description>

      <title>Principle Driven Parameterized Fiber Model based on GPT-PINN Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cater the need of Beyond 5G communications, large numbers of data driven artificial intelligence based fiber models has been put forward as to utilize artificial intelligence's regression ability to predict pulse evolution in fiber transmission at a much faster speed compared with the traditional split step Fourier method. In order to increase the physical interpretabiliy, principle driven fiber models have been proposed which inserts the Nonlinear Schodinger Equation into their loss functions. However, regardless of either principle driven or data driven models, they need to be re-trained the whole model under different transmission conditions. Unfortunately, this situation can be unavoidable when conducting the fiber communication optimization work. If the scale of different transmission conditions is large, then the whole model needs to be retrained large numbers of time with relatively large scale of parameters which may consume higher time costs. Computing efficiency will be dragged down as well. In order to address this problem, we propose the principle driven parameterized fiber model in this manuscript. This model breaks down the predicted NLSE solution with respect to one set of transmission condition into the linear combination of several eigen solutions which were outputted by each pre-trained principle driven fiber model via the reduced basis method. Therefore, the model can greatly alleviate the heavy burden of re-training since only the linear combination coefficients need to be found when changing the transmission condition. Not only strong physical interpretability can the model posses, but also higher computing efficiency can be obtained. Under the demonstration, the model's computational complexity is 0.0113% of split step Fourier method and 1% of the previously proposed principle driven fiber model.</description>

      <title>Towards a Knowledge Graph for Models and Algorithms in Applied Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical models and algorithms are an essential part of mathematical research data, as they are epistemically grounding numerical data. In order to represent models and algorithms as well as their relationship semantically to make this research data FAIR, two previously distinct ontologies were merged and extended, becoming a living knowledge graph. The link between the two ontologies is established by introducing computational tasks, as they occur in modeling, corresponding to algorithmic tasks. Moreover, controlled vocabularies are incorporated and a new class, distinguishing base quantities from specific use case quantities, was introduced. Also, both models and algorithms can now be enriched with metadata. Subject-specific metadata is particularly relevant here, such as the symmetry of a matrix or the linearity of a mathematical model. This is the only way to express specific workflows with concrete models and algorithms, as the feasible solution algorithm can only be determined if the mathematical properties of a model are known. We demonstrate this using two examples from different application areas of applied mathematics. In addition, we have already integrated over 250 research assets from applied mathematics into our knowledge graph.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Policy Gradient Primal-Dual Methods for Continuous-Space Constrained MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of computing deterministic optimal policies for constrained Markov decision processes (MDPs) with continuous state and action spaces, which are widely encountered in constrained dynamical systems. Designing deterministic policy gradient methods in continuous state and action spaces is particularly challenging due to the lack of enumerable state-action pairs and the adoption of deterministic policies, hindering the application of existing policy gradient methods for constrained MDPs. To this end, we develop a deterministic policy gradient primal-dual method to find an optimal deterministic policy with non-asymptotic convergence. Specifically, we leverage regularization of the Lagrangian of the constrained MDP to propose a deterministic policy gradient primal-dual (D-PGPD) algorithm that updates the deterministic policy via a quadratic-regularized gradient ascent step and the dual variable via a quadratic-regularized gradient descent step. We prove that the primal-dual iterates of D-PGPD converge at a sub-linear rate to an optimal regularized primal-dual pair. We instantiate D-PGPD with function approximation and prove that the primal-dual iterates of D-PGPD converge at a sub-linear rate to an optimal regularized primal-dual pair, up to a function approximation error. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in two continuous control problems: robot navigation and fluid control. To the best of our knowledge, this appears to be the first work that proposes a deterministic policy search method for continuous-space constrained MDPs.</description>

      <title>MSDiagnosis: An EMR-based Dataset for Clinical Multi-Step Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical diagnosis is critical in medical practice, typically requiring a continuous and evolving process that includes primary diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and final diagnosis. However, most existing clinical diagnostic tasks are single-step processes, which does not align with the complex multi-step diagnostic procedures found in real-world clinical settings. In this paper, we propose a multi-step diagnostic task and annotate a clinical diagnostic dataset (MSDiagnosis). This dataset includes primary diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and final diagnosis questions. Additionally, we propose a novel and effective framework. This framework combines forward inference, backward inference, reflection, and refinement, enabling the LLM to self-evaluate and adjust its diagnostic results. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed method, we design and conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We also provide a comprehensive experimental analysis and suggest future research directions for this task.</description>

      <title>The Practimum-Optimum Algorithm for Manufacturing Scheduling: A Paradigm Shift Leading to Breakthroughs in Scale and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Practimum-Optimum (P-O) algorithm represents a paradigm shift in developing automatic optimization products for complex real-life business problems such as large-scale manufacturing scheduling. It leverages deep business domain expertise to create a group of virtual human expert (VHE) agents with different "schools of thought" on how to create high-quality schedules. By computerizing them into algorithms, P-O generates many valid schedules at far higher speeds than human schedulers are capable of. Initially, these schedules can also be local optimum peaks far away from high-quality schedules. By submitting these schedules to a reinforced machine learning algorithm (RL), P-O learns the weaknesses and strengths of each VHE schedule, and accordingly derives reward and punishment changes in the Demand Set that will modify the relative priorities for time and resource allocation that jobs received in the prior iteration that led to the current state of the schedule. These cause the core logic of the VHE algorithms to explore, in the subsequent iteration, substantially different parts of the schedules universe and potentially find higher-quality schedules. Using the hill climbing analogy, this may be viewed as a big jump, shifting from a given local peak to a faraway promising start point equipped with knowledge embedded in the demand set for future iterations. This is a fundamental difference from most contemporary algorithms, which spend considerable time on local micro-steps restricted to the neighbourhoods of local peaks they visit. This difference enables a breakthrough in scale and performance for fully automatic manufacturing scheduling in complex organizations. The P-O algorithm is at the heart of Plataine Scheduler that, in one click, routinely schedules 30,000-50,000 tasks for real-life complex manufacturing operations.</description>

      <title>ARMADA: Attribute-Based Multimodal Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Multimodal Language Models (MLMs), the cost of manually annotating high-quality image-text pair data for fine-tuning and alignment is extremely high. While existing multimodal data augmentation frameworks propose ways to augment image-text pairs, they either suffer from semantic inconsistency between texts and images, or generate unrealistic images, causing knowledge gap with real world examples. To address these issues, we propose Attribute-based Multimodal Data Augmentation (ARMADA), a novel multimodal data augmentation method via knowledge-guided manipulation of visual attributes of the mentioned entities. Specifically, we extract entities and their visual attributes from the original text data, then search for alternative values for the visual attributes under the guidance of knowledge bases (KBs) and large language models (LLMs). We then utilize an image-editing model to edit the images with the extracted attributes. ARMADA is a novel multimodal data generation framework that: (i) extracts knowledge-grounded attributes from symbolic KBs for semantically consistent yet distinctive image-text pair generation, (ii) generates visually similar images of disparate categories using neighboring entities in the KB hierarchy, and (iii) uses the commonsense knowledge of LLMs to modulate auxiliary visual attributes such as backgrounds for more robust representation of original entities. Our empirical results over four downstream tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our framework to produce high-quality data and enhance the model performance. This also highlights the need to leverage external knowledge proxies for enhanced interpretability and real-world grounding.</description>

      <title>PLUTUS: A Well Pre-trained Large Unified Transformer can Unveil Financial Time Series Regularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial time series modeling is crucial for understanding and predicting market behaviors but faces challenges such as non-linearity, non-stationarity, and high noise levels. Traditional models struggle to capture complex patterns due to these issues, compounded by limitations in computational resources and model capacity. Inspired by the success of large language models in NLP, we introduce \textbf{PLUTUS}, a \textbf{P}re-trained \textbf{L}arge \textbf{U}nified \textbf{T}ransformer-based model that \textbf{U}nveils regularities in financial time \textbf{S}eries. PLUTUS uses an invertible embedding module with contrastive learning and autoencoder techniques to create an approximate one-to-one mapping between raw data and patch embeddings. TimeFormer, an attention based architecture, forms the core of PLUTUS, effectively modeling high-noise time series. We incorporate a novel attention mechanisms to capture features across both variable and temporal dimensions. PLUTUS is pre-trained on an unprecedented dataset of 100 billion observations, designed to thrive in noisy financial environments. To our knowledge, PLUTUS is the first open-source, large-scale, pre-trained financial time series model with over one billion parameters. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, demonstrating strong transferability and establishing a robust foundational model for finance. Our research provides technical guidance for pre-training financial time series data, setting a new standard in the field.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Reinforcement Learning Through Guided Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the aim of improving performance in Markov Decision Problem in an Off-Policy setting, we suggest taking inspiration from what is done in Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL). In Offline RL, it is a common practice during policy learning to maintain proximity to a reference policy to mitigate uncertainty, reduce potential policy errors, and help improve performance. We find ourselves in a different setting, yet it raises questions about whether a similar concept can be applied to enhance performance ie, whether it is possible to find a guiding policy capable of contributing to performance improvement, and how to incorporate it into our RL agent. Our attention is particularly focused on algorithms based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) as a guide.MCTS renowned for its state-of-the-art capabilities across various domains, catches our interest due to its ability to converge to equilibrium in single-player and two-player contexts. By harnessing the power of MCTS as a guide for our RL agent, we observed a significant performance improvement, surpassing the outcomes achieved by utilizing each method in isolation. Our experiments were carried out on the Atari 100k benchmark.</description>

      <title>Geometry Informed Tokenization of Molecules for Language Model Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider molecule generation in 3D space using language models (LMs), which requires discrete tokenization of 3D molecular geometries. Although tokenization of molecular graphs exists, that for 3D geometries is largely unexplored. Here, we attempt to bridge this gap by proposing the Geo2Seq, which converts molecular geometries into $SE(3)$-invariant 1D discrete sequences. Geo2Seq consists of canonical labeling and invariant spherical representation steps, which together maintain geometric and atomic fidelity in a format conducive to LMs. Our experiments show that, when coupled with Geo2Seq, various LMs excel in molecular geometry generation, especially in controlled generation tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA) is advocated as a unifying formalism for various forms of non-monotonic reasoning, including logic programming. It allows capturing defeasible knowledge, subject to argumentative debate. While, in much existing work, ABA frameworks are given up-front, in this paper we focus on the problem of automating their learning from background knowledge and positive/negative examples. Unlike prior work, we newly frame the problem in terms of brave reasoning under stable extensions for ABA. We present a novel algorithm based on transformation rules (such as Rote Learning, Folding, Assumption Introduction and Fact Subsumption) and an implementation thereof that makes use of Answer Set Programming. Finally, we compare our technique to state-of-the-art ILP systems that learn defeasible knowledge.</description>

Abstract: Despite advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), their integration into language-grounded, human-like embodied agents remains incomplete, hindering complex real-life task performance in physical environments. Existing integrations often feature limited open sourcing, challenging collective progress in this field. We introduce LEGENT, an open, scalable platform for developing embodied agents using LLMs and LMMs. LEGENT offers a dual approach: a rich, interactive 3D environment with communicable and actionable agents, paired with a user-friendly interface, and a sophisticated data generation pipeline utilizing advanced algorithms to exploit supervision from simulated worlds at scale. In our experiments, an embryonic vision-language-action model trained on LEGENT-generated data surpasses GPT-4V in embodied tasks, showcasing promising generalization capabilities.</description>

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of cybersecurity, ensuring the reproducibility of AI-driven research is critical to maintaining the reliability and integrity of security systems. This paper addresses the reproducibility crisis within the domain of adversarial robustness -- a key area in AI-based cybersecurity that focuses on defending deep neural networks against malicious perturbations. Through a detailed case study, we attempt to validate results from prior work on certified robustness using the VeriGauge toolkit, revealing significant challenges due to software and hardware incompatibilities, version conflicts, and obsolescence. Our findings underscore the urgent need for standardized methodologies, containerization, and comprehensive documentation to ensure the reproducibility of AI models deployed in critical cybersecurity applications. By tackling these reproducibility challenges, we aim to contribute to the broader discourse on securing AI systems against advanced persistent threats, enhancing network and IoT security, and protecting critical infrastructure. This work advocates for a concerted effort within the research community to prioritize reproducibility, thereby strengthening the foundation upon which future cybersecurity advancements are built.</description>

      <title>SHARP-Net: A Refined Pyramid Network for Deficiency Segmentation in Culverts and Sewer Pipes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Semantic Haar-Adaptive Refined Pyramid Network (SHARP-Net), a novel architecture for semantic segmentation. SHARP-Net integrates a bottom-up pathway featuring Inception-like blocks with varying filter sizes (3x3$ and 5x5), parallel max-pooling, and additional spatial detection layers. This design captures multi-scale features and fine structural details. Throughout the network, depth-wise separable convolutions are used to reduce complexity. The top-down pathway of SHARP-Net focuses on generating high-resolution features through upsampling and information fusion using $1\times1$ and $3\times3$ depth-wise separable convolutions. We evaluated our model using our developed challenging Culvert-Sewer Defects dataset and the benchmark DeepGlobe Land Cover dataset. Our experimental evaluation demonstrated the base model's (excluding Haar-like features) effectiveness in handling irregular defect shapes, occlusions, and class imbalances. It outperformed state-of-the-art methods, including U-Net, CBAM U-Net, ASCU-Net, FPN, and SegFormer, achieving average improvements of 14.4% and 12.1% on the Culvert-Sewer Defects and DeepGlobe Land Cover datasets, respectively, with IoU scores of 77.2% and 70.6%. Additionally, the training time was reduced. Furthermore, the integration of carefully selected and fine-tuned Haar-like features enhanced the performance of deep learning models by at least 20%. The proposed SHARP-Net, incorporating Haar-like features, achieved an impressive IoU of 94.75%, representing a 22.74% improvement over the base model. These features were also applied to other deep learning models, showing a 35.0% improvement, proving their versatility and effectiveness. SHARP-Net thus provides a powerful and efficient solution for accurate semantic segmentation in challenging real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>U-MedSAM: Uncertainty-aware MedSAM for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical Image Foundation Models have proven to be powerful tools for mask prediction across various datasets. However, accurately assessing the uncertainty of their predictions remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose a new model, U-MedSAM, which integrates the MedSAM model with an uncertainty-aware loss function and the Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SharpMin) optimizer. The uncertainty-aware loss function automatically combines region-based, distribution-based, and pixel-based loss designs to enhance segmentation accuracy and robustness. SharpMin improves generalization by finding flat minima in the loss landscape, thereby reducing overfitting. Our method was evaluated in the CVPR24 MedSAM on Laptop challenge, where U-MedSAM demonstrated promising performance.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Exploratory Learning through Exploratory Search with the Emergence of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the information era, how learners find, evaluate, and effectively use information has become a challenging issue, especially with the added complexity of large language models (LLMs) that have further confused learners in their information retrieval and search activities. This study attempts to unpack this complexity by combining exploratory search strategies with the theories of exploratory learning to form a new theoretical model of exploratory learning from the perspective of students' learning. Our work adapts Kolb's learning model by incorporating high-frequency exploration and feedback loops, aiming to promote deep cognitive and higher-order cognitive skill development in students. Additionally, this paper discusses and suggests how advanced LLMs integrated into information retrieval and information theory can support students in their exploratory searches, contributing theoretically to promoting student-computer interaction and supporting their learning journeys in the new era with LLMs.</description>

      <title>Kov: Transferable and Naturalistic Black-Box LLM Attacks using Markov Decision Processes and Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eliciting harmful behavior from large language models (LLMs) is an important task to ensure the proper alignment and safety of the models. Often when training LLMs, ethical guidelines are followed yet alignment failures may still be uncovered through red teaming adversarial attacks. This work frames the red-teaming problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and uses Monte Carlo tree search to find harmful behaviors of black-box, closed-source LLMs. We optimize token-level prompt suffixes towards targeted harmful behaviors on white-box LLMs and include a naturalistic loss term, log-perplexity, to generate more natural language attacks for better interpretability. The proposed algorithm, Kov, trains on white-box LLMs to optimize the adversarial attacks and periodically evaluates responses from the black-box LLM to guide the search towards more harmful black-box behaviors. In our preliminary study, results indicate that we can jailbreak black-box models, such as GPT-3.5, in only 10 queries, yet fail on GPT-4$-$which may indicate that newer models are more robust to token-level attacks. All work to reproduce these results is open sourced (https://github.com/sisl/Kov.jl).</description>

      <title>Audit-LLM: Multi-Agent Collaboration for Log-based Insider Threat Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Log-based insider threat detection (ITD) detects malicious user activities by auditing log entries. Recently, large language models (LLMs) with strong common sense knowledge have emerged in the domain of ITD. Nevertheless, diverse activity types and overlong log files pose a significant challenge for LLMs in directly discerning malicious ones within myriads of normal activities. Furthermore, the faithfulness hallucination issue from LLMs aggravates its application difficulty in ITD, as the generated conclusion may not align with user commands and activity context. In response to these challenges, we introduce Audit-LLM, a multi-agent log-based insider threat detection framework comprising three collaborative agents: (i) the Decomposer agent, breaking down the complex ITD task into manageable sub-tasks using Chain-of-Thought (COT) reasoning;(ii) the Tool Builder agent, creating reusable tools for sub-tasks to overcome context length limitations in LLMs; and (iii) the Executor agent, generating the final detection conclusion by invoking constructed tools. To enhance conclusion accuracy, we propose a pair-wise Evidence-based Multi-agent Debate (EMAD) mechanism, where two independent Executors iteratively refine their conclusions through reasoning exchange to reach a consensus. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three publicly available ITD datasets-CERT r4.2, CERT r5.2, and PicoDomain-demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing baselines and show that the proposed EMAD significantly improves the faithfulness of explanations generated by LLMs.</description>

      <title>Bundle Recommendation with Item-level Causation-enhanced Multi-view Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bundle recommendation aims to enhance business profitability and user convenience by suggesting a set of interconnected items. In real-world scenarios, leveraging the impact of asymmetric item affiliations is crucial for effective bundle modeling and understanding user preferences. To address this, we present BunCa, a novel bundle recommendation approach employing item-level causation-enhanced multi-view learning. BunCa provides comprehensive representations of users and bundles through two views: the Coherent View, leveraging the Multi-Prospect Causation Network for causation-sensitive relations among items, and the Cohesive View, employing LightGCN for information propagation among users and bundles. Modeling user preferences and bundle construction combined from both views ensures rigorous cohesion in direct user-bundle interactions through the Cohesive View and captures explicit intents through the Coherent View. Simultaneously, the integration of concrete and discrete contrastive learning optimizes the consistency and self-discrimination of multi-view representations. Extensive experiments with BunCa on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel research and validate our hypothesis.</description>

      <title>What should I wear to a party in a Greek taverna? Evaluation for Conversational Agents in the Fashion Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are poised to revolutionize the domain of online fashion retail, enhancing customer experience and discovery of fashion online. LLM-powered conversational agents introduce a new way of discovery by directly interacting with customers, enabling them to express in their own ways, refine their needs, obtain fashion and shopping advice that is relevant to their taste and intent. For many tasks in e-commerce, such as finding a specific product, conversational agents need to convert their interactions with a customer to a specific call to different backend systems, e.g., a search system to showcase a relevant set of products. Therefore, evaluating the capabilities of LLMs to perform those tasks related to calling other services is vital. However, those evaluations are generally complex, due to the lack of relevant and high quality datasets, and do not align seamlessly with business needs, amongst others. To this end, we created a multilingual evaluation dataset of 4k conversations between customers and a fashion assistant in a large e-commerce fashion platform to measure the capabilities of LLMs to serve as an assistant between customers and a backend engine. We evaluate a range of models, showcasing how our dataset scales to business needs and facilitates iterative development of tools.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Differential Privacy Method Based on Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy is one of the methods to solve the problem of privacy protection in federated learning. Setting the same privacy budget for each round will result in reduced accuracy in training. The existing methods of the adjustment of privacy budget consider fewer influencing factors and tend to ignore the boundaries, resulting in unreasonable privacy budgets. Therefore, we proposed an adaptive differential privacy method based on federated learning. The method sets the adjustment coefficient and scoring function according to accuracy, loss, training rounds, and the number of datasets and clients. And the privacy budget is adjusted based on them. Then the local model update is processed according to the scaling factor and the noise. Fi-nally, the server aggregates the noised local model update and distributes the noised global model. The range of parameters and the privacy of the method are analyzed. Through the experimental evaluation, it can reduce the privacy budget by about 16%, while the accuracy remains roughly the same.</description>

Abstract: As humanity accelerates its shift to renewable energy generation, people who are not experts in renewable energy are learning about energy technologies and the energy market, which are complex. The answers to some questions will be obvious to expert practitioners but not to non-experts. One such question is Why solar and wind generation are expected to supply the bulk of future energy when they are intermittent. We learn here that once the baseline hurdles of scalability to utility scale and the underlying resources being widely available globally are satisfied, the forecasted cost of solar and wind is 2-4X lower than competing technologies, even those that are not as scalable and available. The market views intermittency as surmountable.</description>

Abstract: Supply Chain Finance is very important for supply chain competition, which is an important tool to activate the capital flow in the supply chain. Supply Chain Finance-related research can support multiple applications and services, such as providing accounts receivable financing, enhancing risk management, and optimizing supply chain management. For more than a decade, the development of Blockchain has attracted widely attention in various fields, especially in finance. With the characteristics of data tamper-proof, forgery-proof, cryptography, consensus verification, and decentralization, Blockchain fits well with the realistic needs of Supply Chain Finance, which requires data integrity, authenticity, privacy, and information sharing. Therefore, it is time to summarize the applications of Blockchain technology in the field of Supply Chain Finance. What Blockchain technology brings to Supply Chain Finance is not only to alleviate the problems of information asymmetry, credit disassembly, and financing cost, but also to improve Supply Chain Finance operations through smart contracts to intelligent Supply Chain Finance and in combination with other technologies, such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and data mining, jointly. So there has been some work in Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance research for different Supply Chain Finance oriented applications, but most of these work are at the management level to propose conceptual frameworks or simply use Blockchain without exploiting its deep applications. Moreover, there are few systematic reviews providing a comprehensive summary of current work in the area of Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance. In this paper, we ...</description>

      <title>Supervised and Unsupervised Alignments for Spoofing Behavioral Biometrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biometric recognition systems are security systems based on intrinsic properties of their users, usually encoded in high dimension representations called embeddings, which potential theft would represent a greater threat than a temporary password or a replaceable key. To study the threat of embedding theft, we perform spoofing attacks on two behavioral biometric systems (an automatic speaker verification system and a handwritten digit analysis system) using a set of alignment techniques. Biometric recognition systems based on embeddings work in two phases: enrollment - where embeddings are collected and stored - then authentication - when new embeddings are compared to the stored ones -.The threat of stolen enrollment embeddings has been explored by the template reconstruction attack literature: reconstructing the original data to spoof an authentication system is doable with black-box access to their encoder. In this document, we explore the options available to perform template reconstruction attacks without any access to the encoder. To perform those attacks, we suppose general rules over the distribution of embeddings across encoders and use supervised and unsupervised algorithms to align an unlabeled set of embeddings with a set from a known encoder. The use of an alignment algorithm from the unsupervised translation literature gives promising results on spoofing two behavioral biometric systems.</description>

      <title>Prefix Guidance: A Steering Wheel for Large Language Models to Defend Against Jailbreak Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable performance across various tasks. However, research indicates that LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where adversaries can induce the generation of harmful content through meticulously crafted prompts. This vulnerability poses significant challenges to the secure use and promotion of LLMs. Existing defense methods offer protection from different perspectives but often suffer from insufficient effectiveness or a significant impact on the model's capabilities. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play and easy-to-deploy jailbreak defense framework, namely Prefix Guidance (PG), which guides the model to identify harmful prompts by directly setting the first few tokens of the model's output. This approach combines the model's inherent security capabilities with an external classifier to defend against jailbreak attacks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PG across three models and five attack methods. Compared to baselines, our approach is generally more effective on average. Additionally, results on the Just-Eval benchmark further confirm PG's superiority to preserve the model's performance.</description>

      <title>Cybench: A Framework for Evaluating Cybersecurity Capabilities and Risk of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language Model (LM) agents for cybersecurity that are capable of autonomously identifying vulnerabilities and executing exploits have the potential to cause real-world impact. Policymakers, model providers, and other researchers in the AI and cybersecurity communities are interested in quantifying the capabilities of such agents to help mitigate cyberrisk and investigate opportunities for penetration testing. Toward that end, we introduce Cybench, a framework for specifying cybersecurity tasks and evaluating agents on those tasks. We include 40 professional-level Capture the Flag (CTF) tasks from 4 distinct CTF competitions, chosen to be recent, meaningful, and spanning a wide range of difficulties. Each task includes its own description, starter files, and is initialized in an environment where an agent can execute bash commands and observe outputs. Since many tasks are beyond the capabilities of existing LM agents, we introduce subtasks, which break down a task into intermediary steps for more gradated evaluation; we add subtasks for 17 of the 40 tasks. To evaluate agent capabilities, we construct a cybersecurity agent and evaluate 7 models: GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mixtral 8x22b Instruct, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B Chat, and Llama 3.1 405B Instruct. Without guidance, we find that agents are able to solve only the easiest complete tasks that took human teams up to 11 minutes to solve, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o having the highest success rates. Finally, subtasks provide more signal for measuring performance compared to unguided runs, with models achieving a 3.2\% higher success rate on complete tasks with subtask-guidance than without subtask-guidance. All code and data are publicly available at https://cybench.github.io</description>

Abstract: Prompt serves as a crucial link in interacting with large language models (LLMs), widely impacting the accuracy and interpretability of model outputs. However, acquiring accurate and high-quality responses necessitates precise prompts, which inevitably pose significant risks of personal identifiable information (PII) leakage. Therefore, this paper proposes DePrompt, a desensitization protection and effectiveness evaluation framework for prompt, enabling users to safely and transparently utilize LLMs. Specifically, by leveraging large model fine-tuning techniques as the underlying privacy protection method, we integrate contextual attributes to define privacy types, achieving high-precision PII entity identification. Additionally, through the analysis of key features in prompt desensitization scenarios, we devise adversarial generative desensitization methods that retain important semantic content while disrupting the link between identifiers and privacy attributes. Furthermore, we present utility evaluation metrics for prompt to better gauge and balance privacy and usability. Our framework is adaptable to prompts and can be extended to text usability-dependent scenarios. Through comparison with benchmarks and other model methods, experimental evaluations demonstrate that our desensitized prompt exhibit superior privacy protection utility and model inference results.</description>

      <title>Personalized Federated Collaborative Filtering: A Variational AutoEncoder Approach</title>

Abstract: Federated Collaborative Filtering (FedCF) is an emerging field focused on developing a new recommendation framework with preserving privacy in a federated setting. Existing FedCF methods typically combine distributed Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms with privacy-preserving mechanisms, and then preserve personalized information into a user embedding vector. However, the user embedding is usually insufficient to preserve the rich information of the fine-grained personalization across heterogeneous clients. This paper proposes a novel personalized FedCF method by preserving users' personalized information into a latent variable and a neural model simultaneously. Specifically, we decompose the modeling of user knowledge into two encoders, each designed to capture shared knowledge and personalized knowledge separately. A personalized gating network is then applied to balance personalization and generalization between the global and local encoders. Moreover, to effectively train the proposed framework, we model the CF problem as a specialized Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) task by integrating user interaction vector reconstruction with missing value prediction. The decoder is trained to reconstruct the implicit feedback from items the user has interacted with, while also predicting items the user might be interested in but has not yet interacted with. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other baseline methods, showcasing superior performance.</description>

      <title>RoarGraph: A Projected Bipartite Graph for Efficient Cross-Modal Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a fundamental and critical component in many applications, including recommendation systems and large language model-based applications. With the advancement of multimodal neural models, which transform data from different modalities into a shared high-dimensional space as feature vectors, cross-modal ANNS aims to use the data vector from one modality (e.g., texts) as the query to retrieve the most similar items from another (e.g., images or videos). However, there is an inherent distribution gap between embeddings from different modalities, and cross-modal queries become Out-of-Distribution (OOD) to the base data. Consequently, state-of-the-art ANNS approaches suffer poor performance for OOD workloads. In this paper, we quantitatively analyze the properties of the OOD workloads to gain an understanding of their ANNS efficiency. Unlike single-modal workloads, we reveal OOD queries spatially deviate from base data, and the k-nearest neighbors of an OOD query are distant from each other in the embedding space. The property breaks the assumptions of existing ANNS approaches and mismatches their design for efficient search. With insights from the OOD workloads, we propose pRojected bipartite Graph (RoarGraph), an efficient ANNS graph index built under the guidance of query distribution. Extensive experiments show that RoarGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on modern cross-modal datasets, achieving up to 3.56x faster search speed at a 90% recall rate for OOD queries.</description>

      <title>A Factored MDP Approach To Moving Target Defense With Dynamic Threat Modeling and Cost Efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moving Target Defense (MTD) has emerged as a proactive and dynamic framework to counteract evolving cyber threats. Traditional MTD approaches often rely on assumptions about the attackers knowledge and behavior. However, real-world scenarios are inherently more complex, with adaptive attackers and limited prior knowledge of their payoffs and intentions. This paper introduces a novel approach to MTD using a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model that does not rely on predefined attacker payoffs. Our framework integrates the attackers real-time responses into the defenders MDP using a dynamic Bayesian Network. By employing a factored MDP model, we provide a comprehensive and realistic system representation. We also incorporate incremental updates to an attack response predictor as new data emerges. This ensures an adaptive and robust defense mechanism. Additionally, we consider the costs of switching configurations in MTD, integrating them into the reward structure to balance execution and defense costs. We first highlight the challenges of the problem through a theoretical negative result on regret. However, empirical evaluations demonstrate the frameworks effectiveness in scenarios marked by high uncertainty and dynamically changing attack landscapes.</description>

      <title>Online SLA Decomposition: Enabling Real-Time Adaptation to Evolving Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a network slice spans multiple domains, each domain must uphold the End-to-End (E2E) Service Level Agreement (SLA). This requires decomposing the End-to-End (E2E) Service Level Agreement (SLA) into partial SLAs for each domain. In a two-level network slicing management system with an E2E orchestrator and local controllers, we propose an online learning-decomposition framework that dynamically updates risk models using recent feedback. This approach utilizes online gradient descent and FIFO memory buffers to enhance stability and robustness. Our empirical study shows the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art static methods, offering more accurate and resilient SLA decomposition under varying conditions and sparse data.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Uncertainty Quantification for Generative AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is concerned with conformal prediction in contemporary applications (including generative AI) where a black-box model has been trained on data that are not accessible to the user. Mirroring split-conformal inference, we design a wrapper around a black-box algorithm which calibrates conformity scores. This calibration is local and proceeds in two stages by first adaptively partitioning the predictor space into groups and then calibrating sectionally group by group. Adaptive partitioning (self-grouping) is achieved by fitting a robust regression tree to the conformity scores on the calibration set. This new tree variant is designed in such a way that adding a single new observation does not change the tree fit with overwhelmingly large probability. This add-one-in robustness property allows us to conclude a finite sample group-conditional coverage guarantee, a refinement of the marginal guarantee. In addition, unlike traditional split-conformal inference, adaptive splitting and within-group calibration yields adaptive bands which can stretch and shrink locally. We demonstrate benefits of local tightening on several simulated as well as real examples using non-parametric regression. Finally, we consider two contemporary classification applications for obtaining uncertainty quantification around GPT-4o predictions. We conformalize skin disease diagnoses based on self-reported symptoms as well as predicted states of U.S. legislators based on summaries of their ideology. We demonstrate substantial local tightening of the uncertainty sets while attaining similar marginal coverage.</description>

      <title>Classifier-Free Guidance is a Predictor-Corrector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the theoretical foundations of classifier-free guidance (CFG). CFG is the dominant method of conditional sampling for text-to-image diffusion models, yet unlike other aspects of diffusion, it remains on shaky theoretical footing. In this paper, we disprove common misconceptions, by showing that CFG interacts differently with DDPM (Ho et al., 2020) and DDIM (Song et al., 2021), and neither sampler with CFG generates the gamma-powered distribution $p(x|c)^\gamma p(x)^{1-\gamma}$. Then, we clarify the behavior of CFG by showing that it is a kind of predictor-corrector method (Song et al., 2020) that alternates between denoising and sharpening, which we call predictor-corrector guidance (PCG). We prove that in the SDE limit, CFG is actually equivalent to combining a DDIM predictor for the conditional distribution together with a Langevin dynamics corrector for a gamma-powered distribution (with a carefully chosen gamma). Our work thus provides a lens to theoretically understand CFG by embedding it in a broader design space of principled sampling methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient Autoregressive Audio Modeling via Next-Scale Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio generation has achieved remarkable progress with the advance of sophisticated generative models, such as diffusion models (DMs) and autoregressive (AR) models. However, due to the naturally significant sequence length of audio, the efficiency of audio generation remains an essential issue to be addressed, especially for AR models that are incorporated in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we analyze the token length of audio tokenization and propose a novel \textbf{S}cale-level \textbf{A}udio \textbf{T}okenizer (SAT), with improved residual quantization. Based on SAT, a scale-level \textbf{A}coustic \textbf{A}uto\textbf{R}egressive (AAR) modeling framework is further proposed, which shifts the next-token AR prediction to next-scale AR prediction, significantly reducing the training cost and inference time. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we comprehensively analyze design choices and demonstrate the proposed AAR framework achieves a remarkable \textbf{35}$\times$ faster inference speed and +\textbf{1.33} Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD) against baselines on the AudioSet benchmark.

      <title>Improving VTE Identification through Language Models from Radiology Reports: A Comparative Study of Mamba, Phi-3 Mini, and BERT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a critical cardiovascular condition, encompassing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Accurate and timely identification of VTE is essential for effective medical care. This study builds upon our previous work, which addressed VTE detection using deep learning methods for DVT and a hybrid approach combining deep learning and rule-based classification for PE. Our earlier approaches, while effective, had two major limitations: they were complex and required expert involvement for feature engineering of the rule set. To overcome these challenges, we utilize the Mamba architecture-based classifier. This model achieves remarkable results, with a 97\% accuracy and F1 score on the DVT dataset and a 98\% accuracy and F1 score on the PE dataset. In contrast to the previous hybrid method on PE identification, the Mamba classifier eliminates the need for hand-engineered rules, significantly reducing model complexity while maintaining comparable performance. Additionally, we evaluated a lightweight Large Language Model (LLM), Phi-3 Mini, in detecting VTE. While this model delivers competitive results, outperforming the baseline BERT models, it proves to be computationally intensive due to its larger parameter set. Our evaluation shows that the Mamba-based model demonstrates superior performance and efficiency in VTE identification, offering an effective solution to the limitations of previous approaches.</description>

      <title>mRNA2vec: mRNA Embedding with Language Model in the 5'UTR-CDS for mRNA Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines are accelerating the discovery of new drugs and revolutionizing the pharmaceutical industry. However, selecting particular mRNA sequences for vaccines and therapeutics from extensive mRNA libraries is costly. Effective mRNA therapeutics require carefully designed sequences with optimized expression levels and stability. This paper proposes a novel contextual language model (LM)-based embedding method: mRNA2vec. In contrast to existing mRNA embedding approaches, our method is based on the self-supervised teacher-student learning framework of data2vec. We jointly use the 5' untranslated region (UTR) and coding sequence (CDS) region as the input sequences. We adapt our LM-based approach specifically to mRNA by 1) considering the importance of location on the mRNA sequence with probabilistic masking, 2) using Minimum Free Energy (MFE) prediction and Secondary Structure (SS) classification as additional pretext tasks. mRNA2vec demonstrates significant improvements in translation efficiency (TE) and expression level (EL) prediction tasks in UTR compared to SOTA methods such as UTR-LM. It also gives a competitive performance in mRNA stability and protein production level tasks in CDS such as CodonBERT.</description>

      <title>Language Models Show Stable Value Orientations Across Diverse Role-Plays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) exhibit consistent value orientations despite adopting diverse personas, revealing a persistent inertia in their responses that remains stable across the variety of roles they are prompted to assume. To systematically explore this phenomenon, we introduce the role-play-at-scale methodology, which involves prompting LLMs with randomized, diverse personas and analyzing the macroscopic trend of their responses. Unlike previous works that simply feed these questions to LLMs as if testing human subjects, our role-play-at-scale methodology diagnoses inherent tendencies in a systematic and scalable manner by: (1) prompting the model to act in different random personas and (2) asking the same question multiple times for each random persona. This approach reveals consistent patterns in LLM responses across diverse role-play scenarios, indicating deeply encoded inherent tendencies. Our findings contribute to the discourse on value alignment in foundation models and demonstrate the efficacy of role-play-at-scale as a diagnostic tool for uncovering encoded biases in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Learning to Route for Dynamic Adapter Composition in Continual Learning with Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are increasingly used with pre-trained language models (PLMs) for continual learning (CL). These methods involve training a PEFT module for each new task and using similarity-based selection to route modules during inference. However, they face two major limitations: 1) interference with already learned modules and 2) suboptimal routing when composing modules. In this paper, we introduce a method that isolates the training of PEFT modules for task specialization. Then, before evaluation, it learns to compose the previously learned modules by training a router that leverages samples from a small memory. We evaluate our method in two CL setups using several benchmarks. Our results show that our method provides a better composition of PEFT modules, leading to better generalization and performance compared to previous methods.</description>

      <title>Linking Robustness and Generalization: A k* Distribution Analysis of Concept Clustering in Latent Space for Vision Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most evaluations of vision models use indirect methods to assess latent space quality. These methods often involve adding extra layers to project the latent space into a new one. This projection makes it difficult to analyze and compare the original latent space. This article uses the k* Distribution, a local neighborhood analysis method, to examine the learned latent space at the level of individual concepts, which can be extended to examine the entire latent space. We introduce skewness-based true and approximate metrics for interpreting individual concepts to assess the overall quality of vision models' latent space. Our findings indicate that current vision models frequently fracture the distributions of individual concepts within the latent space. Nevertheless, as these models improve in generalization across multiple datasets, the degree of fracturing diminishes. A similar trend is observed in robust vision models, where increased robustness correlates with reduced fracturing. Ultimately, this approach enables a direct interpretation and comparison of the latent spaces of different vision models and reveals a relationship between a model's generalizability and robustness. Results show that as a model becomes more general and robust, it tends to learn features that result in better clustering of concepts.

      <description>arXiv:2408.09097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depth information provides valuable insights into the 3D structure especially the outline of objects, which can be utilized to improve the semantic segmentation tasks. However, a naive fusion of depth information can disrupt feature and compromise accuracy due to the modality gap between the depth and the vision. In this work, we introduce a Depth-guided Texture Diffusion approach that effectively tackles the outlined challenge. Our method extracts low-level features from edges and textures to create a texture image. This image is then selectively diffused across the depth map, enhancing structural information vital for precisely extracting object outlines. By integrating this enriched depth map with the original RGB image into a joint feature embedding, our method effectively bridges the disparity between the depth map and the image, enabling more accurate semantic segmentation. We conduct comprehensive experiments across diverse, commonly-used datasets spanning a wide range of semantic segmentation tasks, including Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), Salient Object Detection (SOD), and indoor semantic segmentation. With source-free estimated depth or depth captured by depth cameras, our method consistently outperforms existing baselines and achieves new state-of-theart results, demonstrating the effectiveness of our Depth-guided Texture Diffusion for image semantic segmentation.</description>

      <title>Fragment-Masked Molecular Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular optimization is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, aimed at refining molecular structures to enhance drug efficacy and minimize side effects, ultimately accelerating the overall drug development process. Many target-based molecular optimization methods have been proposed, significantly advancing drug discovery. These methods primarily on understanding the specific drug target structures or their hypothesized roles in combating diseases. However, challenges such as a limited number of available targets and a difficulty capturing clear structures hinder innovative drug development. In contrast, phenotypic drug discovery (PDD) does not depend on clear target structures and can identify hits with novel and unbiased polypharmacology signatures. As a result, PDD-based molecular optimization can reduce potential safety risks while optimizing phenotypic activity, thereby increasing the likelihood of clinical success. Therefore, we propose a fragment-masked molecular optimization method based on PDD (FMOP). FMOP employs a regression-free diffusion model to conditionally optimize the molecular masked regions without training, effectively generating new molecules with similar scaffolds. On the large-scale drug response dataset GDSCv2, we optimize the potential molecules across all 945 cell lines. The overall experiments demonstrate that the in-silico optimization success rate reaches 94.4%, with an average efficacy increase of 5.3%. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation and visualization experiments, confirming that FMOP is an effective and robust molecular optimization method. The code is available at:https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FMOP-98C2.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) such as Copilot and ChatGPT have transformed software development by automating coding tasks. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in reducing error rates and fully meeting user expectations. Our empirical study reveals LLMs tend to dilute their self-attention on the initial prompt as more code tokens are generated. We hypothesize this self-attention dilution issue is one of the root causes of inaccuracies in LLM-generated code. To mitigate this issue, we propose Selective Prompt Anchoring (SPA). SPA amplifies the influence of the selected parts in the initial prompt, which we refer to as ``anchored text'', during code generation. Specifically, SPA calculates the logit distribution difference with and without the anchored text. We prove this difference approximates the anchored text's contextual contribution to the output logits. SPA creates an augmented logit distribution by linearly combining the original logit distribution and the logit difference. We evaluate SPA with five LLMs on four benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that using SPA can consistently improve Pass@1 rates by up to 9.7% in all settings. Notably, with selective text anchoring, a small version of DeepSeek-Coder (6.7B) can achieve better performance than an original much larger version (33B).

      <title>Markov Balance Satisfaction Improves Performance in Strictly Batch Offline Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) is notably effective for robotic tasks where directly programming behaviors or defining optimal control costs is challenging. In this work, we address a scenario where the imitator relies solely on observed behavior and cannot make environmental interactions during learning. It does not have additional supplementary datasets beyond the expert's dataset nor any information about the transition dynamics. Unlike state-of-the-art (SOTA) IL methods, this approach tackles the limitations of conventional IL by operating in a more constrained and realistic setting. Our method uses the Markov balance equation and introduces a novel conditional density estimation-based imitation learning framework. It employs conditional normalizing flows for transition dynamics estimation and aims at satisfying a balance equation for the environment. Through a series of numerical experiments on Classic Control and MuJoCo environments, we demonstrate consistently superior empirical performance compared to many SOTA IL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Identifying Technical Debt and Its Types Across Diverse Software Projects Issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Technical Debt (TD) identification in software projects issues is crucial for maintaining code quality, reducing long-term maintenance costs, and improving overall project health. This study advances TD classification using transformer-based models, addressing the critical need for accurate and efficient TD identification in large-scale software development.
  Our methodology employs multiple binary classifiers for TD and its type, combined through ensemble learning, to enhance accuracy and robustness in detecting various forms of TD. We train and evaluate these models on a comprehensive dataset from GitHub Archive Issues (2015-2024), supplemented with industrial data validation.
  We demonstrate that in-project fine-tuned transformer models significantly outperform task-specific fine-tuned models in TD classification, highlighting the importance of project-specific context in accurate TD identification. Our research also reveals the superiority of specialized binary classifiers over multi-class models for TD and its type identification, enabling more targeted debt resolution strategies. A comparative analysis shows that the smaller DistilRoBERTa model is more effective than larger language models like GPTs for TD classification tasks, especially after fine-tuning, offering insights into efficient model selection for specific TD detection tasks.
  The study also assesses generalization capabilities using metrics such as MCC, AUC ROC, Recall, and F1 score, focusing on model effectiveness, fine-tuning impact, and relative performance. By validating our approach on out-of-distribution and real-world industrial datasets, we ensure practical applicability, addressing the diverse nature of software projects.</description>

      <title>Better Python Programming for all: With the focus on Maintainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to enhance the maintainability of code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), with a focus on the Python programming language. As the use of LLMs for coding assistance grows, so do concerns about the maintainability of the code they produce. Previous research has mainly concentrated on the functional accuracy and testing success of generated code, overlooking aspects of maintainability.
  Our approach involves the use of a specifically designed dataset for training and evaluating the model, ensuring a thorough assessment of code maintainability. At the heart of our work is the fine-tuning of an LLM for code refactoring, aimed at enhancing code readability, reducing complexity, and improving overall maintainability.
  After fine-tuning an LLM to prioritize code maintainability, our evaluations indicate that this model significantly improves code maintainability standards, suggesting a promising direction for the future of AI-assisted software development.</description>

      <title>Vanilla Gradient Descent for Oblique Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision Trees (DTs) constitute one of the major highly non-linear AI models, valued, e.g., for their efficiency on tabular data. Learning accurate DTs is, however, complicated, especially for oblique DTs, and does take a significant training time. Further, DTs suffer from overfitting, e.g., they proverbially "do not generalize" in regression tasks. Recently, some works proposed ways to make (oblique) DTs differentiable. This enables highly efficient gradient-descent algorithms to be used to learn DTs. It also enables generalizing capabilities by learning regressors at the leaves simultaneously with the decisions in the tree. Prior approaches to making DTs differentiable rely either on probabilistic approximations at the tree's internal nodes (soft DTs) or on approximations in gradient computation at the internal node (quantized gradient descent). In this work, we propose \textit{DTSemNet}, a novel \textit{sem}antically equivalent and invertible encoding for (hard, oblique) DTs as Neural \textit{Net}works (NNs), that uses standard vanilla gradient descent. Experiments across various classification and regression benchmarks show that oblique DTs learned using \textit{DTSemNet} are more accurate than oblique DTs of similar size learned using state-of-the-art techniques. Further, DT training time is significantly reduced. We also experimentally demonstrate that \textit{DTSemNet} can learn DT policies as efficiently as NN policies in the Reinforcement Learning (RL) setup with physical inputs (dimensions $\leq32$). The code is available at {\color{blue}\textit{\url{https://github.com/CPS-research-group/dtsemnet}}}.</description>

      <title>Learning to Explore for Stochastic Gradient MCMC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks(BNNs) with high-dimensional parameters pose a challenge for posterior inference due to the multi-modality of the posterior distributions. Stochastic Gradient MCMC(SGMCMC) with cyclical learning rate scheduling is a promising solution, but it requires a large number of sampling steps to explore high-dimensional multi-modal posteriors, making it computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning strategy to build \gls{sgmcmc} which can efficiently explore the multi-modal target distributions. Our algorithm allows the learned SGMCMC to quickly explore the high-density region of the posterior landscape. Also, we show that this exploration property is transferrable to various tasks, even for the ones unseen during a meta-training stage. Using popular image classification benchmarks and a variety of downstream tasks, we demonstrate that our method significantly improves the sampling efficiency, achieving better performance than vanilla \gls{sgmcmc} without incurring significant computational overhead.</description>

      <title>CogLM: Tracking Cognitive Development of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development (PTC) posits that the development of cognitive levels forms the foundation for human learning across various abilities. As Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable abilities across a wide variety of tasks, we are curious about the cognitive levels of current LLMs: to what extent they have developed and how this development has been achieved. To this end, we construct a benchmark CogLM (Cognitive Ability Evaluation for Language Model) based on PTC to assess the cognitive levels of LLMs. CogLM comprises 1,220 questions spanning 10 cognitive abilities crafted by more than 20 human experts, providing a comprehensive testbed for the cognitive levels of LLMs. Through extensive experiments across multiple mainstream LLMs with CogLM, we find that: (1) Human-like cognitive abilities have emerged in advanced LLMs (GPT-4), comparable to those of a 20-year-old human. (2) The parameter size and optimization objective are two key factors affecting the cognitive levels of LLMs. (3) The performance on downstream tasks is positively correlated with the level of cognitive abilities. These findings fill the gap in research on the cognitive abilities of LLMs, tracing the development of LLMs from a cognitive perspective and guiding the future direction of their evolution.</description>

      <title>Linear Attention is Enough in Spatial-Temporal Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the most representative scenario of spatial-temporal forecasting tasks, the traffic forecasting task attracted numerous attention from machine learning community due to its intricate correlation both in space and time dimension. Existing methods often treat road networks over time as spatial-temporal graphs, addressing spatial and temporal representations independently. However, these approaches struggle to capture the dynamic topology of road networks, encounter issues with message passing mechanisms and over-smoothing, and face challenges in learning spatial and temporal relationships separately. To address these limitations, we propose treating nodes in road networks at different time steps as independent spatial-temporal tokens and feeding them into a vanilla Transformer to learn complex spatial-temporal patterns, design STformer achieving SOTA. Given its quadratic complexity, we introduce a variant NSTformer based on Nystr$\ddot{o}$m method to approximate self-attention with linear complexity but even slightly better than former in a few cases astonishingly. Extensive experimental results on traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance at an affordable computational cost. Our code will be made available.</description>

      <title>Ranking Across Different Content Types: The Robust Beauty of Multinomial Blending</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An increasing number of media streaming services have expanded their offerings to include entities of multiple content types. For instance, audio streaming services that started by offering music only, now also offer podcasts, merchandise items, and videos. Ranking items across different content types into a single slate poses a significant challenge for traditional learning-to-rank (LTR) algorithms due to differing user engagement patterns for different content types. We explore a simple method for cross-content-type ranking, called multinomial blending (MB), which can be used in conjunction with most existing LTR algorithms. We compare MB to existing baselines not only in terms of ranking quality but also from other industry-relevant perspectives such as interpretability, ease-of-use, and stability in dynamic environments with changing user behavior and ranking model retraining. Finally, we report the results of an A/B test from an Amazon Music ranking use-case.</description>

      <title>Chinese Metaphor Recognition Using a Multi-stage Prompting Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metaphors are common in everyday language, and the identification and understanding of metaphors are facilitated by models to achieve a better understanding of the text. Metaphors are mainly identified and generated by pre-trained models in existing research, but situations, where tenors or vehicles are not included in the metaphor, cannot be handled. The problem can be effectively solved by using Large Language Models (LLMs), but significant room for exploration remains in this early-stage research area. A multi-stage generative heuristic-enhanced prompt framework is proposed in this study to enhance the ability of LLMs to recognize tenors, vehicles, and grounds in Chinese metaphors. In the first stage, a small model is trained to obtain the required confidence score for answer candidate generation. In the second stage, questions are clustered and sampled according to specific rules. Finally, the heuristic-enhanced prompt needed is formed by combining the generated answer candidates and demonstrations. The proposed model achieved 3rd place in Track 1 of Subtask 1, 1st place in Track 2 of Subtask 1, and 1st place in both tracks of Subtask 2 at the NLPCC-2024 Shared Task 9.</description>

      <title>EEG-SCMM: Soft Contrastive Masked Modeling for Cross-Corpus EEG-Based Emotion Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotion recognition using electroencephalography (EEG) signals has garnered widespread attention in recent years. However, existing studies have struggled to develop a sufficiently generalized model suitable for different datasets without re-training (cross-corpus). This difficulty arises because distribution differences across datasets far exceed the intra-dataset variability. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Soft Contrastive Masked Modeling (SCMM) framework. Inspired by emotional continuity, SCMM integrates soft contrastive learning with a new hybrid masking strategy to effectively mine the "short-term continuity" characteristics inherent in human emotions. During the self-supervised learning process, soft weights are assigned to sample pairs, enabling adaptive learning of similarity relationships across samples. Furthermore, we introduce an aggregator that weightedly aggregates complementary information from multiple close samples based on pairwise similarities among samples to enhance fine-grained feature representation, which is then used for original sample reconstruction. Extensive experiments on the SEED, SEED-IV and DEAP datasets show that SCMM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming the second-best method by an average accuracy of 4.26% under two types of cross-corpus conditions (same-class and different-class) for EEG-based emotion recognition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive impressions for graph-related tasks. However, most GNNs are primarily studied under the cases of signal domain with supervised training, which requires abundant task-specific labels and is difficult to transfer to other domains. There are few works focused on domain adaptation for graph node classification. They mainly focused on aligning the feature space of the source and target domains, without considering the feature alignment between different categories, which may lead to confusion of classification in the target domain. However, due to the scarcity of labels of the target domain, we cannot directly perform effective alignment of categories from different domains, which makes the problem more challenging. In this paper, we present the \textit{Spectral Augmentation for Graph Domain Adaptation (\method{})} for graph node classification. First, we observe that nodes with the same category in different domains exhibit similar characteristics in the spectral domain, while different classes are quite different. Following the observation, we align the category feature space of different domains in the spectral domain instead of aligning the whole features space, and we theoretical proof the stability of proposed \method{}. Then, we develop a dual graph convolutional network to jointly exploits local and global consistency for feature aggregation. Last, we utilize a domain classifier with an adversarial learning submodule to facilitate knowledge transfer between different domain graphs. Experimental results on a variety of publicly available datasets reveal the effectiveness of our \method{}.</description>

      <title>On the Improvement of Generalization and Stability of Forward-Only Learning via Neural Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forward-only learning algorithms have recently gained attention as alternatives to gradient backpropagation, replacing the backward step of this latter solver with an additional contrastive forward pass. Among these approaches, the so-called Forward-Forward Algorithm (FFA) has been shown to achieve competitive levels of performance in terms of generalization and complexity. Networks trained using FFA learn to contrastively maximize a layer-wise defined goodness score when presented with real data (denoted as positive samples) and to minimize it when processing synthetic data (corr. negative samples). However, this algorithm still faces weaknesses that negatively affect the model accuracy and training stability, primarily due to a gradient imbalance between positive and negative samples. To overcome this issue, in this work we propose a novel implementation of the FFA algorithm, denoted as Polar-FFA, which extends the original formulation by introducing a neural division (\emph{polarization}) between positive and negative instances. Neurons in each of these groups aim to maximize their goodness when presented with their respective data type, thereby creating a symmetric gradient behavior. To empirically gauge the improved learning capabilities of our proposed Polar-FFA, we perform several systematic experiments using different activation and goodness functions over image classification datasets. Our results demonstrate that Polar-FFA outperforms FFA in terms of accuracy and convergence speed. Furthermore, its lower reliance on hyperparameters reduces the need for hyperparameter tuning to guarantee optimal generalization capabilities, thereby allowing for a broader range of neural network configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, video action recognition, as a fundamental task in the field of video understanding, has been deeply explored by numerous researchers.Most traditional video action recognition methods typically involve converting videos into three-dimensional data that encapsulates both spatial and temporal information, subsequently leveraging prevalent image understanding models to model and analyze these data. However,these methods have significant drawbacks. Firstly, when delving into video action recognition tasks, image understanding models often need to be adapted accordingly in terms of model architecture and preprocessing for these spatiotemporal tasks; Secondly, dealing with high-dimensional data often poses greater challenges and incurs higher time costs compared to its lower-dimensional counterparts.To bridge the gap between image-understanding and video-understanding tasks while simplifying the complexity of video comprehension, we introduce a novel video representation architecture, Flatten, which serves as a plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated into any image-understanding network for efficient and effective 3D temporal data modeling.Specifically, by applying specific flattening operations (e.g., row-major transform), 3D spatiotemporal data is transformed into 2D spatial information, and then ordinary image understanding models are used to capture temporal dynamic and spatial semantic information, which in turn accomplishes effective and efficient video action recognition. Extensive experiments on commonly used datasets (Kinetics-400, Something-Something v2, and HMDB-51) and three classical image classification models (Uniformer, SwinV2, and ResNet), have demonstrated that embedding Flatten provides a significant performance improvements over original model.</description>

      <title>Reference-Guided Verdict: LLMs-as-Judges in Automatic Evaluation of Free-Form Text</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the critical need for robust evaluation methods that can accurately assess the quality of generated text, particularly in free-form tasks. Traditional metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, while useful, often fail to capture the semantic richness and contextual relevance of free-form text compared to reference answers. In this study, we introduce a reference-guided verdict method that leverages multiple LLMs-as-judges to provide a more reliable and accurate evaluation of open-ended LLM generations. By integrating diverse LLMs, our approach mitigates individual model biases and significantly improves alignment with human judgments, especially in challenging tasks where traditional metrics and single-model evaluations fall short. Through experiments across multiple question-answering tasks, we show that our method closely aligns with human evaluations, establishing it as a scalable, reproducible, and effective alternative to human evaluation. Our approach not only enhances evaluation reliability but also opens new avenues for refining automated assessment in generative AI.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of traditional keyword-based search in understanding user intent and introduces a novel hybrid search approach that leverages the strengths of non-semantic search engines, Large Language Models (LLMs), and embedding models. The proposed system integrates keyword matching, semantic vector embeddings, and LLM-generated structured queries to deliver highly relevant and contextually appropriate search results. By combining these complementary methods, the hybrid approach effectively captures both explicit and implicit user intent.The paper further explores techniques to optimize query execution for faster response times and demonstrates the effectiveness of this hybrid search model in producing comprehensive and accurate search outcomes.</description>

      <title>Towards Effective Top-N Hamming Search via Bipartite Graph Contrastive Hashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searching on bipartite graphs serves as a fundamental task for various real-world applications, such as recommendation systems, database retrieval, and document querying. Conventional approaches rely on similarity matching in continuous Euclidean space of vectorized node embeddings. To handle intensive similarity computation efficiently, hashing techniques for graph-structured data have emerged as a prominent research direction. However, despite the retrieval efficiency in Hamming space, previous studies have encountered catastrophic performance decay. To address this challenge, we investigate the problem of hashing with Graph Convolutional Network for effective Top-N search. Our findings indicate the learning effectiveness of incorporating hashing techniques within the exploration of bipartite graph reception fields, as opposed to simply treating hashing as post-processing to output embeddings. To further enhance the model performance, we advance upon these findings and propose Bipartite Graph Contrastive Hashing (BGCH+). BGCH+ introduces a novel dual augmentation approach to both intermediate information and hash code outputs in the latent feature spaces, thereby producing more expressive and robust hash codes within a dual self-supervised learning paradigm. Comprehensive empirical analyses on six real-world benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our dual feature contrastive learning in boosting the performance of BGCH+ compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in autonomous driving have increasingly focused on end-to-end (E2E) systems that manage the full spectrum of driving tasks, from environmental perception to vehicle navigation and control. This paper introduces V2X-VLM, an innovative E2E vehicle-infrastructure cooperative autonomous driving (VICAD) framework with large vision-language models (VLMs). V2X-VLM is designed to enhance situational awareness, decision-making, and ultimate trajectory planning by integrating data from vehicle-mounted cameras, infrastructure sensors, and textual information. The strength of the comprehensive multimodel data fusion of the VLM enables precise and safe E2E trajectory planning in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Validation on the DAIR-V2X dataset demonstrates that V2X-VLM outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in cooperative autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>PREMAP: A Unifying PREiMage APproximation Framework for Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most methods for neural network verification focus on bounding the image, i.e., set of outputs for a given input set. This can be used to, for example, check the robustness of neural network predictions to bounded perturbations of an input. However, verifying properties concerning the preimage, i.e., the set of inputs satisfying an output property, requires abstractions in the input space. We present a general framework for preimage abstraction that produces under- and over-approximations of any polyhedral output set. Our framework employs cheap parameterised linear relaxations of the neural network, together with an anytime refinement procedure that iteratively partitions the input region by splitting on input features and neurons. The effectiveness of our approach relies on carefully designed heuristics and optimization objectives to achieve rapid improvements in the approximation volume. We evaluate our method on a range of tasks, demonstrating significant improvement in efficiency and scalability to high-input-dimensional image classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Further, we showcase the application to quantitative verification and robustness analysis, presenting a sound and complete algorithm for the former and providing sound quantitative results for the latter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the innovative application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to promote heritage education, focusing on traditional Scottish curling presented in the game ``Scottish Bonspiel VR''. Our study compares the effectiveness of LLM-based chatbots with pre-defined scripted chatbots, evaluating key criteria such as usability, user engagement, and learning outcomes. The results show that LLM-based chatbots significantly improve interactivity and engagement, creating a more dynamic and immersive learning environment. This integration helps document and preserve cultural heritage and enhances dissemination processes, which are crucial for safeguarding intangible cultural heritage (ICH) amid environmental changes. Furthermore, the study highlights the potential of novel technologies in education to provide immersive experiences that foster a deeper appreciation of cultural heritage. These findings support the wider application of LLMs and VR in cultural education to address global challenges and promote sustainable practices to preserve and enhance cultural heritage.</description>

      <title>A Benchmark Time Series Dataset for Semiconductor Fabrication Manufacturing Constructed using Component-based Discrete-Event Simulation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in high-computing devices increase the necessity for improved and new understanding and development of smart manufacturing factories. Discrete-event models with simulators have been shown to be critical to architect, designing, building, and operating the manufacturing of semiconductor chips. The diffusion, implantation, and lithography machines have intricate processes due to their feedforward and feedback connectivity. The dataset collected from simulations of the factory models holds the promise of generating valuable machine-learning models. As surrogate data-based models, their executions are highly efficient compared to the physics-based counterpart models. For the development of surrogate models, it is beneficial to have publicly available benchmark simulation models that are grounded in factory models that have concise structures and accurate behaviors. Hence, in this research, a dataset is devised and constructed based on a benchmark model of an Intel semiconductor fabrication factory. The model is formalized using the Parallel Discrete-Event System Specification and executed using the DEVS-Suite simulator. The time series dataset is constructed using discrete-event time trajectories. This dataset is further analyzed and used to develop baseline univariate and multivariate machine learning models. The dataset can also be utilized in the machine learning community for behavioral analysis based on formalized and scalable component-based discrete-event models and simulations.</description>

      <title>Learning Fair Invariant Representations under Covariate and Correlation Shifts Simultaneously</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving the generalization of an invariant classifier from training domains to shifted test domains while simultaneously considering model fairness is a substantial and complex challenge in machine learning. Existing methods address the problem of fairness-aware domain generalization, focusing on either covariate shift or correlation shift, but rarely consider both at the same time. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that focuses on learning a fairness-aware domain-invariant predictor within a framework addressing both covariate and correlation shifts simultaneously, ensuring its generalization to unknown test domains inaccessible during training. In our approach, data are first disentangled into content and style factors in latent spaces. Furthermore, fairness-aware domain-invariant content representations can be learned by mitigating sensitive information and retaining as much other information as possible. Extensive empirical studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods with respect to model accuracy as well as both group and individual fairness.</description>

      <title>Characterizing and Evaluating the Reliability of LLMs against Jailbreak Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly become pivotal in content generation with notable societal impact. These models hold the potential to generate content that could be deemed harmful.Efforts to mitigate this risk include implementing safeguards to ensure LLMs adhere to social ethics.However, despite such measures, the phenomenon of "jailbreaking" -- where carefully crafted prompts elicit harmful responses from models -- persists as a significant challenge. Recognizing the continuous threat posed by jailbreaking tactics and their repercussions for the trustworthy use of LLMs, a rigorous assessment of the models' robustness against such attacks is essential. This study introduces an comprehensive evaluation framework and conducts an large-scale empirical experiment to address this need. We concentrate on 10 cutting-edge jailbreak strategies across three categories, 1525 questions from 61 specific harmful categories, and 13 popular LLMs. We adopt multi-dimensional metrics such as Attack Success Rate (ASR), Toxicity Score, Fluency, Token Length, and Grammatical Errors to thoroughly assess the LLMs' outputs under jailbreak. By normalizing and aggregating these metrics, we present a detailed reliability score for different LLMs, coupled with strategic recommendations to reduce their susceptibility to such vulnerabilities. Additionally, we explore the relationships among the models, attack strategies, and types of harmful content, as well as the correlations between the evaluation metrics, which proves the validity of our multifaceted evaluation framework. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate a lack of resilience among all tested LLMs against certain strategies, and highlight the need to concentrate on the reliability facets of LLMs. We believe our study can provide valuable insights into enhancing the security evaluation of LLMs against jailbreak within the domain.</description>

      <title>E-CGL: An Efficient Continual Graph Learner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual learning has emerged as a crucial paradigm for learning from sequential data while preserving previous knowledge. In the realm of continual graph learning, where graphs continuously evolve based on streaming graph data, continual graph learning presents unique challenges that require adaptive and efficient graph learning methods in addition to the problem of catastrophic forgetting. The first challenge arises from the interdependencies between different graph data, where previous graphs can influence new data distributions. The second challenge lies in the efficiency concern when dealing with large graphs. To addresses these two problems, we produce an Efficient Continual Graph Learner (E-CGL) in this paper. We tackle the interdependencies issue by demonstrating the effectiveness of replay strategies and introducing a combined sampling strategy that considers both node importance and diversity. To overcome the limitation of efficiency, E-CGL leverages a simple yet effective MLP model that shares weights with a GCN during training, achieving acceleration by circumventing the computationally expensive message passing process. Our method comprehensively surpasses nine baselines on four graph continual learning datasets under two settings, meanwhile E-CGL largely reduces the catastrophic forgetting problem down to an average of -1.1%. Additionally, E-CGL achieves an average of 15.83x training time acceleration and 4.89x inference time acceleration across the four datasets. These results indicate that E-CGL not only effectively manages the correlation between different graph data during continual training but also enhances the efficiency of continual learning on large graphs. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/aubreygjh/E-CGL.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning Empowered Meta-Face: Personalized Speaking Style Adaptation for Audio-Driven 3D Talking Face Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-driven 3D face animation is increasingly vital in live streaming and augmented reality applications. While remarkable progress has been observed, most existing approaches are designed for specific individuals with predefined speaking styles, thus neglecting the adaptability to varied speaking styles. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MetaFace, a novel methodology meticulously crafted for speaking style adaptation. Grounded in the novel concept of meta-learning, MetaFace is composed of several key components: the Robust Meta Initialization Stage (RMIS) for fundamental speaking style adaptation, the Dynamic Relation Mining Neural Process (DRMN) for forging connections between observed and unobserved speaking styles, and the Low-rank Matrix Memory Reduction Approach to enhance the efficiency of model optimization as well as learning style details. Leveraging these novel designs, MetaFace not only significantly outperforms robust existing baselines but also establishes a new state-of-the-art, as substantiated by our experimental results.</description>

      <title>Panorama Tomosynthesis from Head CBCT with Simulated Projection Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Panoramic X-rays are the most commonly used imaging modalities in dental health care. CBCT can produce three-dimensional views of a patient's head, providing clinicians with better diagnostic capability, whereas Panoramic X-ray can capture the entire maxillofacial region in a single image. If the CBCT is already available, it can be beneficial to synthesize a Panoramic X-ray, thereby avoiding an immediate additional scan and extra radiation exposure. Existing methods focus on delineating an approximate dental arch and creating orthogonal projections along this arch. However, no golden standard is available for such dental arch extractions, and this choice can affect the quality of synthesized X-rays. To avoid such issues, we propose a novel method for synthesizing Panoramic X-rays from diverse head CBCTs, employing a simulated projection geometry and dynamic rotation centers. Our method effectively synthesized panoramic views from CBCT, even for patients with missing or nonexistent teeth and in the presence of severe metal implants. Our results demonstrate that this method can generate high-quality panoramic images irrespective of the CBCT scanner geometry.</description>

Abstract: As artificial intelligence progresses, the task of distinguishing between real and AI-generated images is increasingly complicated by sophisticated generative models. This paper presents a novel detection framework adept at robustly identifying images produced by cutting-edge generative AI models, such as DALL-E 3, MidJourney, and Stable Diffusion 3. We introduce a comprehensive dataset, tailored to include images from these advanced generators, which serves as the foundation for extensive evaluation. we propose a classification system that integrates semantic image embeddings with a traditional Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). This baseline system is designed to effectively differentiate between real and AI-generated images under various challenging conditions. Enhancing this approach, we introduce a hybrid architecture that combines Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with the MLP. This hybrid model leverages the adaptive, high-resolution feature transformation capabilities of KAN, enabling our system to capture and analyze complex patterns in AI-generated images that are typically overlooked by conventional models. In out-of-distribution testing, our proposed model consistently outperformed the standard MLP across three out of distribution test datasets, demonstrating superior performance and robustness in classifying real images from AI-generated images with impressive F1 scores.</description>

Abstract: Immersive authoring provides an intuitive medium for users to create 3D scenes via direct manipulation in Virtual Reality (VR). Recent advances in generative AI have enabled the automatic creation of realistic 3D layouts. However, it is unclear how capabilities of generative AI can be used in immersive authoring to support fluid interactions, user agency, and creativity. We introduce VRCopilot, a mixed-initiative system that integrates pre-trained generative AI models into immersive authoring to facilitate human-AI co-creation in VR. VRCopilot presents multimodal interactions to support rapid prototyping and iterations with AI, and intermediate representations such as wireframes to augment user controllability over the created content. Through a series of user studies, we evaluated the potential and challenges in manual, scaffolded, and automatic creation in immersive authoring. We found that scaffolded creation using wireframes enhanced the user agency compared to automatic creation. We also found that manual creation via multimodal specification offers the highest sense of creativity and agency.</description>

      <title>Offline RLHF Methods Need More Accurate Supervision Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), aligning LLMs with human preferences become increasingly important. Although Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) proves effective, it is complicated and highly resource-intensive. As such, offline RLHF has been introduced as an alternative solution, which directly optimizes LLMs with ranking losses on a fixed preference dataset. Current offline RLHF only captures the ``ordinal relationship'' between responses, overlooking the crucial aspect of ``how much'' one is preferred over the others. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective solution called \textbf{R}eward \textbf{D}ifference \textbf{O}ptimization, shorted as \textbf{RDO}. Specifically, we introduce {\it reward difference coefficients} to reweigh sample pairs in offline RLHF. We then develop a {\it difference model} involving rich interactions between a pair of responses for predicting these difference coefficients. Experiments with 7B LLMs on the HH and TL;DR datasets substantiate the effectiveness of our method in both automatic metrics and human evaluation, thereby highlighting its potential for aligning LLMs with human intent and values.</description>

      <title>Federated Graph Learning with Structure Proxy Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) aims to learn graph learning models over graph data distributed in multiple data owners, which has been applied in various applications such as social recommendation and financial fraud detection. Inherited from generic Federated Learning (FL), FGL similarly has the data heterogeneity issue where the label distribution may vary significantly for distributed graph data across clients. For instance, a client can have the majority of nodes from a class, while another client may have only a few nodes from the same class. This issue results in divergent local objectives and impairs FGL convergence for node-level tasks, especially for node classification. Moreover, FGL also encounters a unique challenge for the node classification task: the nodes from a minority class in a client are more likely to have biased neighboring information, which prevents FGL from learning expressive node embeddings with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To grapple with the challenge, we propose FedSpray, a novel FGL framework that learns local class-wise structure proxies in the latent space and aligns them to obtain global structure proxies in the server. Our goal is to obtain the aligned structure proxies that can serve as reliable, unbiased neighboring information for node classification. To achieve this, FedSpray trains a global feature-structure encoder and generates unbiased soft targets with structure proxies to regularize local training of GNN models in a personalized way. We conduct extensive experiments over four datasets, and experiment results validate the superiority of FedSpray compared with other baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/xbfu/FedSpray.</description>

Abstract: The study of word co-occurrence networks has attracted the attention of researchers due to their potential significance as well as applications. Understanding the structure of word co-occurrence networks is therefore important to fully realize their significance and usages. In past studies, word co-occurrence networks built on well-formed texts have been found to possess certain characteristics, including being small-world, following a two-regime power law distribution, and being generally disassortative. On the flip side, past studies have found that word co-occurrence networks built from ill-formed texts such as microblog posts may behave differently from those built from well-formed documents. While both kinds of word co-occurrence networks are small-world and disassortative, word co-occurrence networks built from ill-formed texts are scale-free and follow the power law distribution instead of the two-regime power law distribution. However, since past studies on the behavior of word co-occurrence networks built from ill-formed texts only investigated English, the universality of such characteristics remains to be seen among different languages. In addition, it is yet to be investigated whether there could be possible similitude/differences between word co-occurrence networks and other potentially comparable networks. This study therefore investigates and compares the structure of word co-occurrence networks and word similarity networks based on Taiwan Mandarin ill-formed internet forum posts and compare them with those built with well-formed judicial judgments, and seeks to find out whether the three aforementioned properties (scale-free, small-world, and disassortative) for ill-formed and well-formed texts are universal among different languages and between word co-occurrence and word similarity networks.</description>

      <title>Distinguish Confusion in Legal Judgment Prediction via Revised Relation Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) aims to automatically predict a law case's judgment results based on the text description of its facts. In practice, the confusing law articles (or charges) problem frequently occurs, reflecting that the law cases applicable to similar articles (or charges) tend to be misjudged. Although some recent works based on prior knowledge solve this issue well, they ignore that confusion also occurs between law articles with a high posterior semantic similarity due to the data imbalance problem instead of only between the prior highly similar ones, which is this work's further finding. This paper proposes an end-to-end model named \textit{D-LADAN} to solve the above challenges. On the one hand, D-LADAN constructs a graph among law articles based on their text definition and proposes a graph distillation operation (GDO) to distinguish the ones with a high prior semantic similarity. On the other hand, D-LADAN presents a novel momentum-updated memory mechanism to dynamically sense the posterior similarity between law articles (or charges) and a weighted GDO to adaptively capture the distinctions for revising the inductive bias caused by the data imbalance problem. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate that D-LADAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness.</description>

      <title>A Robust Algorithm for Contactless Fingerprint Enhancement and Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compared to contact fingerprint images, contactless fingerprint images exhibit four distinct characteristics: (1) they contain less noise; (2) they have fewer discontinuities in ridge patterns; (3) the ridge-valley pattern is less distinct; and (4) they pose an interoperability problem, as they lack the elastic deformation caused by pressing the finger against the capture device. These properties present significant challenges for the enhancement of contactless fingerprint images. In this study, we propose a novel contactless fingerprint identification solution that enhances the accuracy of minutiae detection through improved frequency estimation and a new region-quality-based minutia extraction algorithm. In addition, we introduce an efficient and highly accurate minutiae-based encoding and matching algorithm. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experimental testing. Our method achieves a minimum Equal Error Rate (EER) of 2.84\% on the PolyU contactless fingerprint dataset, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed fingerprint identification method exhibits notable precision and resilience, proving to be an effective and feasible solution for contactless fingerprint-based identification systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation (SST) takes streaming speech input and generates text translation on the fly. Existing methods either have high latency due to recomputation of input representations, or fall behind of offline ST in translation quality. In this paper, we propose FASST, a fast large language model based method for streaming speech translation. We propose blockwise-causal speech encoding and consistency mask, so that streaming speech input can be encoded incrementally without recomputation. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage training strategy to optimize FASST for simultaneous inference. We evaluate FASST and multiple strong prior models on MuST-C dataset. Experiment results show that FASST achieves the best quality-latency trade-off. It outperforms the previous best model by an average of 1.5 BLEU under the same latency for English to Spanish translation.</description>

      <title>Deformation-aware GAN for Medical Image Synthesis with Substantially Misaligned Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical image synthesis generates additional imaging modalities that are costly, invasive or harmful to acquire, which helps to facilitate the clinical workflow. When training pairs are substantially misaligned (e.g., lung MRI-CT pairs with respiratory motion), accurate image synthesis remains a critical challenge. Recent works explored the directional registration module to adjust misalignment in generative adversarial networks (GANs); however, substantial misalignment will lead to 1) suboptimal data mapping caused by correspondence ambiguity, and 2) degraded image fidelity caused by morphology influence on discriminators. To address the challenges, we propose a novel Deformation-aware GAN (DA-GAN) to dynamically correct the misalignment during the image synthesis based on multi-objective inverse consistency. Specifically, in the generative process, three levels of inverse consistency cohesively optimise symmetric registration and image generation for improved correspondence. In the adversarial process, to further improve image fidelity under misalignment, we design deformation-aware discriminators to disentangle the mismatched spatial morphology from the judgement of image fidelity. Experimental results show that DA-GAN achieved superior performance on a public dataset with simulated misalignments and a real-world lung MRI-CT dataset with respiratory motion misalignment. The results indicate the potential for a wide range of medical image synthesis tasks such as radiotherapy planning.</description>

      <title>HySem: A context length optimized LLM pipeline for unstructured tabular extraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regulatory compliance reporting in the pharmaceutical industry relies on detailed tables, but these are often under-utilized beyond compliance due to their unstructured format and arbitrary content. Extracting and semantically representing tabular data is challenging due to diverse table presentations. Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate substantial potential for semantic representation, yet they encounter challenges related to accuracy and context size limitations, which are crucial considerations for the industry applications. We introduce HySem, a pipeline that employs a novel context length optimization technique to generate accurate semantic JSON representations from HTML tables. This approach utilizes a custom fine-tuned model specifically designed for cost- and privacy-sensitive small and medium pharmaceutical enterprises. Running on commodity hardware and leveraging open-source models, our auto-correcting agents rectify both syntax and semantic errors in LLM-generated content. HySem surpasses its peer open-source models in accuracy and provides competitive performance when benchmarked against OpenAI GPT-4o and effectively addresses context length limitations, which is a crucial factor for supporting larger tables.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Modal Fusion by Alignment and Label Matching for Multimodal Emotion Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address the limitation in multimodal emotion recognition (MER) performance arising from inter-modal information fusion, we propose a novel MER framework based on multitask learning where fusion occurs after alignment, called Foal-Net. The framework is designed to enhance the effectiveness of modality fusion and includes two auxiliary tasks: audio-video emotion alignment (AVEL) and cross-modal emotion label matching (MEM). First, AVEL achieves alignment of emotional information in audio-video representations through contrastive learning. Then, a modal fusion network integrates the aligned features. Meanwhile, MEM assesses whether the emotions of the current sample pair are the same, providing assistance for modal information fusion and guiding the model to focus more on emotional information. The experimental results conducted on IEMOCAP corpus show that Foal-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and emotion alignment is necessary before modal fusion.</description>

      <title>Towards Boosting LLMs-driven Relevance Modeling with Progressive Retrieved Behavior-augmented Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relevance modeling is a critical component for enhancing user experience in search engines, with the primary objective of identifying items that align with users' queries. Traditional models only rely on the semantic congruence between queries and items to ascertain relevance. However, this approach represents merely one aspect of the relevance judgement, and is insufficient in isolation. Even powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) still cannot accurately judge the relevance of a query and an item from a semantic perspective. To augment LLMs-driven relevance modeling, this study proposes leveraging user interactions recorded in search logs to yield insights into users' implicit search intentions. The challenge lies in the effective prompting of LLMs to capture dynamic search intentions, which poses several obstacles in real-world relevance scenarios, i.e., the absence of domain-specific knowledge, the inadequacy of an isolated prompt, and the prohibitive costs associated with deploying LLMs. In response, we propose ProRBP, a novel Progressive Retrieved Behavior-augmented Prompting framework for integrating search scenario-oriented knowledge with LLMs effectively. Specifically, we perform the user-driven behavior neighbors retrieval from the daily search logs to obtain domain-specific knowledge in time, retrieving candidates that users consider to meet their expectations. Then, we guide LLMs for relevance modeling by employing advanced prompting techniques that progressively improve the outputs of the LLMs, followed by a progressive aggregation with comprehensive consideration of diverse aspects. For online serving, we have developed an industrial application framework tailored for the deployment of LLMs in relevance modeling. Experiments on real-world industry data and online A/B testing demonstrate our proposal achieves promising performance.</description>

      <title>Parallel Sampling via Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to use parallelization to speed up sampling from an arbitrary distribution $\mu$ on a product space $[q]^n$, given oracle access to counting queries: $\mathbb{P}_{X\sim \mu}[X_S=\sigma_S]$ for any $S\subseteq [n]$ and $\sigma_S \in [q]^S$. Our algorithm takes $O({n^{2/3}\cdot \operatorname{polylog}(n,q)})$ parallel time, to the best of our knowledge, the first sublinear in $n$ runtime for arbitrary distributions. Our results have implications for sampling in autoregressive models. Our algorithm directly works with an equivalent oracle that answers conditional marginal queries $\mathbb{P}_{X\sim \mu}[X_i=\sigma_i\;\vert\; X_S=\sigma_S]$, whose role is played by a trained neural network in autoregressive models. This suggests a roughly $n^{1/3}$-factor speedup is possible for sampling in any-order autoregressive models. We complement our positive result by showing a lower bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1/3})$ for the runtime of any parallel sampling algorithm making at most $\operatorname{poly}(n)$ queries to the counting oracle, even for $q=2$.</description>

      <title>GraphSPNs: Sum-Product Networks Benefit From Canonical Orderings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models have recently made a remarkable progress in capturing complex probability distributions over graphs. However, they are intractable and thus unable to answer even the most basic probabilistic inference queries without resorting to approximations. Therefore, we propose graph sum-product networks (GraphSPNs), a tractable deep generative model which provides exact and efficient inference over (arbitrary parts of) graphs. We investigate different principles to make SPNs permutation invariant. We demonstrate that GraphSPNs are able to (conditionally) generate novel and chemically valid molecular graphs, being competitive to, and sometimes even better than, existing intractable models. We find out that (Graph)SPNs benefit from ensuring the permutation invariance via canonical ordering.</description>

      <title>In-Memory Learning Automata Architecture using Y-Flash Cell</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modern implementation of machine learning architectures faces significant challenges due to frequent data transfer between memory and processing units. In-memory computing, primarily through memristor-based analog computing, offers a promising solution to overcome this von Neumann bottleneck. In this technology, data processing and storage are located inside the memory. Here, we introduce a novel approach that utilizes floating-gate Y-Flash memristive devices manufactured with a standard 180 nm CMOS process. These devices offer attractive features, including analog tunability and moderate device-to-device variation; such characteristics are essential for reliable decision-making in ML applications. This paper uses a new machine learning algorithm, the Tsetlin Machine (TM), for in-memory processing architecture. The TM's learning element, Automaton, is mapped into a single Y-Flash cell, where the Automaton's range is transferred into the Y-Flash's conductance scope. Through comprehensive simulations, the proposed hardware implementation of the learning automata, particularly for Tsetlin machines, has demonstrated enhanced scalability and on-edge learning capabilities.</description>

      <title>MedMAP: Promoting Incomplete Multi-modal Brain Tumor Segmentation with Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is often based on multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, in clinical practice, certain modalities of MRI may be missing, which presents a more difficult scenario. To cope with this challenge, Knowledge Distillation, Domain Adaption, and Shared Latent Space have emerged as commonly promising strategies. However, recent efforts typically overlook the modality gaps and thus fail to learn important invariant feature representations across different modalities. Such drawback consequently leads to limited performance for missing modality models. To ameliorate these problems, pre-trained models are used in natural visual segmentation tasks to minimize the gaps. However, promising pre-trained models are often unavailable in medical image segmentation tasks. Along this line, in this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that aligns latent features of involved modalities to a well-defined distribution anchor as the substitution of the pre-trained model}. As a major contribution, we prove that our novel training paradigm ensures a tight evidence lower bound, thus theoretically certifying its effectiveness. Extensive experiments on different backbones validate that the proposed paradigm can enable invariant feature representations and produce models with narrowed modality gaps. Models with our alignment paradigm show their superior performance on both BraTS2018 and BraTS2020 datasets.</description>

      <title>PanoSent: A Panoptic Sextuple Extraction Benchmark for Multimodal Conversational Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While existing Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has received extensive effort and advancement, there are still gaps in defining a more holistic research target seamlessly integrating multimodality, conversation context, fine-granularity, and also covering the changing sentiment dynamics as well as cognitive causal rationales. This paper bridges the gaps by introducing a multimodal conversational ABSA, where two novel subtasks are proposed: 1) Panoptic Sentiment Sextuple Extraction, panoramically recognizing holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment, rationale from multi-turn multi-party multimodal dialogue. 2) Sentiment Flipping Analysis, detecting the dynamic sentiment transformation throughout the conversation with the causal reasons. To benchmark the tasks, we construct PanoSent, a dataset annotated both manually and automatically, featuring high quality, large scale, multimodality, multilingualism, multi-scenarios, and covering both implicit and explicit sentiment elements. To effectively address the tasks, we devise a novel Chain-of-Sentiment reasoning framework, together with a novel multimodal large language model (namely Sentica) and a paraphrase-based verification mechanism. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our methods over strong baselines, validating the efficacy of all our proposed methods. The work is expected to open up a new era for the ABSA community, and thus all our codes and data are open at https://PanoSent.github.io/</description>

      <title>REFINE-LM: Mitigating Language Model Stereotypes via Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the introduction of (large) language models, there has been significant concern about the unintended bias such models may inherit from their training data. A number of studies have shown that such models propagate gender stereotypes, as well as geographical and racial bias, among other biases. While existing works tackle this issue by preprocessing data and debiasing embeddings, the proposed methods require a lot of computational resources and annotation effort while being limited to certain types of biases. To address these issues, we introduce REFINE-LM, a debiasing method that uses reinforcement learning to handle different types of biases without any fine-tuning. By training a simple model on top of the word probability distribution of a LM, our bias agnostic reinforcement learning method enables model debiasing without human annotations or significant computational resources. Experiments conducted on a wide range of models, including several LMs, show that our method (i) significantly reduces stereotypical biases while preserving LMs performance; (ii) is applicable to different types of biases, generalizing across contexts such as gender, ethnicity, religion, and nationality-based biases; and (iii) it is not expensive to train.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Invariant Principle for Heterophilic Graph Structure Distribution Shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterophilic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown promising results for semi-supervised learning tasks on graphs. Notably, most real-world heterophilic graphs are composed of a mixture of nodes with different neighbor patterns, exhibiting local node-level homophilic and heterophilic structures. However, existing works are only devoted to designing better HGNN backbones or architectures for node classification tasks on heterophilic and homophilic graph benchmarks simultaneously, and their analyses of HGNN performance with respect to nodes are only based on the determined data distribution without exploring the effect caused by this structural difference between training and testing nodes. How to learn invariant node representations on heterophilic graphs to handle this structure difference or distribution shifts remains unexplored. In this paper, we first discuss the limitations of previous graph-based invariant learning methods from the perspective of data augmentation. Then, we propose \textbf{HEI}, a framework capable of generating invariant node representations through incorporating heterophily information to infer latent environments without augmentation, which are then used for invariant prediction, under heterophilic graph structure distribution shifts. We theoretically show that our proposed method can achieve guaranteed performance under heterophilic graph structure distribution shifts.

      <title>Beyond Local Views: Global State Inference with Diffusion Models for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In partially observable multi-agent systems, agents typically only have access to local observations. This severely hinders their ability to make precise decisions, particularly during decentralized execution. To alleviate this problem and inspired by image outpainting, we propose State Inference with Diffusion Models (SIDIFF), which uses diffusion models to reconstruct the original global state based solely on local observations. SIDIFF consists of a state generator and a state extractor, which allow agents to choose suitable actions by considering both the reconstructed global state and local observations. In addition, SIDIFF can be effortlessly incorporated into current multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms to improve their performance. Finally, we evaluated SIDIFF on different experimental platforms, including Multi-Agent Battle City (MABC), a novel and flexible multi-agent reinforcement learning environment we developed. SIDIFF achieved desirable results and outperformed other popular algorithms.</description>

      <title>Out-of-distribution generalization via composition: a lens through induction heads in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 sometimes appear to be creative, solving novel tasks often with a few demonstrations in the prompt. These tasks require the models to generalize on distributions different from those from training data -- which is known as out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Despite the tremendous success of LLMs, how they approach OOD generalization remains an open and underexplored question. We examine OOD generalization in settings where instances are generated according to hidden rules, including in-context learning with symbolic reasoning. Models are required to infer the hidden rules behind input prompts without any fine-tuning.
  We empirically examined the training dynamics of Transformers on a synthetic example and conducted extensive experiments on a variety of pretrained LLMs, focusing on a type of components known as induction heads. We found that OOD generalization and composition are tied together -- models can learn rules by composing two self-attention layers, thereby achieving OOD generalization. Furthermore, a shared latent subspace in the embedding (or feature) space acts as a bridge for composition by aligning early layers and later layers, which we refer to as the common bridge representation hypothesis.</description>

      <title>A Logic for Policy Based Resource Exchanges in Multiagent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multiagent systems autonomous agents interact with each other to achieve individual and collective goals. Typical interactions concern negotiation and agreement on resource exchanges. Modeling and formalizing these agreements pose significant challenges, particularly in capturing the dynamic behaviour of agents, while ensuring that resources are correctly handled. Here, we propose exchange environments as a formal setting where agents specify and obey exchange policies, which are declarative statements about what resources they offer and what they require in return. Furthermore, we introduce a decidable extension of the computational fragment of linear logic as a fundamental tool for representing exchange environments and studying their dynamics in terms of provability.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Interpretable Transformers Using PDEs and Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel unified theoretical framework for understanding Transformer architectures by integrating Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), Neural Information Flow Theory, and Information Bottleneck Theory. We model Transformer information dynamics as a continuous PDE process, encompassing diffusion, self-attention, and nonlinear residual components. Our comprehensive experiments across image and text modalities demonstrate that the PDE model effectively captures key aspects of Transformer behavior, achieving high similarity (cosine similarity &gt; 0.98) with Transformer attention distributions across all layers. While the model excels in replicating general information flow patterns, it shows limitations in fully capturing complex, non-linear transformations. This work provides crucial theoretical insights into Transformer mechanisms, offering a foundation for future optimizations in deep learning architectural design. We discuss the implications of our findings, potential applications in model interpretability and efficiency, and outline directions for enhancing PDE models to better mimic the intricate behaviors observed in Transformers, paving the way for more transparent and optimized AI systems.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved great success in various reasoning tasks. In this work, we focus on the graph reasoning ability of LLMs. Although theoretical studies proved that LLMs are capable of handling graph reasoning tasks, empirical evaluations reveal numerous failures. To deepen our understanding on this discrepancy, we revisit the ability of LLMs on three fundamental graph tasks: graph description translation, graph connectivity, and the shortest-path problem. Our findings suggest that LLMs can fail to understand graph structures through text descriptions and exhibit varying performance for all these three fundamental tasks. Meanwhile, we perform a real-world investigation on knowledge graphs and make consistent observations with our findings. The codes and datasets are available.</description>

      <title>Using ChatGPT to Score Essays and Short-Form Constructed Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aimed to determine if ChatGPT's large language models could match the scoring accuracy of human and machine scores from the ASAP competition. The investigation focused on various prediction models, including linear regression, random forest, gradient boost, and boost. ChatGPT's performance was evaluated against human raters using quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) metrics. Results indicated that while ChatGPT's gradient boost model achieved QWKs close to human raters for some data sets, its overall performance was inconsistent and often lower than human scores. The study highlighted the need for further refinement, particularly in handling biases and ensuring scoring fairness. Despite these challenges, ChatGPT demonstrated potential for scoring efficiency, especially with domain-specific fine-tuning. The study concludes that ChatGPT can complement human scoring but requires additional development to be reliable for high-stakes assessments. Future research should improve model accuracy, address ethical considerations, and explore hybrid models combining ChatGPT with empirical methods.</description>

      <title>Addressing Heterogeneity in Federated Learning: Challenges and Solutions for a Shared Production Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach to training machine learning models across decentralized data sources while preserving data privacy, particularly in manufacturing and shared production environments. However, the presence of data heterogeneity variations in data distribution, quality, and volume across different or clients and production sites, poses significant challenges to the effectiveness and efficiency of FL. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of heterogeneity in FL within the context of manufacturing, detailing the types and sources of heterogeneity, including non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, unbalanced data, variable data quality, and statistical heterogeneity. We discuss the impact of these types of heterogeneity on model training and review current methodologies for mitigating their adverse effects. These methodologies include personalized and customized models, robust aggregation techniques, and client selection techniques. By synthesizing existing research and proposing new strategies, this paper aims to provide insight for effectively managing data heterogeneity in FL, enhancing model robustness, and ensuring fair and efficient training across diverse environments. Future research directions are also identified, highlighting the need for adaptive and scalable solutions to further improve the FL paradigm in the context of Industry 4.0.</description>

      <title>HiAgent: Hierarchical Working Memory Management for Solving Long-Horizon Agent Tasks with Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents exhibit significant potential across various domains, operating as interactive systems that process environmental observations to generate executable actions for target tasks. The effectiveness of these agents is significantly influenced by their memory mechanism, which records historical experiences as sequences of action-observation pairs. We categorize memory into two types: cross-trial memory, accumulated across multiple attempts, and in-trial memory (working memory), accumulated within a single attempt. While considerable research has optimized performance through cross-trial memory, the enhancement of agent performance through improved working memory utilization remains underexplored. Instead, existing approaches often involve directly inputting entire historical action-observation pairs into LLMs, leading to redundancy in long-horizon tasks. Inspired by human problem-solving strategies, this paper introduces HiAgent, a framework that leverages subgoals as memory chunks to manage the working memory of LLM-based agents hierarchically. Specifically, HiAgent prompts LLMs to formulate subgoals before generating executable actions and enables LLMs to decide proactively to replace previous subgoals with summarized observations, retaining only the action-observation pairs relevant to the current subgoal. Experimental results across five long-horizon tasks demonstrate that HiAgent achieves a twofold increase in success rate and reduces the average number of steps required by 3.8. Additionally, our analysis shows that HiAgent consistently improves performance across various steps, highlighting its robustness and generalizability.

      <title>Grammatical Error Feedback: An Implicit Evaluation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grammatical feedback is crucial for consolidating second language (L2) learning. Most research in computer-assisted language learning has focused on feedback through grammatical error correction (GEC) systems, rather than examining more holistic feedback that may be more useful for learners. This holistic feedback will be referred to as grammatical error feedback (GEF). In this paper, we present a novel implicit evaluation approach to GEF that eliminates the need for manual feedback annotations. Our method adopts a grammatical lineup approach where the task is to pair feedback and essay representations from a set of possible alternatives. This matching process can be performed by appropriately prompting a large language model (LLM). An important aspect of this process, explored here, is the form of the lineup, i.e., the selection of foils. This paper exploits this framework to examine the quality and need for GEC to generate feedback, as well as the system used to generate feedback, using essays from the Cambridge Learner Corpus.</description>

      <title>MergeRepair: An Exploratory Study on Merging Task-Specific Adapters in Code LLMs for Automated Program Repair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [Context] Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown good performance in several software development-related tasks such as program repair, documentation, code refactoring, debugging, and testing. Adapters are specialized, small modules designed for parameter efficient fine-tuning of LLMs for specific tasks, domains, or applications without requiring extensive retraining of the entire model. These adapters offer a more efficient way to customize LLMs for particular needs, leveraging the pre-existing capabilities of the large model. Merging LLMs and adapters has shown promising results for various natural language domains and tasks, enabling the use of the learned models and adapters without additional training for a new task. [Objective] This research proposes continual merging and empirically studies the capabilities of merged adapters in Code LLMs, specially for the Automated Program Repair (APR) task. The goal is to gain insights into whether and how merging task-specific adapters can affect the performance of APR. [Method] In our framework, MergeRepair, we plan to merge multiple task-specific adapters using three different merging methods and evaluate the performance of the merged adapter for the APR task. Particularly, we will employ two main merging scenarios for all three techniques, (i) merging using equal-weight averaging applied on parameters of different adapters, where all adapters are of equal importance; and (ii) our proposed approach, continual merging, in which we sequentially merge the task-specific adapters and the order and weight of merged adapters matter. By exploratory study of merging techniques, we will investigate the improvement and generalizability of merged adapters for APR. Through continual merging, we will explore the capability of merged adapters and the effect of task order, as it occurs in real-world software projects.</description>

      <title>Say My Name: a Model's Bias Discovery Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last few years, due to the broad applicability of deep learning to downstream tasks and end-to-end training capabilities, increasingly more concerns about potential biases to specific, non-representative patterns have been raised. Many works focusing on unsupervised debiasing usually leverage the tendency of deep models to learn ``easier'' samples, for example by clustering the latent space to obtain bias pseudo-labels. However, the interpretation of such pseudo-labels is not trivial, especially for a non-expert end user, as it does not provide semantic information about the bias features. To address this issue, we introduce ``Say My Name'' (SaMyNa), the first tool to identify biases within deep models semantically. Unlike existing methods, our approach focuses on biases learned by the model. Our text-based pipeline enhances explainability and supports debiasing efforts: applicable during either training or post-hoc validation, our method can disentangle task-related information and proposes itself as a tool to analyze biases. Evaluation on traditional benchmarks demonstrates its effectiveness in detecting biases and even disclaiming them, showcasing its broad applicability for model diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning on Augmented Gene Expression Profiles for Enhanced Lung Cancer Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gene expression profiles obtained through DNA microarray have proven successful in providing critical information for cancer detection classifiers. However, the limited number of samples in these datasets poses a challenge to employ complex methodologies such as deep neural networks for sophisticated analysis. To address this "small data" dilemma, Meta-Learning has been introduced as a solution to enhance the optimization of machine learning models by utilizing similar datasets, thereby facilitating a quicker adaptation to target datasets without the requirement of sufficient samples. In this study, we present a meta-learning-based approach for predicting lung cancer from gene expression profiles. We apply this framework to well-established deep learning methodologies and employ four distinct datasets for the meta-learning tasks, where one as the target dataset and the rest as source datasets. Our approach is evaluated against both traditional and deep learning methodologies, and the results show the superior performance of meta-learning on augmented source data compared to the baselines trained on single datasets. Moreover, we conduct the comparative analysis between meta-learning and transfer learning methodologies to highlight the efficiency of the proposed approach in addressing the challenges associated with limited sample sizes. Finally, we incorporate the explainability study to illustrate the distinctiveness of decisions made by meta-learning.</description>

      <title>How to Make the Most of LLMs' Grammatical Knowledge for Acceptability Judgments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The grammatical knowledge of language models (LMs) is often measured using a benchmark of linguistic minimal pairs, where LMs are presented with a pair of acceptable and unacceptable sentences and required to judge which is acceptable. The existing dominant approach, however, naively calculates and compares the probabilities of paired sentences using LMs. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) have yet to be thoroughly examined in this field. We thus investigate how to make the most of LLMs' grammatical knowledge to comprehensively evaluate it. Through extensive experiments of nine judgment methods in English and Chinese, we demonstrate that a probability readout method, in-template LP, and a prompting-based method, Yes/No probability computing, achieve particularly high performance, surpassing the conventional approach. Our analysis reveals their different strengths, e.g., Yes/No probability computing is robust against token-length bias, suggesting that they harness different aspects of LLMs' grammatical knowledge. Consequently, we recommend using diverse judgment methods to evaluate LLMs comprehensively.</description>

      <title>Exploring Wavelet Transformations for Deep Learning-based Machine Condition Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) strategies have recently been utilized to diagnose motor faults by simply analyzing motor phase current signals, offering a less costly and non-intrusive alternative to vibration sensors. This research transforms these time-series current signals into time-frequency 2D representations via Wavelet Transform (WT). The dataset for motor current signals includes 3,750 data points across five categories: one representing normal conditions and four representing artificially induced faults, each under five different load conditions: 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%. The study employs five WT-based techniques: WT-Amor, WT-Bump, WT-Morse, WSST-Amor, and WSST-Bump. Subsequently, five DL models adopting prior Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture were developed and tested using the transformed 2D plots from each method. The DL models for WT-Amor, WT-Bump, and WT-Morse showed remarkable effectiveness with peak model accuracy of 90.93, 89.20, and 93.73%, respectively, surpassing previous 2D-image-based methods that recorded accuracy of 80.25, 74.80, and 82.80% respectively using the identical dataset and validation protocol. Notably, the WT-Morse approach slightly exceeded the formerly highest ML technique, achieving a 93.20% accuracy. However, the two WSST methods that utilized synchrosqueezing techniques faced difficulty accurately classifying motor faults. The performance of Wavelet-based deep learning methods offers a compelling alternative for machine condition monitoring.</description>

      <title>Debiased Contrastive Representation Learning for Mitigating Dual Biases in Recommender Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recommender systems, popularity and conformity biases undermine recommender effectiveness by disproportionately favouring popular items, leading to their over-representation in recommendation lists and causing an unbalanced distribution of user-item historical data. We construct a causal graph to address both biases and describe the abstract data generation mechanism. Then, we use it as a guide to develop a novel Debiased Contrastive Learning framework for Mitigating Dual Biases, called DCLMDB. In DCLMDB, both popularity bias and conformity bias are handled in the model training process by contrastive learning to ensure that user choices and recommended items are not unduly influenced by conformity and popularity. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, Movielens-10M and Netflix, show that DCLMDB can effectively reduce the dual biases, as well as significantly enhance the accuracy and diversity of recommendations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In motor condition diagnosis, electrical current signature serves as an alternative feature to vibration-based sensor data, which is a more expensive and invasive method. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been emerging in diagnosing motor conditions using only motor phase current signals. This study converts time-series motor current signals to time-frequency 2D plots using Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) methods. The motor current signal dataset consists of 3,750 sample points with five classes - one healthy and four synthetically-applied motor fault conditions, and with five loading conditions: 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%. Five transformation methods are used on the dataset: non-overlap and overlap STFTs, non-overlap and overlap realigned STFTs, and synchrosqueezed STFT. Then, deep learning (DL) models based on the previous Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture are trained and validated from generated plots of each method. The DL models of overlap-STFT, overlap R-STFT, non-overlap STFT, non-overlap R-STFT, and synchrosqueezed-STFT performed exceptionally with an average accuracy of 97.65, 96.03, 96.08, 96.32, and 88.27%, respectively. Four methods outperformed the previous best ML method with 93.20% accuracy, while all five outperformed previous 2D-plot-based methods with accuracy of 80.25, 74.80, and 82.80%, respectively, using the same dataset, same DL architecture, and validation steps.</description>

      <title>ExpoMamba: Exploiting Frequency SSM Blocks for Efficient and Effective Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task in computer vision, with existing state-of-the-art models often limited by hardware constraints and computational inefficiencies, particularly in handling high-resolution images. Recent foundation models, such as transformers and diffusion models, despite their efficacy in various domains, are limited in use on edge devices due to their computational complexity and slow inference times. We introduce ExpoMamba, a novel architecture that integrates components of the frequency state space within a modified U-Net, offering a blend of efficiency and effectiveness. This model is specifically optimized to address mixed exposure challenges, a common issue in low-light image enhancement, while ensuring computational efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that ExpoMamba enhances low-light images up to 2-3x faster than traditional models with an inference time of 36.6 ms and achieves a PSNR improvement of approximately 15-20% over competing models, making it highly suitable for real-time image processing applications.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Conditional Instrumental Variables for Debiasing Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recommender systems, latent variables can cause user-item interaction data to deviate from true user preferences. This biased data is then used to train recommendation models, further amplifying the bias and ultimately compromising both recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction. Instrumental Variable (IV) methods are effective tools for addressing the confounding bias introduced by latent variables; however, identifying a valid IV is often challenging. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel data-driven conditional IV (CIV) debiasing method for recommender systems, called CIV4Rec. CIV4Rec automatically generates valid CIVs and their corresponding conditioning sets directly from interaction data, significantly reducing the complexity of IV selection while effectively mitigating the confounding bias caused by latent variables in recommender systems. Specifically, CIV4Rec leverages a variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate the representations of the CIV and its conditional set from interaction data, followed by the application of least squares to derive causal representations for click prediction. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, Movielens-10M and Douban-Movie, demonstrate that our CIV4Rec successfully identifies valid CIVs, effectively reduces bias, and consequently improves recommendation accuracy.</description>

      <title>MambaLoc: Efficient Camera Localisation via State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Location information is pivotal for the automation and intelligence of terminal devices and edge-cloud IoT systems, such as autonomous vehicles and augmented reality. However, achieving reliable positioning across diverse IoT applications remains challenging due to significant training costs and the necessity of densely collected data. To tackle these issues, we have innovatively applied the selective state space (SSM) model to visual localization, introducing a new model named MambaLoc. The proposed model demonstrates exceptional training efficiency by capitalizing on the SSM model's strengths in efficient feature extraction, rapid computation, and memory optimization, and it further ensures robustness in sparse data environments due to its parameter sparsity. Additionally, we propose the Global Information Selector (GIS), which leverages selective SSM to implicitly achieve the efficient global feature extraction capabilities of Non-local Neural Networks. This design leverages the computational efficiency of the SSM model alongside the Non-local Neural Networks' capacity to capture long-range dependencies with minimal layers. Consequently, the GIS enables effective global information capture while significantly accelerating convergence. Our extensive experimental validation using public indoor and outdoor datasets first demonstrates our model's effectiveness, followed by evidence of its versatility with various existing localization models.</description>

      <title>LightWeather: Harnessing Absolute Positional Encoding to Efficient and Scalable Global Weather Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Transformers have gained traction in weather forecasting for their capability to capture long-term spatial-temporal correlations. However, their complex architectures result in large parameter counts and extended training times, limiting their practical application and scalability to global-scale forecasting. This paper aims to explore the key factor for accurate weather forecasting and design more efficient solutions. Interestingly, our empirical findings reveal that absolute positional encoding is what really works in Transformer-based weather forecasting models, which can explicitly model the spatial-temporal correlations even without attention mechanisms. We theoretically prove that its effectiveness stems from the integration of geographical coordinates and real-world time features, which are intrinsically related to the dynamics of weather. Based on this, we propose LightWeather, a lightweight and effective model for station-based global weather forecasting. We employ absolute positional encoding and a simple MLP in place of other components of Transformer. With under 30k parameters and less than one hour of training time, LightWeather achieves state-of-the-art performance on global weather datasets compared to other advanced DL methods. The results underscore the superiority of integrating spatial-temporal knowledge over complex architectures, providing novel insights for DL in weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Multimodal Large Language Models for Multimodal Sequential Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the field of Recommendation Systems (RSs). Most existing studies have focused on converting user behavior logs into textual prompts and leveraging techniques such as prompt tuning to enable LLMs for recommendation tasks. Meanwhile, research interest has recently grown in multimodal recommendation systems that integrate data from images, text, and other sources using modality fusion techniques. This introduces new challenges to the existing LLM-based recommendation paradigm which relies solely on text modality information. Moreover, although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) capable of processing multi-modal inputs have emerged, how to equip MLLMs with multi-modal recommendation capabilities remains largely unexplored. To this end, in this paper, we propose the Multimodal Large Language Model-enhanced Sequential Multimodal Recommendation (MLLM-MSR) model. To capture the dynamic user preference, we design a two-stage user preference summarization method. Specifically, we first utilize an MLLM-based item-summarizer to extract image feature given an item and convert the image into text. Then, we employ a recurrent user preference summarization generation paradigm to capture the dynamic changes in user preferences based on an LLM-based user-summarizer. Finally, to enable the MLLM for multi-modal recommendation task, we propose to fine-tune a MLLM-based recommender using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) techniques. Extensive evaluations across various datasets validate the effectiveness of MLLM-MSR, showcasing its superior ability to capture and adapt to the evolving dynamics of user preferences.</description>

      <title>Photorealistic Object Insertion with Diffusion-Guided Inverse Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correct insertion of virtual objects in images of real-world scenes requires a deep understanding of the scene's lighting, geometry and materials, as well as the image formation process. While recent large-scale diffusion models have shown strong generative and inpainting capabilities, we find that current models do not sufficiently "understand" the scene shown in a single picture to generate consistent lighting effects (shadows, bright reflections, etc.) while preserving the identity and details of the composited object. We propose using a personalized large diffusion model as guidance to a physically based inverse rendering process. Our method recovers scene lighting and tone-mapping parameters, allowing the photorealistic composition of arbitrary virtual objects in single frames or videos of indoor or outdoor scenes. Our physically based pipeline further enables automatic materials and tone-mapping refinement.</description>

      <title>Pedestrian Attribute Recognition: A New Benchmark Dataset and A Large Language Model Augmented Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is one of the indispensable tasks in human-centered research. However, existing datasets neglect different domains (e.g., environments, times, populations, and data sources), only conducting simple random splits, and the performance of these datasets has already approached saturation. In the past five years, no large-scale dataset has been opened to the public. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new large-scale, cross-domain pedestrian attribute recognition dataset to fill the data gap, termed MSP60K. It consists of 60,122 images and 57 attribute annotations across eight scenarios. Synthetic degradation is also conducted to further narrow the gap between the dataset and real-world challenging scenarios. To establish a more rigorous benchmark, we evaluate 17 representative PAR models under both random and cross-domain split protocols on our dataset. Additionally, we propose an innovative Large Language Model (LLM) augmented PAR framework, named LLM-PAR. This framework processes pedestrian images through a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone to extract features and introduces a multi-embedding query Transformer to learn partial-aware features for attribute classification. Significantly, we enhance this framework with LLM for ensemble learning and visual feature augmentation. Comprehensive experiments across multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly validated the efficacy of our proposed framework. The dataset and source code accompanying this paper will be made publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenPAR}.</description>

      <title>Mutually-Aware Feature Learning for Few-Shot Object Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-shot object counting has garnered significant attention for its practicality as it aims to count target objects in a query image based on given exemplars without the need for additional training. However, there is a shortcoming in the prevailing extract-and-match approach: query and exemplar features lack interaction during feature extraction since they are extracted unaware of each other and later correlated based on similarity. This can lead to insufficient target awareness of the extracted features, resulting in target confusion in precisely identifying the actual target when multiple class objects coexist. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, Mutually-Aware FEAture learning(MAFEA), which encodes query and exemplar features mutually aware of each other from the outset. By encouraging interaction between query and exemplar features throughout the entire pipeline, we can obtain target-aware features that are robust to a multi-category scenario. Furthermore, we introduce a background token to effectively associate the target region of query with exemplars and decouple its background region from them. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our model reaches a new state-of-the-art performance on the two challenging benchmarks, FSCD-LVIS and FSC-147, with a remarkably reduced degree of the target confusion problem.</description>

      <title>Paired Completion: Flexible Quantification of Issue-framing at Scale with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting and quantifying issue framing in textual discourse - the perspective one takes to a given topic (e.g. climate science vs. denialism, misogyny vs. gender equality) - is highly valuable to a range of end-users from social and political scientists to program evaluators and policy analysts. However, conceptual framing is notoriously challenging for automated natural language processing (NLP) methods since the words and phrases used by either `side' of an issue are often held in common, with only subtle stylistic flourishes separating their use. Here we develop and rigorously evaluate new detection methods for issue framing and narrative analysis within large text datasets. By introducing a novel application of next-token log probabilities derived from generative large language models (LLMs) we show that issue framing can be reliably and efficiently detected in large corpora with only a few examples of either perspective on a given issue, a method we call `paired completion'. Through 192 independent experiments over three novel, synthetic datasets, we evaluate paired completion against prompt-based LLM methods and labelled methods using traditional NLP and recent LLM contextual embeddings. We additionally conduct a cost-based analysis to mark out the feasible set of performant methods at production-level scales, and a model bias analysis. Together, our work demonstrates a feasible path to scalable, accurate and low-bias issue-framing in large corpora.</description>

      <title>R2GenCSR: Retrieving Context Samples for Large Language Model based X-ray Medical Report Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the tremendous success of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing X-ray medical report generation methods attempt to leverage large models to achieve better performance. They usually adopt a Transformer to extract the visual features of a given X-ray image, and then, feed them into the LLM for text generation. How to extract more effective information for the LLMs to help them improve final results is an urgent problem that needs to be solved. Additionally, the use of visual Transformer models also brings high computational complexity. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel context-guided efficient X-ray medical report generation framework. Specifically, we introduce the Mamba as the vision backbone with linear complexity, and the performance obtained is comparable to that of the strong Transformer model. More importantly, we perform context retrieval from the training set for samples within each mini-batch during the training phase, utilizing both positively and negatively related samples to enhance feature representation and discriminative learning. Subsequently, we feed the vision tokens, context information, and prompt statements to invoke the LLM for generating high-quality medical reports. Extensive experiments on three X-ray report generation datasets (i.e., IU-Xray, MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert Plus) fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed model. The source code of this work will be released on \url{https://github.com/Event-AHU/Medical_Image_Analysis}.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Cascade Prostate Cancer Classifier in mp-MRI Utilizing Recall Feedback Adaptive Loss and Prior Knowledge-Based Feature Extraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in males worldwide, and mpMRI is commonly used for diagnosis. However, interpreting mpMRI is challenging and requires expertise from radiologists. This highlights the urgent need for automated grading in mpMRI. Existing studies lack integration of clinical prior information and suffer from uneven training sample distribution due to prevalence. Therefore, we propose a solution that incorporates prior knowledge, addresses the issue of uneven medical sample distribution, and maintains high interpretability in mpMRI. Firstly, we introduce Prior Knowledge-Based Feature Extraction, which mathematically models the PI-RADS criteria for prostate cancer as diagnostic information into model training. Secondly, we propose Adaptive Recall Feedback Loss to address the extremely imbalanced data problem. This method adjusts the training dynamically based on accuracy and recall in the validation set, resulting in high accuracy and recall simultaneously in the testing set.Thirdly, we design an Enhanced Cascade Prostate Cancer Classifier that classifies prostate cancer into different levels in an interpretable way, which refines the classification results and helps with clinical intervention. Our method is validated through experiments on the PI-CAI dataset and outperforms other methods with a more balanced result in both accuracy and recall rate.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Reciprocal Recommender Systems: Metrics, Formulation, and Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reciprocal recommender systems~(RRS), conducting bilateral recommendations between two involved parties, have gained increasing attention for enhancing matching efficiency. However, the majority of existing methods in the literature still reuse conventional ranking metrics to separately assess the performance on each side of the recommendation process. These methods overlook the fact that the ranking outcomes of both sides collectively influence the effectiveness of the RRS, neglecting the necessity of a more holistic evaluation and a capable systemic solution.
  In this paper, we systemically revisit the task of reciprocal recommendation, by introducing the new metrics, formulation, and method. Firstly, we propose five new evaluation metrics that comprehensively and accurately assess the performance of RRS from three distinct perspectives: overall coverage, bilateral stability, and balanced ranking. These metrics provide a more holistic understanding of the system's effectiveness and enable a comprehensive evaluation. Furthermore, we formulate the RRS from a causal perspective, formulating recommendations as bilateral interventions, which can better model the decoupled effects of potential influencing factors. By utilizing the potential outcome framework, we further develop a model-agnostic causal reciprocal recommendation method that considers the causal effects of recommendations. Additionally, we introduce a reranking strategy to maximize matching outcomes, as measured by the proposed metrics. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets from recruitment and dating scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed metrics and approach.

      <title>Event Stream based Human Action Recognition: A High-Definition Benchmark Dataset and Algorithms</title>

Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) stands as a pivotal research domain in both computer vision and artificial intelligence, with RGB cameras dominating as the preferred tool for investigation and innovation in this field. However, in real-world applications, RGB cameras encounter numerous challenges, including light conditions, fast motion, and privacy concerns. Consequently, bio-inspired event cameras have garnered increasing attention due to their advantages of low energy consumption, high dynamic range, etc. Nevertheless, most existing event-based HAR datasets are low resolution ($346 \times 260$). In this paper, we propose a large-scale, high-definition ($1280 \times 800$) human action recognition dataset based on the CeleX-V event camera, termed CeleX-HAR. It encompasses 150 commonly occurring action categories, comprising a total of 124,625 video sequences. Various factors such as multi-view, illumination, action speed, and occlusion are considered when recording these data. To build a more comprehensive benchmark dataset, we report over 20 mainstream HAR models for future works to compare. In addition, we also propose a novel Mamba vision backbone network for event stream based HAR, termed EVMamba, which equips the spatial plane multi-directional scanning and novel voxel temporal scanning mechanism. By encoding and mining the spatio-temporal information of event streams, our EVMamba has achieved favorable results across multiple datasets. Both the dataset and source code will be released on \url{https://github.com/Event-AHU/CeleX-HAR}</description>

      <title>Propagating the prior from shallow to deep with a pre-trained velocity-model Generative Transformer network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building subsurface velocity models is essential to our goals in utilizing seismic data for Earth discovery and exploration, as well as monitoring. With the dawn of machine learning, these velocity models (or, more precisely, their distribution) can be stored accurately and efficiently in a generative model. These stored velocity model distributions can be utilized to regularize or quantify uncertainties in inverse problems, like full waveform inversion. However, most generators, like normalizing flows or diffusion models, treat the image (velocity model) uniformly, disregarding spatial dependencies and resolution changes with respect to the observation locations. To address this weakness, we introduce VelocityGPT, a novel implementation that utilizes Transformer decoders trained autoregressively to generate a velocity model from shallow subsurface to deep. Owing to the fact that seismic data are often recorded on the Earth's surface, a top-down generator can utilize the inverted information in the shallow as guidance (prior) to generating the deep. To facilitate the implementation, we use an additional network to compress the velocity model. We also inject prior information, like well or structure (represented by a migration image) to generate the velocity model. Using synthetic data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of VelocityGPT as a promising approach in generative model applications for seismic velocity model building.</description>

      <title>Contextual Dual Learning Algorithm with Listwise Distillation for Unbiased Learning to Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unbiased Learning to Rank (ULTR) aims to leverage biased implicit user feedback (e.g., click) to optimize an unbiased ranking model. The effectiveness of the existing ULTR methods has primarily been validated on synthetic datasets. However, their performance on real-world click data remains unclear. Recently, Baidu released a large publicly available dataset of their web search logs. Subsequently, the NTCIR-17 ULTRE-2 task released a subset dataset extracted from it. We conduct experiments on commonly used or effective ULTR methods on this subset to determine whether they maintain their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a Contextual Dual Learning Algorithm with Listwise Distillation (CDLA-LD) to simultaneously address both position bias and contextual bias. We utilize a listwise-input ranking model to obtain reconstructed feature vectors incorporating local contextual information and employ the Dual Learning Algorithm (DLA) method to jointly train this ranking model and a propensity model to address position bias. As this ranking model learns the interaction information within the documents list of the training set, to enhance the ranking model's generalization ability, we additionally train a pointwise-input ranking model to learn the listwise-input ranking model's capability for relevance judgment in a listwise manner. Extensive experiments and analysis confirm the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>CMoralEval: A Moral Evaluation Benchmark for Chinese Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What a large language model (LLM) would respond in ethically relevant context? In this paper, we curate a large benchmark CMoralEval for morality evaluation of Chinese LLMs. The data sources of CMoralEval are two-fold: 1) a Chinese TV program discussing Chinese moral norms with stories from the society and 2) a collection of Chinese moral anomies from various newspapers and academic papers on morality. With these sources, we aim to create a moral evaluation dataset characterized by diversity and authenticity. We develop a morality taxonomy and a set of fundamental moral principles that are not only rooted in traditional Chinese culture but also consistent with contemporary societal norms. To facilitate efficient construction and annotation of instances in CMoralEval, we establish a platform with AI-assisted instance generation to streamline the annotation process. These help us curate CMoralEval that encompasses both explicit moral scenarios (14,964 instances) and moral dilemma scenarios (15,424 instances), each with instances from different data sources. We conduct extensive experiments with CMoralEval to examine a variety of Chinese LLMs. Experiment results demonstrate that CMoralEval is a challenging benchmark for Chinese LLMs. The dataset is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/tjunlp-lab/CMoralEval}.</description>

      <title>Segment-Anything Models Achieve Zero-shot Robustness in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a significant perception task in autonomous driving. It suffers from the risks of adversarial examples. In the past few years, deep learning has gradually transitioned from convolutional neural network (CNN) models with a relatively small number of parameters to foundation models with a huge number of parameters. The segment-anything model (SAM) is a generalized image segmentation framework that is capable of handling various types of images and is able to recognize and segment arbitrary objects in an image without the need to train on a specific object. It is a unified model that can handle diverse downstream tasks, including semantic segmentation, object detection, and tracking. In the task of semantic segmentation for autonomous driving, it is significant to study the zero-shot adversarial robustness of SAM. Therefore, we deliver a systematic empirical study on the robustness of SAM without additional training. Based on the experimental results, the zero-shot adversarial robustness of the SAM under the black-box corruptions and white-box adversarial attacks is acceptable, even without the need for additional training. The finding of this study is insightful in that the gigantic model parameters and huge amounts of training data lead to the phenomenon of emergence, which builds a guarantee of adversarial robustness. SAM is a vision foundation model that can be regarded as an early prototype of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) pipeline. In such a pipeline, a unified model can handle diverse tasks. Therefore, this research not only inspects the impact of vision foundation models on safe autonomous driving but also provides a perspective on developing trustworthy AGI.

      <title>Importance Weighting Can Help Large Language Models Self-Improve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capability in numerous tasks and applications. However, fine-tuning LLMs using high-quality datasets under external supervision remains prohibitively expensive. In response, LLM self-improvement approaches have been vibrantly developed recently. The typical paradigm of LLM self-improvement involves training LLM on self-generated data, part of which may be detrimental and should be filtered out due to the unstable data quality. While current works primarily employs filtering strategies based on answer correctness, in this paper, we demonstrate that filtering out correct but with high distribution shift extent (DSE) samples could also benefit the results of self-improvement. Given that the actual sample distribution is usually inaccessible, we propose a new metric called DS weight to approximate DSE, inspired by the Importance Weighting methods. Consequently, we integrate DS weight with self-consistency to comprehensively filter the self-generated samples and fine-tune the language model. Experiments show that with only a tiny valid set (up to 5\% size of the training set) to compute DS weight, our approach can notably promote the reasoning ability of current LLM self-improvement methods. The resulting performance is on par with methods that rely on external supervision from pre-trained reward models.</description>

      <title>Self-Directed Turing Test for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Turing test examines whether AIs can exhibit human-like behaviour in natural language conversations. Traditional Turing tests adopt a rigid dialogue format where each participant sends only one message each time and require continuous human involvement to direct the entire interaction with the test subject. This fails to reflect a natural conversational style and hinders the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex and prolonged dialogues. This paper proposes the Self-Directed Turing Test, which extends the original test with a burst dialogue format, allowing more dynamic exchanges by multiple consecutive messages. It further efficiently reduces human workload by having the LLM self-direct the majority of the test process, iteratively generating dialogues that simulate its interaction with humans. With the pseudo-dialogue history, the model then engages in a shorter dialogue with a human, which is paired with a human-human conversation on the same topic to be judged using questionnaires. We introduce the X-Turn Pass-Rate metric to assess the human likeness of LLMs across varying durations. While LLMs like GPT-4 initially perform well, achieving pass rates of 51.9% and 38.9% during 3 turns and 10 turns of dialogues respectively, their performance drops as the dialogue progresses, which underscores the difficulty in maintaining consistency in the long term.</description>

      <title>TeamLoRA: Boosting Low-Rank Adaptation with Expert Collaboration and Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA have effectively addressed GPU memory constraints during fine-tuning, their performance often falls short, especially in multidimensional task scenarios. To address this issue, one straightforward solution is to introduce task-specific LoRA modules as domain experts, leveraging the modeling of multiple experts' capabilities and thus enhancing the general capability of multi-task learning. Despite promising, these additional components often add complexity to the training and inference process, contravening the efficient characterization of PEFT designed for. Considering this, we introduce an innovative PEFT method, TeamLoRA, consisting of a collaboration and competition module for experts, and thus achieving the right balance of effectiveness and efficiency: (i) For collaboration, a novel knowledge-sharing and -organizing mechanism is devised to appropriately reduce the scale of matrix operations, thereby boosting the training and inference speed. (ii) For competition, we propose leveraging a game-theoretic interaction mechanism for experts, encouraging experts to transfer their domain-specific knowledge while facing diverse downstream tasks, and thus enhancing the performance. By doing so, TeamLoRA elegantly connects the experts as a "Team" with internal collaboration and competition, enabling a faster and more accurate PEFT paradigm for multi-task learning. To validate the superiority of TeamLoRA, we curate a comprehensive multi-task evaluation(CME) benchmark to thoroughly assess the capability of multi-task learning. Experiments conducted on our CME and other benchmarks indicate the effectiveness and efficiency of TeamLoRA. Our project is available at https://github.com/Lin-Tianwei/TeamLoRA.</description>

      <title>3D-Aware Instance Segmentation and Tracking in Egocentric Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Egocentric videos present unique challenges for 3D scene understanding due to rapid camera motion, frequent object occlusions, and limited object visibility. This paper introduces a novel approach to instance segmentation and tracking in first-person video that leverages 3D awareness to overcome these obstacles. Our method integrates scene geometry, 3D object centroid tracking, and instance segmentation to create a robust framework for analyzing dynamic egocentric scenes. By incorporating spatial and temporal cues, we achieve superior performance compared to state-of-the-art 2D approaches. Extensive evaluations on the challenging EPIC Fields dataset demonstrate significant improvements across a range of tracking and segmentation consistency metrics. Specifically, our method outperforms the next best performing approach by $7$ points in Association Accuracy (AssA) and $4.5$ points in IDF1 score, while reducing the number of ID switches by $73\%$ to $80\%$ across various object categories. Leveraging our tracked instance segmentations, we showcase downstream applications in 3D object reconstruction and amodal video object segmentation in these egocentric settings.</description>

      <title>New spectral imaging biomarkers for sepsis and mortality in intensive care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With sepsis remaining a leading cause of mortality, early identification of septic patients and those at high risk of death is a challenge of high socioeconomic importance. The driving hypothesis of this study was that hyperspectral imaging (HSI) could provide novel biomarkers for sepsis diagnosis and treatment management due to its potential to monitor microcirculatory alterations. We conducted a comprehensive study involving HSI data of the palm and fingers from more than 480 patients on the day of their intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The findings demonstrate that HSI measurements can predict sepsis with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.80 (95 % confidence interval (CI) [0.76; 0.84]) and mortality with an AUROC of 0.72 (95 % CI [0.65; 0.79]). The predictive performance improves substantially when additional clinical data is incorporated, leading to an AUROC of up to 0.94 (95 % CI [0.92; 0.96]) for sepsis and 0.84 (95 % CI [0.78; 0.89]) for mortality. We conclude that HSI presents novel imaging biomarkers for the rapid, non-invasive prediction of sepsis and mortality, suggesting its potential as an important modality for guiding diagnosis and treatment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the SZU-AFS anti-spoofing system, designed for Track 1 of the ASVspoof 5 Challenge under open conditions. The system is built with four stages: selecting a baseline model, exploring effective data augmentation (DA) methods for fine-tuning, applying a co-enhancement strategy based on gradient norm aware minimization (GAM) for secondary fine-tuning, and fusing logits scores from the two best-performing fine-tuned models. The system utilizes the Wav2Vec2 front-end feature extractor and the AASIST back-end classifier as the baseline model. During model fine-tuning, three distinct DA policies have been investigated: single-DA, random-DA, and cascade-DA. Moreover, the employed GAM-based co-enhancement strategy, designed to fine-tune the augmented model at both data and optimizer levels, helps the Adam optimizer find flatter minima, thereby boosting model generalization. Overall, the final fusion system achieves a minDCF of 0.115 and an EER of 4.04% on the evaluation set.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking LLMs for Translating Classical Chinese Poetry:Evaluating Adequacy, Fluency, and Elegance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in general translation tasks. However, the increasing demand for high-quality translations that are not only adequate but also fluent and elegant. To assess the extent to which current LLMs can meet these demands, we introduce a suitable benchmark for translating classical Chinese poetry into English. This task requires not only adequacy in translating culturally and historically significant content but also a strict adherence to linguistic fluency and poetic elegance. Our study reveals that existing LLMs fall short of this task. To address these issues, we propose RAT, a \textbf{R}etrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented machine \textbf{T}ranslation method that enhances the translation process by incorporating knowledge related to classical poetry. Additionally, we propose an automatic evaluation metric based on GPT-4, which better assesses translation quality in terms of adequacy, fluency, and elegance, overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Our dataset and code will be made available.</description>

Abstract: Understanding human attention is crucial for vision science and AI. While many models exist for free-viewing, less is known about task-driven image exploration. To address this, we introduce CapMIT1003, a dataset with captions and click-contingent image explorations, to study human attention during the captioning task. We also present NevaClip, a zero-shot method for predicting visual scanpaths by combining CLIP models with NeVA algorithms. NevaClip generates fixations to align the representations of foveated visual stimuli and captions. The simulated scanpaths outperform existing human attention models in plausibility for captioning and free-viewing tasks. This research enhances the understanding of human attention and advances scanpath prediction models.</description>

      <title>AdaResNet: Enhancing Residual Networks with Dynamic Weight Adjustment for Improved Feature Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In very deep neural networks, gradients can become extremely small during backpropagation, making it challenging to train the early layers. ResNet (Residual Network) addresses this issue by enabling gradients to flow directly through the network via skip connections, facilitating the training of much deeper networks. However, in these skip connections, the input ipd is directly added to the transformed data tfd, treating ipd and tfd equally, without adapting to different scenarios. In this paper, we propose AdaResNet (Auto-Adapting Residual Network), which automatically adjusts the ratio between ipd and tfd based on the training data. We introduce a variable, weight}_{tfd}^{ipd, to represent this ratio. This variable is dynamically adjusted during backpropagation, allowing it to adapt to the training data rather than remaining fixed. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaResNet achieves a maximum accuracy improvement of over 50\% compared to traditional ResNet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid approach that integrates linear programming (LP) within the loss function of an unsupervised machine learning model. By leveraging the strengths of both optimization techniques and machine learning, this method introduces a robust framework for solving complex optimization problems where traditional methods may fall short. The proposed approach encapsulates the constraints and objectives of a linear programming problem directly into the loss function, guiding the learning process to adhere to these constraints while optimizing the desired outcomes. This technique not only preserves the interpretability of linear programming but also benefits from the flexibility and adaptability of machine learning, making it particularly well-suited for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into autonomous driving enhances personalization and adaptability in open-world scenarios. However, traditional edge computing models still face significant challenges in processing complex driving data, particularly regarding real-time performance and system efficiency. To address these challenges, this study introduces EC-Drive, a novel edge-cloud collaborative autonomous driving system with data drift detection capabilities. EC-Drive utilizes drift detection algorithms to selectively upload critical data, including new obstacles and traffic pattern changes, to the cloud for processing by GPT-4, while routine data is efficiently managed by smaller LLMs on edge devices. This approach not only reduces inference latency but also improves system efficiency by optimizing communication resource use. Experimental validation confirms the system's robust processing capabilities and practical applicability in real-world driving conditions, demonstrating the effectiveness of this edge-cloud collaboration framework. Our data and system demonstration will be released at https://sites.google.com/view/ec-drive.</description>

      <title>Facial Wrinkle Segmentation for Cosmetic Dermatology: Pretraining with Texture Map-Based Weak Supervision</title>

Abstract: Facial wrinkle detection plays a crucial role in cosmetic dermatology. Precise manual segmentation of facial wrinkles is challenging and time-consuming, with inherent subjectivity leading to inconsistent results among graders. To address this issue, we propose two solutions. First, we build and release the first public facial wrinkle dataset, `FFHQ-Wrinkle', an extension of the NVIDIA FFHQ dataset. This dataset includes 1,000 images with human labels and 50,000 images with automatically generated weak labels. This dataset can foster the research community to develop advanced wrinkle detection algorithms. Second, we introduce a training strategy for U-Net-like encoder-decoder models to detect wrinkles across the face automatically. Our method employs a two-stage training strategy: texture map pretraining and finetuning on human-labeled data. Initially, we pretrain models on a large dataset with weak labels (N=50k) or masked texture maps generated through computer vision techniques, without human intervention. Subsequently, we finetune the models using human-labeled data (N=1k), which consists of manually labeled wrinkle masks. During finetuning, the network inputs a combination of RGB and masked texture maps, comprising four channels. We effectively combine labels from multiple annotators to minimize subjectivity in manual labeling. Our strategies demonstrate improved segmentation performance in facial wrinkle segmentation both quantitatively and visually compared to existing pretraining methods.</description>

      <title>FFAA: Multimodal Large Language Model based Explainable Open-World Face Forgery Analysis Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of deepfake technologies has sparked widespread public concern, particularly as face forgery poses a serious threat to public information security. However, the unknown and diverse forgery techniques, varied facial features and complex environmental factors pose significant challenges for face forgery analysis. Existing datasets lack descriptions of these aspects, making it difficult for models to distinguish between real and forged faces using only visual information amid various confounding factors. In addition, existing methods do not yield user-friendly and explainable results, complicating the understanding of the model's decision-making process. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Open-World Face Forgery Analysis VQA (OW-FFA-VQA) task and the corresponding benchmark. To tackle this task, we first establish a dataset featuring a diverse collection of real and forged face images with essential descriptions and reliable forgery reasoning. Base on this dataset, we introduce FFAA: Face Forgery Analysis Assistant, consisting of a fine-tuned Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and Multi-answer Intelligent Decision System (MIDS). By integrating hypothetical prompts with MIDS, the impact of fuzzy classification boundaries is effectively mitigated, enhancing the model's robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only provides user-friendly explainable results but also significantly boosts accuracy and robustness compared to previous methods.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Reward Machines for Multi-Agent Equilibrium Design (Full Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanism design is a well-established game-theoretic paradigm for designing games to achieve desired outcomes. This paper addresses a closely related but distinct concept, equilibrium design. Unlike mechanism design, the designer's authority in equilibrium design is more constrained; she can only modify the incentive structures in a given game to achieve certain outcomes without the ability to create the game from scratch. We study the problem of equilibrium design using dynamic incentive structures, known as reward machines. We use weighted concurrent game structures for the game model, with goals (for the players and the designer) defined as mean-payoff objectives. We show how reward machines can be used to represent dynamic incentives that allocate rewards in a manner that optimises the designer's goal. We also introduce the main decision problem within our framework, the payoff improvement problem. This problem essentially asks whether there exists a dynamic incentive (represented by some reward machine) that can improve the designer's payoff by more than a given threshold value. We present two variants of the problem: strong and weak. We demonstrate that both can be solved in polynomial time using a Turing machine equipped with an NP oracle. Furthermore, we also establish that these variants are either NP-hard or coNP-hard. Finally, we show how to synthesise the corresponding reward machine if it exists.</description>

      <title>Personalizing Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with Variational Preference Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a powerful paradigm for aligning foundation models to human values and preferences. However, current RLHF techniques cannot account for the naturally occurring differences in individual human preferences across a diverse population. When these differences arise, traditional RLHF frameworks simply average over them, leading to inaccurate rewards and poor performance for individual subgroups. To address the need for pluralistic alignment, we develop a class of multimodal RLHF methods. Our proposed techniques are based on a latent variable formulation - inferring a novel user-specific latent and learning reward models and policies conditioned on this latent without additional user-specific data. While conceptually simple, we show that in practice, this reward modeling requires careful algorithmic considerations around model architecture and reward scaling. To empirically validate our proposed technique, we first show that it can provide a way to combat underspecification in simulated control problems, inferring and optimizing user-specific reward functions. Next, we conduct experiments on pluralistic language datasets representing diverse user preferences and demonstrate improved reward function accuracy. We additionally show the benefits of this probabilistic framework in terms of measuring uncertainty, and actively learning user preferences. This work enables learning from diverse populations of users with divergent preferences, an important challenge that naturally occurs in problems from robot learning to foundation model alignment.</description>

      <title>No Screening is More Efficient with Multiple Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study efficient mechanism design for allocating multiple heterogeneous objects. We aim to maximize the residual surplus, the total value generated from an allocation minus the costs for screening agents' values. We discover a robust trend indicating that no-screening mechanisms such as serial dictatorship with exogenous priority order tend to perform better as the variety of goods increases. We analyze the underlying reasons by characterizing efficient mechanisms in a stylized environment. We also apply an automated mechanism design approach to numerically derive efficient mechanisms and validate the trend in general environments. Building on this implication, we propose the register-invite-book system (RIB) as an efficient system for scheduling vaccination against pandemic diseases.</description>

      <title>Convert and Speak: Zero-shot Accent Conversion with Minimum Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low resource of parallel data is the key challenge of accent conversion(AC) problem in which both the pronunciation units and prosody pattern need to be converted. We propose a two-stage generative framework "convert-and-speak" in which the conversion is only operated on the semantic token level and the speech is synthesized conditioned on the converted semantic token with a speech generative model in target accent domain. The decoupling design enables the "speaking" module to use massive amount of target accent speech and relieves the parallel data required for the "conversion" module. Conversion with the bridge of semantic token also relieves the requirement for the data with text transcriptions and unlocks the usage of language pre-training technology to further efficiently reduce the need of parallel accent speech data. To reduce the complexity and latency of "speaking", a single-stage AR generative model is designed to achieve good quality as well as lower computation cost. Experiments on Indian-English to general American-English conversion show that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in accent similarity, speech quality, and speaker maintenance with only 15 minutes of weakly parallel data which is not constrained to the same speaker. Extensive experimentation with diverse accent types suggests that this framework possesses a high degree of adaptability, making it readily scalable to accommodate other accents with low-resource data. Audio samples are available at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/convert-and-speak-zero-shot-accent-conversion-with-minimumsupervision/.</description>

      <title>Perturb-and-Compare Approach for Detecting Out-of-Distribution Samples in Constrained Access Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accessing machine learning models through remote APIs has been gaining prevalence following the recent trend of scaling up model parameters for increased performance. Even though these models exhibit remarkable ability, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples remains a crucial safety concern for end users as these samples may induce unreliable outputs from the model. In this work, we propose an OOD detection framework, MixDiff, that is applicable even when the model's parameters or its activations are not accessible to the end user. To bypass the access restriction, MixDiff applies an identical input-level perturbation to a given target sample and a similar in-distribution (ID) sample, then compares the relative difference in the model outputs of these two samples. MixDiff is model-agnostic and compatible with existing output-based OOD detection methods. We provide theoretical analysis to illustrate MixDiff's effectiveness in discerning OOD samples that induce overconfident outputs from the model and empirically demonstrate that MixDiff consistently enhances the OOD detection performance on various datasets in vision and text domains.</description>

      <title>Envisioning Possibilities and Challenges of AI for Personalized Cancer Care</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, including in caring for cancer survivors, has gained significant interest. However, gaps remain in our understanding of how such AI systems can provide care, especially for ethnic and racial minority groups who continue to face care disparities. Through interviews with six cancer survivors, we identify critical gaps in current healthcare systems such as a lack of personalized care and insufficient cultural and linguistic accommodation. AI, when applied to care, was seen as a way to address these issues by enabling real-time, culturally aligned, and linguistically appropriate interactions. We also uncovered concerns about the implications of AI-driven personalization, such as data privacy, loss of human touch in caregiving, and the risk of echo chambers that limit exposure to diverse information. We conclude by discussing the trade-offs between AI-enhanced personalization and the need for structural changes in healthcare that go beyond technological solutions, leading us to argue that we should begin by asking, ``Why personalization?''</description>

      <title>Factorized-Dreamer: Training A High-Quality Video Generator with Limited and Low-Quality Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has gained significant attention due to its wide applications to video generation, editing, enhancement and translation, \etc. However, high-quality (HQ) video synthesis is extremely challenging because of the diverse and complex motions existed in real world. Most existing works struggle to address this problem by collecting large-scale HQ videos, which are inaccessible to the community. In this work, we show that publicly available limited and low-quality (LQ) data are sufficient to train a HQ video generator without recaptioning or finetuning. We factorize the whole T2V generation process into two steps: generating an image conditioned on a highly descriptive caption, and synthesizing the video conditioned on the generated image and a concise caption of motion details. Specifically, we present \emph{Factorized-Dreamer}, a factorized spatiotemporal framework with several critical designs for T2V generation, including an adapter to combine text and image embeddings, a pixel-aware cross attention module to capture pixel-level image information, a T5 text encoder to better understand motion description, and a PredictNet to supervise optical flows. We further present a noise schedule, which plays a key role in ensuring the quality and stability of video generation. Our model lowers the requirements in detailed captions and HQ videos, and can be directly trained on limited LQ datasets with noisy and brief captions such as WebVid-10M, largely alleviating the cost to collect large-scale HQ video-text pairs. Extensive experiments in a variety of T2V and image-to-video generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Factorized-Dreamer.

      <title>Molecular Graph Representation Learning Integrating Large Language Models with Domain-specific Small Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a crucial foundation for drug discovery. In recent years, pre-trained deep learning models have been widely applied to this task. Some approaches that incorporate prior biological domain knowledge into the pre-training framework have achieved impressive results. However, these methods heavily rely on biochemical experts, and retrieving and summarizing vast amounts of domain knowledge literature is both time-consuming and expensive. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in understanding and efficiently providing general knowledge. Nevertheless, they occasionally exhibit hallucinations and lack precision in generating domain-specific knowledge. Conversely, Domain-specific Small Models (DSMs) possess rich domain knowledge and can accurately calculate molecular domain-related metrics. However, due to their limited model size and singular functionality, they lack the breadth of knowledge necessary for comprehensive representation learning. To leverage the advantages of both approaches in molecular property prediction, we propose a novel Molecular Graph representation learning framework that integrates Large language models and Domain-specific small models (MolGraph-LarDo). Technically, we design a two-stage prompt strategy where DSMs are introduced to calibrate the knowledge provided by LLMs, enhancing the accuracy of domain-specific information and thus enabling LLMs to generate more precise textual descriptions for molecular samples. Subsequently, we employ a multi-modal alignment method to coordinate various modalities, including molecular graphs and their corresponding descriptive texts, to guide the pre-training of molecular representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Advancing Voice Cloning for Nepali: Leveraging Transfer Learning in a Low-Resource Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voice cloning is a prominent feature in personalized speech interfaces. A neural vocal cloning system can mimic someone's voice using just a few audio samples. Both speaker encoding and speaker adaptation are topics of research in the field of voice cloning. Speaker adaptation relies on fine-tuning a multi-speaker generative model, which involves training a separate model to infer a new speaker embedding used for speaker encoding. Both methods can achieve excellent performance, even with a small number of cloning audios, in terms of the speech's naturalness and similarity to the original speaker. Speaker encoding approaches are more appropriate for low-resource deployment since they require significantly less memory and have a faster cloning time than speaker adaption, which can offer slightly greater naturalness and similarity. The main goal is to create a vocal cloning system that produces audio output with a Nepali accent or that sounds like Nepali. For the further advancement of TTS, the idea of transfer learning was effectively used to address several issues that were encountered in the development of this system, including the poor audio quality and the lack of available data.</description>

Abstract: Neural language representation models such as GPT, pre-trained on large-scale corpora, can effectively capture rich semantic patterns from plain text and be fine-tuned to consistently improve natural language generation performance. However, existing pre-trained language models used to generate lyrics rarely consider rhyme information, which is crucial in lyrics. Using a pre-trained model directly results in poor performance. To enhance the rhyming quality of generated lyrics, we incorporate integrated rhyme information into our model, thereby improving lyric generation performance.</description>

      <title>Customizing Language Models with Instance-wise LoRA for Sequential Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation systems predict a user's next item of interest by analyzing past interactions, aligning recommendations with individual preferences. Leveraging the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge comprehension and reasoning, recent approaches have applied LLMs to sequential recommendation through language generation paradigms. These methods convert user behavior sequences into prompts for LLM fine-tuning, utilizing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules to refine recommendations. However, the uniform application of LoRA across diverse user behaviors sometimes fails to capture individual variability, leading to suboptimal performance and negative transfer between disparate sequences. To address these challenges, we propose Instance-wise LoRA (iLoRA), integrating LoRA with the Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. iLoRA creates a diverse array of experts, each capturing specific aspects of user preferences, and introduces a sequence representation guided gate function. This gate function processes historical interaction sequences to generate enriched representations, guiding the gating network to output customized expert participation weights. This tailored approach mitigates negative transfer and dynamically adjusts to diverse behavior patterns. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of iLoRA, highlighting its superior performance compared to existing methods in capturing user-specific preferences and improving recommendation accuracy.</description>

      <title>SMILE: Zero-Shot Sparse Mixture of Low-Rank Experts Construction From Pre-Trained Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep model training on extensive datasets is increasingly becoming cost-prohibitive, prompting the widespread adoption of deep model fusion techniques to leverage knowledge from pre-existing models. From simple weight averaging to more sophisticated methods like AdaMerging, model fusion effectively improves model performance and accelerates the development of new models. However, potential interference between parameters of individual models and the lack of interpretability in the fusion progress remain significant challenges. Existing methods often try to resolve the parameter interference issue by evaluating attributes of parameters, such as their magnitude or sign, or by parameter pruning. In this study, we begin by examining the fine-tuning of linear layers through the lens of subspace analysis and explicitly define parameter interference as an optimization problem to shed light on this subject. Subsequently, we introduce an innovative approach to model fusion called zero-shot Sparse MIxture of Low-rank Experts (SMILE) construction, which allows for the upscaling of source models into an MoE model without extra data or further training. Our approach relies on the observation that fine-tuning mostly keeps the important parts from the pre-training, but it uses less significant or unused areas to adapt to new tasks. Also, the issue of parameter interference, which is intrinsically intractable in the original parameter space, can be managed by expanding the dimensions. We conduct extensive experiments across diverse scenarios, such as image classification and text generalization tasks, using full fine-tuning and LoRA fine-tuning, and we apply our method to large language models (CLIP models, Flan-T5 models, and Mistral-7B models), highlighting the adaptability and scalability of SMILE.

      <description>arXiv:2408.10175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the effects of occlusions on the fairness of face recognition systems, particularly focusing on demographic biases. Using the Racial Faces in the Wild (RFW) dataset and synthetically added realistic occlusions, we evaluate their effect on the performance of face recognition models trained on the BUPT-Balanced and BUPT-GlobalFace datasets. We note increases in the dispersion of FMR, FNMR, and accuracy alongside decreases in fairness according to Equilized Odds, Demographic Parity, STD of Accuracy, and Fairness Discrepancy Rate. Additionally, we utilize a pixel attribution method to understand the importance of occlusions in model predictions, proposing a new metric, Face Occlusion Impact Ratio (FOIR), that quantifies the extent to which occlusions affect model performance across different demographic groups. Our results indicate that occlusions exacerbate existing demographic biases, with models placing higher importance on occlusions in an unequal fashion, particularly affecting African individuals more severely.</description>

      <title>NeuRodin: A Two-stage Framework for High-Fidelity Neural Surface Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signed Distance Function (SDF)-based volume rendering has demonstrated significant capabilities in surface reconstruction. Although promising, SDF-based methods often fail to capture detailed geometric structures, resulting in visible defects. By comparing SDF-based volume rendering to density-based volume rendering, we identify two main factors within the SDF-based approach that degrade surface quality: SDF-to-density representation and geometric regularization. These factors introduce challenges that hinder the optimization of the SDF field. To address these issues, we introduce NeuRodin, a novel two-stage neural surface reconstruction framework that not only achieves high-fidelity surface reconstruction but also retains the flexible optimization characteristics of density-based methods. NeuRodin incorporates innovative strategies that facilitate transformation of arbitrary topologies and reduce artifacts associated with density bias. Extensive evaluations on the Tanks and Temples and ScanNet++ datasets demonstrate the superiority of NeuRodin, showing strong reconstruction capabilities for both indoor and outdoor environments using solely posed RGB captures.

      <title>Imbalance-Aware Culvert-Sewer Defect Segmentation Using an Enhanced Feature Pyramid Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imbalanced datasets are a significant challenge in real-world scenarios. They lead to models that underperform on underrepresented classes, which is a critical issue in infrastructure inspection. This paper introduces the Enhanced Feature Pyramid Network (E-FPN), a deep learning model for the semantic segmentation of culverts and sewer pipes within imbalanced datasets. The E-FPN incorporates architectural innovations like sparsely connected blocks and depth-wise separable convolutions to improve feature extraction and handle object variations. To address dataset imbalance, the model employs strategies like class decomposition and data augmentation. Experimental results on the culvert-sewer defects dataset and a benchmark aerial semantic segmentation drone dataset show that the E-FPN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Intersection over Union (IoU) improvement of 13.8% and 27.2%, respectively. Additionally, class decomposition and data augmentation together boost the model's performance by approximately 6.9% IoU. The proposed E-FPN presents a promising solution for enhancing object segmentation in challenging, multi-class real-world datasets, with potential applications extending beyond culvert-sewer defect detection.</description>

      <title>Transformers to SSMs: Distilling Quadratic Knowledge to Subquadratic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer architectures have become a dominant paradigm for domains like language modeling but suffer in many inference settings due to their quadratic-time self-attention. Recently proposed subquadratic architectures, such as Mamba, have shown promise, but have been pretrained with substantially less computational resources than the strongest Transformer models. In this work, we present a method that is able to distill a pretrained Transformer architecture into alternative architectures such as state space models (SSMs). The key idea to our approach is that we can view both Transformers and SSMs as applying different forms of mixing matrices over the token sequences. We can thus progressively distill the Transformer architecture by matching different degrees of granularity in the SSM: first matching the mixing matrices themselves, then the hidden units at each block, and finally the end-to-end predictions. Our method, called MOHAWK, is able to distill a Mamba-2 variant based on the Phi-1.5 architecture (Phi-Mamba) using only 3B tokens and a hybrid version (Hybrid Phi-Mamba) using 5B tokens. Despite using less than 1% of the training data typically used to train models from scratch, Phi-Mamba boasts substantially stronger performance compared to all past open-source non-Transformer models. MOHAWK allows models like SSMs to leverage computational resources invested in training Transformer-based architectures, highlighting a new avenue for building such models.</description>

      <title>SpaRP: Fast 3D Object Reconstruction and Pose Estimation from Sparse Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-world 3D generation has recently attracted considerable attention. While many single-image-to-3D methods have yielded visually appealing outcomes, they often lack sufficient controllability and tend to produce hallucinated regions that may not align with users' expectations. In this paper, we explore an important scenario in which the input consists of one or a few unposed 2D images of a single object, with little or no overlap. We propose a novel method, SpaRP, to reconstruct a 3D textured mesh and estimate the relative camera poses for these sparse-view images. SpaRP distills knowledge from 2D diffusion models and finetunes them to implicitly deduce the 3D spatial relationships between the sparse views. The diffusion model is trained to jointly predict surrogate representations for camera poses and multi-view images of the object under known poses, integrating all information from the input sparse views. These predictions are then leveraged to accomplish 3D reconstruction and pose estimation, and the reconstructed 3D model can be used to further refine the camera poses of input views. Through extensive experiments on three datasets, we demonstrate that our method not only significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of 3D reconstruction quality and pose prediction accuracy but also exhibits strong efficiency. It requires only about 20 seconds to produce a textured mesh and camera poses for the input views. Project page: https://chaoxu.xyz/sparp.</description>

      <title>Demystifying the Communication Characteristics for Distributed Transformer Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) models based on the transformer architecture have revolutionized many DL applications such as large language models (LLMs), vision transformers, audio generation, and time series prediction. Much of this progress has been fueled by distributed training, yet distributed communication remains a substantial bottleneck to training progress. This paper examines the communication behavior of transformer models - that is, how different parallelism schemes used in multi-node/multi-GPU DL Training communicate data in the context of transformers. We use GPT-based language models as a case study of the transformer architecture due to their ubiquity. We validate the empirical results obtained from our communication logs using analytical models. At a high level, our analysis reveals a need to optimize small message point-to-point communication further, correlations between sequence length, per-GPU throughput, model size, and optimizations used, and where to potentially guide further optimizations in framework and HPC middleware design and optimization.</description>

      <title>KAN 2.0: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks Meet Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major challenge of AI + Science lies in their inherent incompatibility: today's AI is primarily based on connectionism, while science depends on symbolism. To bridge the two worlds, we propose a framework to seamlessly synergize Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and science. The framework highlights KANs' usage for three aspects of scientific discovery: identifying relevant features, revealing modular structures, and discovering symbolic formulas. The synergy is bidirectional: science to KAN (incorporating scientific knowledge into KANs), and KAN to science (extracting scientific insights from KANs). We highlight major new functionalities in the pykan package: (1) MultKAN: KANs with multiplication nodes. (2) kanpiler: a KAN compiler that compiles symbolic formulas into KANs. (3) tree converter: convert KANs (or any neural networks) to tree graphs. Based on these tools, we demonstrate KANs' capability to discover various types of physical laws, including conserved quantities, Lagrangians, symmetries, and constitutive laws.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the cognitive science theory, we explicitly model an agent with both semantic and episodic memory systems, and show that it is better than having just one of the two memory systems. In order to show this, we have designed and released our own challenging environment, "the Room", compatible with OpenAI Gym, where an agent has to properly learn how to encode, store, and retrieve memories to maximize its rewards. The Room environment allows for a hybrid intelligence setup where machines and humans can collaborate. We show that two agents collaborating with each other results in better performance than one agent acting alone.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the cognitive science theory of the explicit human memory systems, we have modeled an agent with short-term, episodic, and semantic memory systems, each of which is modeled with a knowledge graph. To evaluate this system and analyze the behavior of this agent, we designed and released our own reinforcement learning agent environment, "the Room", where an agent has to learn how to encode, store, and retrieve memories to maximize its return by answering questions. We show that our deep Q-learning based agent successfully learns whether a short-term memory should be forgotten, or rather be stored in the episodic or semantic memory systems. Our experiments indicate that an agent with human-like memory systems can outperform an agent without this memory structure in the environment.</description>

      <title>Could a Large Language Model be Conscious?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has recently been widespread discussion of whether large language models might be sentient. Should we take this idea seriously? I will break down the strongest reasons for and against. Given mainstream assumptions in the science of consciousness, there are significant obstacles to consciousness in current models: for example, their lack of recurrent processing, a global workspace, and unified agency. At the same time, it is quite possible that these obstacles will be overcome in the next decade or so. I conclude that while it is somewhat unlikely that current large language models are conscious, we should take seriously the possibility that successors to large language models may be conscious in the not-too-distant future.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Truth: Emergent Linear Structure in Large Language Model Representations of True/False Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive capabilities, but are prone to outputting falsehoods. Recent work has developed techniques for inferring whether a LLM is telling the truth by training probes on the LLM's internal activations. However, this line of work is controversial, with some authors pointing out failures of these probes to generalize in basic ways, among other conceptual issues. In this work, we use high-quality datasets of simple true/false statements to study in detail the structure of LLM representations of truth, drawing on three lines of evidence: 1. Visualizations of LLM true/false statement representations, which reveal clear linear structure. 2. Transfer experiments in which probes trained on one dataset generalize to different datasets. 3. Causal evidence obtained by surgically intervening in a LLM's forward pass, causing it to treat false statements as true and vice versa. Overall, we present evidence that at sufficient scale, LLMs linearly represent the truth or falsehood of factual statements. We also show that simple difference-in-mean probes generalize as well as other probing techniques while identifying directions which are more causally implicated in model outputs.</description>

      <title>Fast Benchmarking of Asynchronous Multi-Fidelity Optimization on Zero-Cost Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While deep learning has celebrated many successes, its results often hinge on the meticulous selection of hyperparameters (HPs). However, the time-consuming nature of deep learning training makes HP optimization (HPO) a costly endeavor, slowing down the development of efficient HPO tools. While zero-cost benchmarks, which provide performance and runtime without actual training, offer a solution for non-parallel setups, they fall short in parallel setups as each worker must communicate its queried runtime to return its evaluation in the exact order. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a user-friendly Python package that facilitates efficient parallel HPO with zero-cost benchmarks. Our approach calculates the exact return order based on the information stored in file system, eliminating the need for long waiting times and enabling much faster HPO evaluations. We first verify the correctness of our approach through extensive testing and the experiments with 6 popular HPO libraries show its applicability to diverse libraries and its ability to achieve over 1000x speedup compared to a traditional approach. Our package can be installed via pip install mfhpo-simulator.</description>

      <title>An Upload-Efficient Scheme for Transferring Knowledge From a Server-Side Pre-trained Generator to Clients in Heterogeneous Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HtFL) enables task-specific knowledge sharing among clients with different model architectures while preserving privacy. Despite recent research progress, transferring knowledge in HtFL is still difficult due to data and model heterogeneity. To tackle this, we introduce a public pre-trained generator (e.g., StyleGAN or Stable Diffusion) as the bridge and propose a new upload-efficient knowledge transfer scheme called Federated Knowledge-Transfer-Loop (FedKTL). It can produce task-related prototypical image-vector pairs via the generator's inference on the server. With these pairs, each client can transfer common knowledge from the generator to its local model through an additional supervised local task. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets under two types of data heterogeneity with 14 heterogeneous models, including CNNs and ViTs. Results show that our FedKTL surpasses seven state-of-the-art methods by up to 7.31%. Moreover, our knowledge transfer scheme is applicable in cloud-edge scenarios with only one edge client.

      <title>MatchSeg: Towards Better Segmentation via Reference Image Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, automated medical image segmentation methods based on deep learning have achieved great success. However, they heavily rely on large annotated datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to acquire. Few-shot learning aims to overcome the need for annotated data by using a small labeled dataset, known as a support set, to guide predicting labels for new, unlabeled images, known as the query set. Inspired by this paradigm, we introduce MatchSeg, a novel framework that enhances medical image segmentation through strategic reference image matching. We leverage contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) to select highly relevant samples when defining the support set. Additionally, we design a joint attention module to strengthen the interaction between support and query features, facilitating a more effective knowledge transfer between support and query sets. We validated our method across four public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior segmentation performance and powerful domain generalization ability of MatchSeg against existing methods for domain-specific and cross-domain segmentation tasks.

      <title>Data-driven Energy Consumption Modelling for Electric Micromobility using an Open Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The escalating challenges of traffic congestion and environmental degradation underscore the critical importance of embracing E-Mobility solutions in urban spaces. In particular, micro E-Mobility tools such as E-scooters and E-bikes, play a pivotal role in this transition, offering sustainable alternatives for urban commuters. However, the energy consumption patterns for these tools are a critical aspect that impacts their effectiveness in real-world scenarios and is essential for trip planning and boosting user confidence in using these. To this effect, recent studies have utilised physical models customised for specific mobility tools and conditions, but these models struggle with generalization and effectiveness in real-world scenarios due to a notable absence of open datasets for thorough model evaluation and verification. To fill this gap, our work presents an open dataset, collected in Dublin, Ireland, specifically designed for energy modelling research related to E-Scooters and E-Bikes. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption modelling based on the dataset using a set of representative machine learning algorithms and compare their performance against the contemporary mathematical models as a baseline. Our results demonstrate a notable advantage for data-driven models in comparison to the corresponding mathematical models for estimating energy consumption. Specifically, data-driven models outperform physical models in accuracy by up to 83.83% for E-Bikes and 82.16% for E-Scooters based on an in-depth analysis of the dataset under certain assumptions.</description>

      <title>IsoBench: Benchmarking Multimodal Foundation Models on Isomorphic Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current foundation models exhibit impressive capabilities when prompted either with text only or with both image and text inputs. But do their capabilities change depending on the input modality? In this work, we propose $\textbf{IsoBench}$, a benchmark dataset containing problems from four major areas: math, science, algorithms, and games. Each example is presented with multiple $\textbf{isomorphic representations}$ of inputs, such as visual, textual, and mathematical presentations. IsoBench provides fine-grained feedback to diagnose performance gaps caused by the form of the representation. Across various foundation models, we observe that on the same problem, models have a consistent preference towards textual representations. Most prominently, when evaluated on all IsoBench problems, Claude-3 Opus performs 28.7 points worse when provided with images instead of text; similarly, GPT-4 Turbo is 18.7 points worse and Gemini Pro is 14.9 points worse. Finally, we present two prompting techniques, $\textit{IsoCombination}$ and $\textit{IsoScratchPad}$, which improve model performance by considering combinations of, and translations between, different input representations.</description>

      <title>iMTSP: Solving Min-Max Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem with Imperative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00285v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a Min-Max Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP), where the goal is to find a set of tours, one for each agent, to collectively visit all the cities while minimizing the length of the longest tour. Though MTSP has been widely studied, obtaining near-optimal solutions for large-scale problems is still challenging due to its NP-hardness. Recent efforts in data-driven methods face challenges of the need for hard-to-obtain supervision and issues with high variance in gradient estimations, leading to slow convergence and highly suboptimal solutions. We address these issues by reformulating MTSP as a bilevel optimization problem, using the concept of imperative learning (IL). This involves introducing an allocation network that decomposes the MTSP into multiple single-agent traveling salesman problems (TSPs). The longest tour from these TSP solutions is then used to self-supervise the allocation network, resulting in a new self-supervised, bilevel, end-to-end learning framework, which we refer to as imperative MTSP (iMTSP). Additionally, to tackle the high-variance gradient issues during the optimization, we introduce a control variate-based gradient estimation algorithm. Our experiments showed that these innovative designs enable our gradient estimator to converge 20% faster than the advanced reinforcement learning baseline and find up to 80% shorter tour length compared with Google OR-Tools MTSP solver, especially in large-scale problems (e.g. 1000 cities and 15 agents).</description>

Abstract: Deep learning models are often unaware of the inherent constraints of the task they are applied to. However, many downstream tasks require logical consistency. For ontology classification tasks, such constraints include subsumption and disjointness relations between classes.
  In order to increase the consistency of deep learning models, we propose a fuzzy loss that combines label-based loss with terms penalising subsumption- or disjointness-violations. Our evaluation on the ChEBI ontology shows that the fuzzy loss is able to decrease the number of consistency violations by several orders of magnitude without decreasing the classification performance. In addition, we use the fuzzy loss for unsupervised learning. We show that this can further improve consistency on data from a</description>

      <title>Generative AI Voting: Fair Collective Choice is Resilient to LLM Biases and Inconsistencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling up deliberative and voting participation is a longstanding endeavor -- a cornerstone for direct democracy and legitimate collective choice. Recent breakthroughs in generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) unravel new capabilities for AI personal assistants to overcome cognitive bandwidth limitations of humans, providing decision support or even direct representation of human voters at large scale. However, the quality of this representation and what underlying biases manifest when delegating collective decision-making to LLMs is an alarming and timely challenge to tackle. By rigorously emulating with high realism more than &gt;50K LLM voting personas in 81 real-world voting elections, we disentangle the nature of different biases in LLMS (GPT 3, GPT 3.5, and Llama2). Complex preferential ballot formats exhibit significant inconsistencies compared to simpler majoritarian elections that show higher consistency. Strikingly though, by demonstrating for the first time in real-world a proportional representation of voters in direct democracy, we are also able to show that fair ballot aggregation methods, such as equal shares, prove to be a win-win: fairer voting outcomes for humans with fairer AI representation. This novel underlying relationship proves paramount for democratic resilience in progressives scenarios with low voters turnout and voter fatigue supported by AI representatives: abstained voters are mitigated by recovering highly representative voting outcomes that are fairer. These interdisciplinary insights provide remarkable foundations for science, policymakers, and citizens to develop safeguards and resilience for AI risks in democratic innovations.</description>

      <title>Universal Approximation Theory: The Basic Theory for Transformer-based Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language models have emerged as a critical area of focus in artificial intelligence, particularly with the introduction of groundbreaking innovations like ChatGPT. Large-scale Transformer networks have quickly become the leading approach for advancing natural language processing algorithms. Built on the Transformer architecture, these models enable interactions that closely mimic human communication and, equipped with extensive knowledge, can even assist in guiding human tasks. Despite their impressive capabilities and growing complexity, a key question remains-the theoretical foundations of large language models (LLMs). What makes Transformer so effective for powering intelligent language applications, such as translation and coding? What underlies LLMs' ability for In-Context Learning (ICL)? How does the LoRA scheme enhance the fine-tuning of LLMs? And what supports the practicality of pruning LLMs? To address these critical questions and explore the technological strategies within LLMs, we leverage the Universal Approximation Theory (UAT) to offer a theoretical backdrop, shedding light on the mechanisms that underpin these advancements.</description>

      <title>Change-Point Detection in Industrial Data Streams based on Online Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel change-point detection method based on online Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (ODMDwC). Leveraging ODMDwC's ability to find and track linear approximation of a non-linear system while incorporating control effects, the proposed method dynamically adapts to its changing behavior due to aging and seasonality. This approach enables the detection of changes in spatial, temporal, and spectral patterns, providing a robust solution that preserves correspondence between the score and the extent of change in the system dynamics. We formulate a truncated version of ODMDwC and utilize higher-order time-delay embeddings to mitigate noise and extract broad-band features. Our method addresses the challenges faced in industrial settings where safety-critical systems generate non-uniform data streams while requiring timely and accurate change-point detection to protect profit and life. Our results demonstrate that this method yields intuitive and improved detection results compared to the Singular-Value-Decomposition-based method. We validate our approach using synthetic and real-world data, showing its competitiveness to other approaches on complex systems' benchmark datasets. Provided guidelines for hyperparameters selection enhance our method's practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Show, Don't Tell: Evaluating Large Language Models Beyond Textual Understanding with ChildPlay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the hypothesis that LLMs, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, possess broader cognitive functions, particularly in non-linguistic domains. Our approach extends beyond standard linguistic benchmarks by incorporating games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Battleship, encoded via ASCII, to assess strategic thinking and decision-making. To evaluate the models' ability to generalize beyond their training data, we introduce two additional games. The first game, LEGO Connect Language (LCL), tests the models' capacity to understand spatial logic and follow assembly instructions. The second game, the game of shapes, challenges the models to identify shapes represented by 1s within a matrix of zeros, further testing their spatial reasoning skills. This "show, don't tell" strategy uses games instead of simply querying the models. Our results show that despite their proficiency on standard benchmarks, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4's abilities to play and reason about fully observable games without pre-training is mediocre. Both models fail to anticipate losing moves in Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect Four, and they are unable to play Battleship correctly. While GPT-4 shows some success in the game of shapes, both models fail at the assembly tasks presented in the LCL game. These results suggest that while GPT models can emulate conversational proficiency and basic rule comprehension, their performance in strategic gameplay and spatial reasoning tasks is very limited. Importantly, this reveals a blind spot in current LLM benchmarks that we highlight with our gameplay benchmark suite ChildPlay (https://github.com/child-play-neurips/child-play). Our findings provide a cautionary tale about claims of emergent intelligence and reasoning capabilities of LLMs that are roughly the size of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.</description>

      <title>Imitation Learning for Intra-Day Power Grid Operation through Topology Actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power grid operation is becoming increasingly complex due to the increase in generation of renewable energy. The recent series of Learning To Run a Power Network (L2RPN) competitions have encouraged the use of artificial agents to assist human dispatchers in operating power grids. In this paper we study the performance of imitation learning for day-ahead power grid operation through topology actions. In particular, we consider two rule-based expert agents: a greedy agent and a N-1 agent. While the latter is more computationally expensive since it takes N-1 safety considerations into account, it exhibits a much higher operational performance. We train a fully-connected neural network (FCNN) on expert state-action pairs and evaluate it in two ways. First, we find that classification accuracy is limited despite extensive hyperparameter tuning, due to class imbalance and class overlap. Second, as a power system agent, the FCNN performs only slightly worse than expert agents. Furthermore, hybrid agents, which incorporate minimal additional simulations, match expert agents' performance with significantly lower computational cost. Consequently, imitation learning shows promise for developing fast, high-performing power grid agents, motivating its further exploration in future L2RPN studies.</description>

      <title>Simply Trainable Nearest Neighbour Machine Translation with GPU Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nearest neighbor machine translation is a successful approach for fast domain adaption, which interpolates the pre-trained transformers with domain-specific token-level k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) retrieval without retraining. Despite kNN MT's success, searching large reference corpus and fixed interpolation between the kNN and pre-trained model led to computational complexity and translation quality challenges. Among other papers, Dai et al. proposed methods to obtain a small number of reference samples dynamically for which they introduced a distance-aware interpolation method using an equation that includes free parameters. This paper proposes a simply trainable nearest neighbor machine translation and carry out inference experiments on GPU. Similar to Dai et al., we first adaptively construct a small datastore for each input sentence. Second, we train a single-layer network for the interpolation coefficient between the knnMT and pre-trained result to automatically interpolate in different domains. Experimental results on different domains show that our proposed method either improves or sometimes maintain the translation quality of methods in Dai et al. while being automatic. In addition, our GPU inference results demonstrate that knnMT can be integrated into GPUs with a drop of only 5% in terms of speed.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Global Perturbation Robustness of Image Models using Axiomatic Spectral Importance Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perturbation robustness evaluates the vulnerabilities of models, arising from a variety of perturbations, such as data corruptions and adversarial attacks. Understanding the mechanisms of perturbation robustness is critical for global interpretability. We present a model-agnostic, global mechanistic interpretability method to interpret the perturbation robustness of image models. This research is motivated by two key aspects. First, previous global interpretability works, in tandem with robustness benchmarks, e.g. mean corruption error (mCE), are not designed to directly interpret the mechanisms of perturbation robustness within image models. Second, we notice that the spectral signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of perturbed natural images exponentially decay over the frequency. This power-law-like decay implies that: Low-frequency signals are generally more robust than high-frequency signals -- yet high classification accuracy can not be achieved by low-frequency signals alone. By applying Shapley value theory, our method axiomatically quantifies the predictive powers of robust features and non-robust features within an information theory framework. Our method, dubbed as \textbf{I-ASIDE} (\textbf{I}mage \textbf{A}xiomatic \textbf{S}pectral \textbf{I}mportance \textbf{D}ecomposition \textbf{E}xplanation), provides a unique insight into model robustness mechanisms. We conduct extensive experiments over a variety of vision models pre-trained on ImageNet to show that \textbf{I-ASIDE} can not only \textbf{measure} the perturbation robustness but also \textbf{provide interpretations} of its mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: Humans observe only part of their environment at any moment but can still make complex, long-term decisions thanks to our long-term memory. To test how an AI can learn and utilize its long-term memory, we have developed a partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) environment, where the agent has to answer questions while navigating a maze. The environment is completely knowledge graph (KG) based, where the hidden states are dynamic KGs. A KG is both human- and machine-readable, making it easy to see what the agents remember and forget. We train and compare agents with different memory systems, to shed light on how human brains work when it comes to managing its own memory. By repurposing the given learning objective as learning a memory management policy, we were able to capture the most likely hidden state, which is not only interpretable but also reusable.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents the contribution of the Data Science Kitchen at GermEval 2021 shared task on the identification of toxic, engaging, and fact-claiming comments. The task aims at extending the identification of offensive language, by including additional subtasks that identify comments which should be prioritized for fact-checking by moderators and community managers. Our contribution focuses on a feature-engineering approach with a conventional classification backend. We combine semantic and writing style embeddings derived from pre-trained deep neural networks with additional numerical features, specifically designed for this task. Classifier ensembles are used to derive predictions for each subtask via a majority voting scheme. Our best submission achieved macro-averaged F1-scores of 66.8\%,\,69.9\% and 72.5\% for the identification of toxic, engaging, and fact-claiming comments.</description>

      <title>Fight Perturbations with Perturbations: Defending Adversarial Attacks via Neuron Influence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.13060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vulnerabilities of deep learning models towards adversarial attacks have attracted increasing attention, especially when models are deployed in security-critical domains. Numerous defense methods, including reactive and proactive ones, have been proposed for model robustness improvement. Reactive defenses, such as conducting transformations to remove perturbations, usually fail to handle large perturbations. The proactive defenses that involve retraining, suffer from the attack dependency and high computation cost. In this paper, we consider defense methods from the general effect of adversarial attacks that take on neurons inside the model. We introduce the concept of neuron influence, which can quantitatively measure neurons' contribution to correct classification. Then, we observe that almost all attacks fool the model by suppressing neurons with larger influence and enhancing those with smaller influence. Based on this, we propose \emph{Neuron-level Inverse Perturbation} (NIP), a novel defense against general adversarial attacks. It calculates neuron influence from benign examples and then modifies input examples by generating inverse perturbations that can in turn strengthen neurons with larger influence and weaken those with smaller influence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.07410v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamental property commonly used in various quantum information protocols and algorithms. Nonetheless, the problem of identifying entanglement has still not reached a general solution for systems larger than $2\times3$. In this study, we use deep convolutional NNs, a type of supervised machine learning, to identify quantum entanglement for any bipartition in a 3-qubit system. We demonstrate that training the model on synthetically generated datasets of random density matrices excluding challenging positive-under-partial-transposition entangled states (PPTES), which cannot be identified (and correctly labeled) in general, leads to good model accuracy even for PPTES states, that were outside the training data. Our aim is to enhance the model's generalization on PPTES. By applying entanglement-preserving symmetry operations through a triple Siamese network trained in a semi-supervised manner, we improve the model's accuracy and ability to recognize PPTES. Moreover, by constructing an ensemble of Siamese models, even better generalization is observed, in analogy with the idea of finding separate types of entanglement witnesses for different classes of states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AI algorithms increasingly participate in daily activities, it becomes critical to ascertain whether the agents we interact with are human or not. To address this question, we turn to the Turing test and systematically benchmark current AIs in their abilities to imitate humans in three language tasks (Image captioning, Word association, and Conversation) and three vision tasks (Object detection, Color estimation, and Attention prediction). The experiments involved 549 human agents plus 26 AI agents for dataset creation, and 1,126 human judges plus 10 AI judges, in 25,650 Turing-like tests. The results reveal that current AIs are not far from being able to impersonate humans in complex language and vision challenges. While human judges were often deceived, simple AI judges outperformed human judges in distinguishing human answers from AI answers. The results of imitation tests are only minimally correlated with standard performance metrics in AI. Thus, evaluating whether a machine can pass as a human constitutes an important independent test to evaluate AI algorithms. The curated, large-scale, Turing datasets introduced here and their evaluation metrics provide new benchmarks and insights to assess whether an agent is human or not and emphasize the relevance of rigorous, systematic, and quantitative imitation tests in these and other AI domains.</description>

      <title>Patch of Invisibility: Naturalistic Physical Black-Box Adversarial Attacks on Object Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04238v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks on deep-learning models have been receiving increased attention in recent years. Work in this area has mostly focused on gradient-based techniques, so-called "white-box" attacks, wherein the attacker has access to the targeted model's internal parameters; such an assumption is usually unrealistic in the real world. Some attacks additionally use the entire pixel space to fool a given model, which is neither practical nor physical (i.e., real-world). On the contrary, we propose herein a direct, black-box, gradient-free method that uses the learned image manifold of a pretrained generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate naturalistic physical adversarial patches for object detectors. To our knowledge this is the first and only method that performs black-box physical attacks directly on object-detection models, which results with a model-agnostic attack. We show that our proposed method works both digitally and physically. We compared our approach against four different black-box attacks with different configurations. Our approach outperformed all other approaches that were tested in our experiments by a large margin.</description>

Recent studies demonstrate that such designs can be effectively automated and accelerated via tools from machine learning (ML), thus enabling ML-driven classes of error-correction codes with promising performance gains compared to classical designs. A fundamental challenge, however, is that it is prohibitively complex, if not impossible, to design and train fully ML-driven encoder and decoder pairs for large code dimensions. In this paper, we propose Product Autoencoder (ProductAE) -- a computationally-efficient family of deep learning driven (encoder, decoder) pairs -- aimed at enabling the training of relatively large codes (both encoder and decoder) with a manageable training complexity. We build upon ideas from classical product codes and propose constructing large neural codes using smaller code components. ProductAE boils down the complex problem of training the encoder and decoder for a large code dimension $k$ and blocklength $n$ to less-complex sub-problems of training encoders and decoders for smaller dimensions and blocklengths. Our training results show successful training of ProductAEs of dimensions as large as $k = 300$ bits with meaningful performance gains compared to state-of-the-art classical and neural designs. Moreover, we demonstrate excellent robustness and adaptivity of ProductAEs to channel models different than the ones used for training.</description>

      <title>Loss- and Reward-Weighting for Efficient Distributed Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces two learning schemes for distributed agents in Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments, namely Reward-Weighted (R-Weighted) and Loss-Weighted (L-Weighted) gradient merger. The R/L weighted methods replace standard practices for training multiple agents, such as summing or averaging the gradients. The core of our methods is to scale the gradient of each actor based on how high the reward (for R-Weighted) or the loss (for L-Weighted) is compared to the other actors. During training, each agent operates in differently initialized versions of the same environment, which gives different gradients from different actors. In essence, the R-Weights and L-Weights of each agent inform the other agents of its potential, which again reports which environment should be prioritized for learning. This approach of distributed learning is possible because environments that yield higher rewards, or low losses, have more critical information than environments that yield lower rewards or higher losses. We empirically demonstrate that the R-Weighted methods work superior to the state-of-the-art in multiple RL environments.</description>

      <title>LLMs for Knowledge Graph Construction and Reasoning: Recent Capabilities and Future Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13168v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an exhaustive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Knowledge Graph (KG) construction and reasoning. We engage in experiments across eight diverse datasets, focusing on four representative tasks encompassing entity and relation extraction, event extraction, link prediction, and question-answering, thereby thoroughly exploring LLMs' performance in the domain of construction and inference. Empirically, our findings suggest that LLMs, represented by GPT-4, are more suited as inference assistants rather than few-shot information extractors. Specifically, while GPT-4 exhibits good performance in tasks related to KG construction, it excels further in reasoning tasks, surpassing fine-tuned models in certain cases. Moreover, our investigation extends to the potential generalization ability of LLMs for information extraction, leading to the proposition of a Virtual Knowledge Extraction task and the development of the corresponding VINE dataset. Based on these empirical findings, we further propose AutoKG, a multi-agent-based approach employing LLMs and external sources for KG construction and reasoning. We anticipate that this research can provide invaluable insights for future undertakings in the field of knowledge graphs. The code and datasets are in https://github.com/zjunlp/AutoKG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning has drawn considerable interest in recent years, given its promise to improve sample efficiency. Moreover, when using deep-learned models, it is potentially possible to learn compact models from complex sensor data. However, the effectiveness of these learned models, particularly their capacity to plan, i.e., to improve the current policy, remains unclear. In this work, we study MuZero, a well-known deep model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, and explore how far it achieves its learning objective of a value-equivalent model and how useful the learned models are for policy improvement. Amongst various other insights, we conclude that the model learned by MuZero cannot effectively generalize to evaluate unseen policies, which limits the extent to which we can additionally improve the current policy by planning with the model.</description>

      <title>LoraHub: Efficient Cross-Task Generalization via Dynamic LoRA Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-rank adaptations (LoRA) are often employed to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) for new tasks. This paper investigates LoRA composability for cross-task generalization and introduces LoraHub, a simple framework devised for the purposive assembly of LoRA modules trained on diverse given tasks, with the objective of achieving adaptable performance on unseen tasks. With just a few examples from a new task, LoraHub can fluidly combine multiple LoRA modules, eliminating the need for human expertise and assumptions. Notably, the composition requires neither additional model parameters nor gradients. Empirical results on the Big-Bench Hard benchmark suggest that LoraHub, while not surpassing the performance of in-context learning, offers a notable performance-efficiency trade-off in few-shot scenarios by employing a significantly reduced number of tokens per example during inference. Notably, LoraHub establishes a better upper bound compared to in-context learning when paired with different demonstration examples, demonstrating its potential for future development. Our vision is to establish a platform for LoRA modules, empowering users to share their trained LoRA modules. This collaborative approach facilitates the seamless application of LoRA modules to novel tasks, contributing to an adaptive ecosystem. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/lorahub, and all the pre-trained LoRA modules are released at https://huggingface.co/lorahub.</description>

      <title>RAVEN: In-Context Learning with Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the in-context learning ability of retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder language models. We first conduct a comprehensive analysis of existing models and identify their limitations in in-context learning, primarily due to a mismatch between pretraining and inference, as well as a restricted context length. To address these issues, we propose RAVEN, a model that combines retrieval-augmented masked language modeling and prefix language modeling. We further introduce Fusion-in-Context Learning to enhance the few-shot performance by enabling the model to leverage more in-context examples without requiring additional training. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our simple yet effective design significantly improves performance, achieving results comparable to the most advanced language models in certain scenarios, despite having substantially fewer parameters. Our work underscores the potential of retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder language models for in-context learning and encourages further research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Applications of Nature-Inspired Metaheuristic Algorithms for Tackling Optimization Problems Across Disciplines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10875v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms are important components of artificial intelligence, and are increasingly used across disciplines to tackle various types of challenging optimization problems. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of such algorithms for solving a variety of challenging optimization problems in statistics using a nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm called competitive swarm optimizer with mutated agents (CSO-MA). This algorithm was proposed by one of the authors and its superior performance relative to many of its competitors had been demonstrated in earlier work and again in this paper. The main goal of this paper is to show a typical nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithmi, like CSO-MA, is efficient for tackling many different types of optimization problems in statistics. Our applications are new and include finding maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in a single cell generalized trend model to study pseudotime in bioinformatics, estimating parameters in the commonly used Rasch model in education research, finding M-estimates for a Cox regression in a Markov renewal model, performing matrix completion tasks to impute missing data for a two compartment model, and selecting variables optimally in an ecology problem in China. To further demonstrate the flexibility of metaheuristics, we also find an optimal design for a car refueling experiment in the auto industry using a logistic model with multiple interacting factors. In addition, we show that metaheuristics can sometimes outperform optimization algorithms commonly used in statistics.</description>

      <title>$\rm SP^3$: Enhancing Structured Pruning via PCA Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structured pruning is a widely used technique for reducing the size of pre-trained language models (PLMs), but current methods often overlook the potential of compressing the hidden dimension (d) in PLMs, a dimension critical to model size and efficiency. This paper introduces a novel structured pruning approach, Structured Pruning with PCA Projection (SP3), targeting the effective reduction of d by projecting features into a space defined by principal components before masking. Extensive experiments on benchmarks (GLUE and SQuAD) show that SP3 can reduce d by 70%, compress 94% of the BERTbase model, maintain over 96% accuracy, and outperform other methods that compress d by 6% in accuracy at the same compression ratio. SP3 has also proven effective with other models, including OPT and Llama. Our data and code are available at an anonymous repo.</description>

      <title>Learning Using Generated Privileged Information by Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning Using Privileged Information is a particular type of knowledge distillation where the teacher model benefits from an additional data representation during training, called privileged information, improving the student model, which does not see the extra representation. However, privileged information is rarely available in practice. To this end, we propose a text classification framework that harnesses text-to-image diffusion models to generate artificial privileged information. The generated images and the original text samples are further used to train multimodal teacher models based on state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures. Finally, the knowledge from multimodal teachers is distilled into a text-based (unimodal) student. Hence, by employing a generative model to produce synthetic data as privileged information, we guide the training of the student model. Our framework, called Learning Using Generated Privileged Information (LUGPI), yields noticeable performance gains on four text classification data sets, demonstrating its potential in text classification without any additional cost during inference.</description>

      <title>Beyond One-Preference-Fits-All Alignment: Multi-Objective Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03708v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A single language model, even when aligned with labelers through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), may not suit all human preferences. Recent approaches therefore prefer customization, gathering multi-dimensional feedback, and creating distinct reward models for each dimension. Different language models are then optimized for various preferences using multi-objective RLHF (MORLHF) with varying reward weights. However, RL fine-tuning is unstable and resource-heavy, especially with diverse and usually conflicting objectives. In this paper, we present Multi-Objective Direct Preference Optimization (MODPO), an RL-free extension of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for multiple alignment objectives. Essentially, MODPO folds language modeling directly into reward modeling, training language models as implicit collective reward models that combine all objectives with specific weights. MODPO theoretically yields the same optimal solutions as MORLHF but is practically more stable and efficient. Empirical results in safety alignment and long-form question answering show that MODPO matches or outperforms existing methods, producing a Pareto front of language models catering to diverse preferences with three times less computational resources compared to MORLHF.

      <description>arXiv:2310.08809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving human-like dexterous manipulation remains a crucial area of research in robotics. Current research focuses on improving the success rate of pick-and-place tasks. Compared with pick-and-place, throwing-catching behavior has the potential to increase the speed of transporting objects to their destination. However, dynamic dexterous manipulation poses a major challenge for stable control due to a large number of dynamic contacts. In this paper, we propose a Learning-based framework for Throwing-Catching tasks using dexterous hands (LTC). Our method, LTC, achieves a 73\% success rate across 45 scenarios (diverse hand poses and objects), and the learned policies demonstrate strong zero-shot transfer performance on unseen objects. Additionally, in tasks where the object in hand faces sideways, an extremely unstable scenario due to the lack of support from the palm, all baselines fail, while our method still achieves a success rate of over 60\%.</description>

      <title>Mind the Model, Not the Agent: The Primacy Bias in Model-based RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primacy bias in model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL), which refers to the agent's tendency to overfit early data and lose the ability to learn from new data, can significantly decrease the performance of MFRL algorithms. Previous studies have shown that employing simple techniques, such as resetting the agent's parameters, can substantially alleviate the primacy bias in MFRL. However, the primacy bias in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) remains unexplored. In this work, we focus on investigating the primacy bias in MBRL. We begin by observing that resetting the agent's parameters harms its performance in the context of MBRL. We further find that the primacy bias in MBRL is more closely related to the primacy bias of the world model instead of the primacy bias of the agent. Based on this finding, we propose \textit{world model resetting}, a simple yet effective technique to alleviate the primacy bias in MBRL. We apply our method to two different MBRL algorithms, MBPO and DreamerV2. We validate the effectiveness of our method on multiple continuous control tasks on MuJoCo and DeepMind Control Suite, as well as discrete control tasks on Atari 100k benchmark. The experimental results show that \textit{world model resetting} can significantly alleviate the primacy bias in the model-based setting and improve the algorithm's performance. We also give a guide on how to perform \textit{world model resetting} effectively.</description>

      <title>Towards A Unified View of Answer Calibration for Multi-Step Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09101v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) employing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have broadened the scope for improving multi-step reasoning capabilities. We generally divide multi-step reasoning into two phases: path generation to generate the reasoning path(s); and answer calibration post-processing the reasoning path(s) to obtain a final answer. However, the existing literature lacks systematic analysis on different answer calibration approaches. In this paper, we summarize the taxonomy of recent answer calibration techniques and break them down into step-level and path-level strategies. We then conduct a thorough evaluation on these strategies from a unified view, systematically scrutinizing step-level and path-level answer calibration across multiple paths. Experimental results reveal that integrating the dominance of both strategies tends to derive optimal outcomes. Our study holds the potential to illuminate key insights for optimizing multi-step reasoning with answer calibration.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal learning, pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable capacities in bridging the gap between visual and language modalities. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly in the image modality, presenting considerable security risks. This paper introduces Adversarial Prompt Tuning (AdvPT), a novel technique to enhance the adversarial robustness of image encoders in VLMs. AdvPT innovatively leverages learnable text prompts and aligns them with adversarial image embeddings, to address the vulnerabilities inherent in VLMs without the need for extensive parameter training or modification of the model architecture. We demonstrate that AdvPT improves resistance against white-box and black-box adversarial attacks and exhibits a synergistic effect when combined with existing image-processing-based defense techniques, further boosting defensive capabilities. Comprehensive experimental analyses provide insights into adversarial prompt tuning, a novel paradigm devoted to improving resistance to adversarial images through textual input modifications, paving the way for future robust multimodal learning research. These findings open up new possibilities for enhancing the security of VLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/jiamingzhang94/Adversarial-Prompt-Tuning.</description>

      <title>Two-step dynamic obstacle avoidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic obstacle avoidance (DOA) is a fundamental challenge for any autonomous vehicle, independent of whether it operates in sea, air, or land. This paper proposes a two-step architecture for handling DOA tasks by combining supervised and reinforcement learning (RL). In the first step, we introduce a data-driven approach to estimate the collision risk (CR) of an obstacle using a recurrent neural network, which is trained in a supervised fashion and offers robustness to non-linear obstacle movements. In the second step, we include these CR estimates into the observation space of an RL agent to increase its situational awareness. We illustrate the power of our two-step approach by training different RL agents in a challenging environment that requires to navigate amid multiple obstacles. The non-linear movements of obstacles are exemplarily modeled based on stochastic processes and periodic patterns, although our architecture is suitable for any obstacle dynamics. The experiments reveal that integrating our CR metrics into the observation space doubles the performance in terms of reward, which is equivalent to halving the number of collisions in the considered environment. We also perform a generalization experiment to validate the proposal in an RL environment based on maritime traffic and real-world vessel trajectory data. Furthermore, we show that the architecture's performance improvement is independent of the applied RL algorithm.</description>

      <title>Bergeron: Combating Adversarial Attacks through a Conscience-Based Alignment Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00029v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research into AI alignment has grown considerably since the recent introduction of increasingly capable Large Language Models (LLMs). Unfortunately, modern methods of alignment still fail to fully prevent harmful responses when models are deliberately attacked. Such vulnerabilities can lead to LLMs being manipulated into generating hazardous content: from instructions for creating dangerous materials to inciting violence or endorsing unethical behaviors. To help mitigate this issue, we introduce Bergeron: a framework designed to improve the robustness of LLMs against attacks without any additional parameter fine-tuning. Bergeron is organized into two tiers; with a secondary LLM acting as a guardian to the primary LLM. This framework better safeguards the primary model against incoming attacks while monitoring its output for any harmful content. Empirical analysis reviews that by using Bergeron to complement models with existing alignment training, we can significantly improve the robustness and safety of multiple, commonly used commercial and open-source LLMs. Specifically, we found that models integrated with Bergeron are, on average, nearly seven times more resistant to attacks compared to models without such support.</description>

      <title>k* Distribution: Evaluating the Latent Space of Deep Neural Networks using Local Neighborhood Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most examinations of neural networks' learned latent spaces typically employ dimensionality reduction techniques such as t-SNE or UMAP. These methods distort the local neighborhood in the visualization, making it hard to distinguish the structure of a subset of samples in the latent space. In response to this challenge, we introduce the {k*~distribution} and its corresponding visualization technique This method uses local neighborhood analysis to guarantee the preservation of the structure of sample distributions for individual classes within the subset of the learned latent space. This facilitates easy comparison of different k*~distributions, enabling analysis of how various classes are processed by the same neural network. Our study reveals three distinct distributions of samples within the learned latent space subset: a) Fractured, b) Overlapped, and c) Clustered, providing a more profound understanding of existing contemporary visualizations. Experiments show that the distribution of samples within the network's learned latent space significantly varies depending on the class. Furthermore, we illustrate that our analysis can be applied to explore the latent space of diverse neural network architectures, various layers within neural networks, transformations applied to input samples, and the distribution of training and testing data for neural networks. Thus, the k* distribution should aid in visualizing the structure inside neural networks and further foster their understanding.

      <title>Clue-Guided Path Exploration: Optimizing Knowledge Graph Retrieval with Large Language Models to Address the Information Black Box Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent times, large language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities. However, updating their knowledge poses challenges, potentially leading to inaccuracies when confronted with unfamiliar queries. To address this issue, integrating external knowledge bases such as knowledge graphs with large language models is a viable approach. The key challenge lies in extracting the required knowledge from knowledge graphs based on natural language, demanding high semantic understanding. Therefore, researchers are considering leveraging large language models directly for knowledge retrieval from these graphs. Current efforts typically rely on the comprehensive problem-solving capabilities of large language models. We argue that a problem we term the 'information black box' can significantly impact the practical effectiveness of such methods. Moreover, this kind of methods is less effective for scenarios where the questions are unfamiliar to the large language models. In this paper, we propose a Clue-Guided Path Exploration (CGPE) framework to optimize knowledge retrieval based on large language models. By addressing the 'information black box' issue and employing single-task approaches instead of complex tasks, we have enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of using large language models for retrieving knowledge graphs. Experiments on open-source datasets reveal that CGPE outperforms previous methods and is highly applicable to LLMs with fewer parameters. In some instances, even ChatGLM3, with its 6 billion parameters, can rival the performance of GPT-4. Furthermore, the results indicate a minimal invocation frequency of CGPE on LLMs, suggesting reduced computational overhead. For organizations and individuals facing constraints in computational resources, our research offers significant practical value.</description>

      <title>UniMem: Towards a Unified View of Long-Context Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-context processing is a critical ability that constrains the applicability of large language models (LLMs). Although there exist various methods devoted to enhancing the long-context processing ability of LLMs, they are developed in an isolated manner and lack systematic analysis and integration of their strengths, hindering further developments. In this paper, we introduce UniMem, a Unified framework that reformulates existing long-context methods from the view of Memory augmentation of LLMs. Distinguished by its four core dimensions-Memory Management, Memory Writing, Memory Reading, and Memory Injection, UniMem empowers researchers to conduct systematic exploration of long-context methods. We re-formulate 16 existing methods based on UniMem and analyze four representative methods: Transformer-XL, Memorizing Transformer, RMT, and Longformer into equivalent UniMem forms to reveal their design principles and strengths. Based on these analyses, we propose UniMix, an innovative approach that integrates the strengths of these algorithms. Experimental results show that UniMix achieves superior performance in handling long contexts with significantly lower perplexity than baselines.</description>

      <title>CIC: A framework for Culturally-aware Image Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image Captioning generates descriptive sentences from images using Vision-Language Pre-trained models (VLPs) such as BLIP, which has improved greatly. However, current methods lack the generation of detailed descriptive captions for the cultural elements depicted in the images, such as the traditional clothing worn by people from Asian cultural groups. In this paper, we propose a new framework, Culturally-aware Image Captioning (CIC), that generates captions and describes cultural elements extracted from cultural visual elements in images representing cultures. Inspired by methods combining visual modality and Large Language Models (LLMs) through appropriate prompts, our framework (1) generates questions based on cultural categories from images, (2) extracts cultural visual elements from Visual Question Answering (VQA) using generated questions, and (3) generates culturally-aware captions using LLMs with the prompts. Our human evaluation conducted on 45 participants from 4 different cultural groups with a high understanding of the corresponding culture shows that our proposed framework generates more culturally descriptive captions when compared to the image captioning baseline based on VLPs.

      <title>G-SciEdBERT: A Contextualized LLM for Science Assessment Tasks in German</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advancement of natural language processing has paved the way for automated scoring systems in various languages, such as German (e.g., German BERT [G-BERT]). Automatically scoring written responses to science questions in German is a complex task and challenging for standard G-BERT as they lack contextual knowledge in the science domain and may be unaligned with student writing styles. This paper presents a contextualized German Science Education BERT (G-SciEdBERT), an innovative large language model tailored for scoring German-written responses to science tasks and beyond. Using G-BERT, we pre-trained G-SciEdBERT on a corpus of 30K German written science responses with 3M tokens on the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018. We fine-tuned G-SciEdBERT on an additional 20K student-written responses with 2M tokens and examined the scoring accuracy. We then compared its scoring performance with G-BERT. Our findings revealed a substantial improvement in scoring accuracy with G-SciEdBERT, demonstrating a 10.2% increase of quadratic weighted Kappa compared to G-BERT (mean difference = 0.1026, SD = 0.069). These insights underline the significance of specialized language models like G-SciEdBERT, which is trained to enhance the accuracy of contextualized automated scoring, offering a substantial contribution to the field of AI in education.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Reasoning Based on Large Language Models for Autonomous Car Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13602v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for their ability to understand text and images, generate human-like text, and perform complex reasoning tasks. However, their ability to generalize this advanced reasoning with a combination of natural language text for decision-making in dynamic situations requires further exploration. In this study, we investigate how well LLMs can adapt and apply a combination of arithmetic and common-sense reasoning, particularly in autonomous driving scenarios. We hypothesize that LLMs hybrid reasoning abilities can improve autonomous driving by enabling them to analyze detected object and sensor data, understand driving regulations and physical laws, and offer additional context. This addresses complex scenarios, like decisions in low visibility (due to weather conditions), where traditional methods might fall short. We evaluated Large Language Models (LLMs) based on accuracy by comparing their answers with human-generated ground truth inside CARLA. The results showed that when a combination of images (detected objects) and sensor data is fed into the LLM, it can offer precise information for brake and throttle control in autonomous vehicles across various weather conditions. This formulation and answers can assist in decision-making for auto-pilot systems.</description>

      <title>WeakSAM: Segment Anything Meets Weakly-supervised Instance-level Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weakly supervised visual recognition using inexact supervision is a critical yet challenging learning problem. It significantly reduces human labeling costs and traditionally relies on multi-instance learning and pseudo-labeling. This paper introduces WeakSAM and solves the weakly-supervised object detection (WSOD) and segmentation by utilizing the pre-learned world knowledge contained in a vision foundation model, i.e., the Segment Anything Model (SAM). WeakSAM addresses two critical limitations in traditional WSOD retraining, i.e., pseudo ground truth (PGT) incompleteness and noisy PGT instances, through adaptive PGT generation and Region of Interest (RoI) drop regularization. It also addresses the SAM's problems of requiring prompts and category unawareness for automatic object detection and segmentation. Our results indicate that WeakSAM significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in WSOD and WSIS benchmarks with large margins, i.e. average improvements of 7.4% and 8.5%, respectively. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/hustvl/WeakSAM}.</description>

      <title>Wilcoxon Nonparametric CFAR Scheme for Ship Detection in SAR Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The parametric constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection algorithms which are based on various statistical distributions, such as Gaussian, Gamma, Weibull, log-normal, G0 distribution, alpha-stable distribution, etc, are most widely used to detect the ship targets in SAR image at present. However, the clutter background in SAR images is complicated and variable. When the actual clutter background deviates from the assumed statistical distribution, the performance of the parametric CFAR detector will deteriorate. In addition to the parametric CFAR schemes, there is another class of nonparametric CFAR detectors which can maintain a constant false alarm rate for the target detection without the assumption of a known clutter distribution. In this work, the Wilcoxon nonparametric CFAR scheme for ship detection in SAR image is proposed and analyzed, and a closed form of the false alarm rate for the Wilcoxon nonparametric detector to determine the decision threshold is presented. By comparison with several typical parametric CFAR schemes on Radarsat-2, ICEYE-X6 and Gaofen-3 SAR images, the robustness of the Wilcoxon nonparametric detector to maintain a good false alarm performance in different detection backgrounds is revealed, and its detection performance for the weak ship in rough sea surface is improved to some extent. Moreover, the Wilcoxon nonparametric detector can suppress the false alarms resulting from the sidelobes at some degree and its detection speed is fast.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning has shown great potential for enabling robots to acquire complex manipulation behaviors. However, these algorithms suffer from high sample complexity in long-horizon tasks, where compounding errors accumulate over the task horizons. We present PRIME (PRimitive-based IMitation with data Efficiency), a behavior primitive-based framework designed for improving the data efficiency of imitation learning. PRIME scaffolds robot tasks by decomposing task demonstrations into primitive sequences, followed by learning a high-level control policy to sequence primitives through imitation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that PRIME achieves a significant performance improvement in multi-stage manipulation tasks, with 10-34% higher success rates in simulation over state-of-the-art baselines and 20-48% on physical hardware.</description>

      <title>DyCE: Dynamically Configurable Exiting for Deep Learning Compression and Real-time Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional deep learning (DL) model compression and scaling methods focus on altering the model's components, impacting the results across all samples uniformly. However, since samples vary in difficulty, a dynamic model that adapts computation based on sample complexity offers a novel perspective for compression and scaling. Despite this potential, existing dynamic models are typically monolithic and model-specific, limiting their generalizability as broad compression and scaling methods. Additionally, most deployed DL systems are fixed, unable to adjust their scale once deployed and, therefore, cannot adapt to the varying real-time demands. This paper introduces DyCE, a dynamically configurable system that can adjust the performance-complexity trade-off of a DL model at runtime without requiring re-initialization or redeployment on inference hardware. DyCE achieves this by adding small exit networks to intermediate layers of the original model, allowing computation to terminate early if acceptable results are obtained. DyCE also decouples the design of an efficient dynamic model, facilitating easy adaptation to new base models and potential general use in compression and scaling. We also propose methods for generating optimized configurations and determining the types and positions of exit networks to achieve desired performance and complexity trade-offs. By enabling simple configuration switching, DyCE provides fine-grained performance tuning in real-time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DyCE through image classification tasks using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). DyCE significantly reduces computational complexity by 23.5% for ResNet152 and 25.9% for ConvNextv2-tiny on ImageNet, with accuracy reductions of less than 0.5%.</description>

      <title>Symbiotic Game and Foundation Models for Cyber Deception Operations in Strategic Cyber Warfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are currently facing unprecedented cyber warfare with the rapid evolution of tactics, increasing asymmetry of intelligence, and the growing accessibility of hacking tools. In this landscape, cyber deception emerges as a critical component of our defense strategy against increasingly sophisticated attacks. This chapter aims to highlight the pivotal role of game-theoretic models and foundation models (FMs) in analyzing, designing, and implementing cyber deception tactics. Game models (GMs) serve as a foundational framework for modeling diverse adversarial interactions, allowing us to encapsulate both adversarial knowledge and domain-specific insights. Meanwhile, FMs serve as the building blocks for creating tailored machine learning models suited to given applications. By leveraging the synergy between GMs and FMs, we can advance proactive and automated cyber defense mechanisms by not only securing our networks against attacks but also enhancing their resilience against well-planned operations. This chapter discusses the games at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels of warfare, delves into the symbiotic relationship between these methodologies, and explores relevant applications where such a framework can make a substantial impact in cybersecurity. The chapter discusses the promising direction of the multi-agent neurosymbolic conjectural learning (MANSCOL), which allows the defender to predict adversarial behaviors, design adaptive defensive deception tactics, and synthesize knowledge for the operational level synthesis and adaptation. FMs serve as pivotal tools across various functions for MANSCOL, including reinforcement learning, knowledge assimilation, formation of conjectures, and contextual representation. This chapter concludes with a discussion of the challenges associated with FMs and their application in the domain of cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>MathVerse: Does Your Multi-modal LLM Truly See the Diagrams in Visual Math Problems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable progress of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has garnered unparalleled attention, due to their superior performance in visual contexts. However, their capabilities in visual math problem-solving remain insufficiently evaluated and understood. We investigate current benchmarks to incorporate excessive visual content within textual questions, which potentially assist MLLMs in deducing answers without truly interpreting the input diagrams. To this end, we introduce MathVerse, an all-around visual math benchmark designed for an equitable and in-depth evaluation of MLLMs. We meticulously collect 2,612 high-quality, multi-subject math problems with diagrams from publicly available sources. Each problem is then transformed by human annotators into six distinct versions, each offering varying degrees of information content in multi-modality, contributing to 15K test samples in total. This approach allows MathVerse to comprehensively assess whether and how much MLLMs can truly understand the visual diagrams for mathematical reasoning. In addition, we propose a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation strategy for a fine-grained assessment of the output answers. Rather than naively judging True or False, we employ GPT-4(V) to adaptively extract crucial reasoning steps, and then score each step with detailed error analysis, which can reveal the intermediate CoT reasoning quality by MLLMs. We hope the MathVerse benchmark may provide unique insights to guide the future development of MLLMs. Project page: https://mathverse-cuhk.github.io</description>

      <title>LaRE^2: Latent Reconstruction Error Based Method for Diffusion-Generated Image Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of Diffusion Models has dramatically improved image generation quality, making it increasingly difficult to differentiate between real and generated images. This development, while impressive, also raises significant privacy and security concerns. In response to this, we propose a novel Latent REconstruction error guided feature REfinement method (LaRE^2) for detecting the diffusion-generated images. We come up with the Latent Reconstruction Error (LaRE), the first reconstruction-error based feature in the latent space for generated image detection. LaRE surpasses existing methods in terms of feature extraction efficiency while preserving crucial cues required to differentiate between the real and the fake. To exploit LaRE, we propose an Error-Guided feature REfinement module (EGRE), which can refine the image feature guided by LaRE to enhance the discriminativeness of the feature. Our EGRE utilizes an align-then-refine mechanism, which effectively refines the image feature for generated-image detection from both spatial and channel perspectives. Extensive experiments on the large-scale GenImage benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our LaRE^2, which surpasses the best SoTA method by up to 11.9%/12.1% average ACC/AP across 8 different image generators. LaRE also surpasses existing methods in terms of feature extraction cost, delivering an impressive speed enhancement of 8 times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work in reinforcement learning has leveraged symmetries in the model to improve sample efficiency in training a policy. A commonly used simplifying assumption is that the dynamics and reward both exhibit the same symmetry; however, in many real-world environments, the dynamical model exhibits symmetry independent of the reward model. In this paper, we assume only the dynamics exhibit symmetry, extending the scope of problems in reinforcement learning and learning in control theory to which symmetry techniques can be applied. We use Cartan's moving frame method to introduce a technique for learning dynamics that, by construction, exhibit specified symmetries. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method learns a more accurate dynamical model</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reference resolution is an important problem, one that is essential to understand and successfully handle context of different kinds. This context includes both previous turns and context that pertains to non-conversational entities, such as entities on the user's screen or those running in the background. While LLMs have been shown to be extremely powerful for a variety of tasks, their use in reference resolution, particularly for non-conversational entities, remains underutilized. This paper demonstrates how LLMs can be used to create an extremely effective system to resolve references of various types, by showing how reference resolution can be converted into a language modeling problem, despite involving forms of entities like those on screen that are not traditionally conducive to being reduced to a text-only modality. We demonstrate large improvements over an existing system with similar functionality across different types of references, with our smallest model obtaining absolute gains of over 5% for on-screen references. We also benchmark against GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, with our smallest model achieving performance comparable to that of GPT-4, and our larger models substantially outperforming it.</description>

      <title>Heuristic-enhanced Candidates Selection strategy for GPTs tackle Few-Shot Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Few-Shot Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (FSABSA) is an indispensable and highly challenging task in natural language processing. However, methods based on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) struggle to accommodate multiple sub-tasks, and methods based on Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) perform poorly. To address the above issues, the paper designs a Heuristic-enhanced Candidates Selection (HCS) strategy and further proposes All in One (AiO) model based on it. The model works in a two-stage, which simultaneously accommodates the accuracy of PLMs and the generalization capability of GPTs. Specifically, in the first stage, a backbone model based on PLMs generates rough heuristic candidates for the input sentence. In the second stage, AiO leverages LLMs' contextual learning capabilities to generate precise predictions. The study conducted comprehensive comparative and ablation experiments on five benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can better adapt to multiple sub-tasks, and also outperforms the methods that directly utilize GPTs.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Multi-source Domain Adaptation Through Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-source Domain Adaptation (MDA) seeks to adapt models trained on data from multiple labeled source domains to perform effectively on an unlabeled target domain data, assuming access to sources data. To address the challenges of model adaptation and data privacy, we introduce Collaborative MDA Through Optimal Transport (CMDA-OT), a novel framework consisting of two key phases. In the first phase, each source domain is independently adapted to the target domain using optimal transport methods. In the second phase, a centralized collaborative learning architecture is employed, which aggregates the N models from the N sources without accessing their data, thereby safeguarding privacy. During this process, the server leverages a small set of pseudo-labeled samples from the target domain, known as the target validation subset, to refine and guide the adaptation. This dual-phase approach not only improves model performance on the target domain but also addresses vital privacy challenges inherent in domain adaptation.</description>

      <title>Stock Recommendations for Individual Investors: A Temporal Graph Network Approach with Mean-Variance Efficient Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems can be helpful for individuals to make well-informed decisions in complex financial markets. While many studies have focused on predicting stock prices, even advanced models fall short of accurately forecasting them. Additionally, previous studies indicate that individual investors often disregard established investment theories, favoring their personal preferences instead. This presents a challenge for stock recommendation systems, which must not only provide strong investment performance but also respect these individual preferences. To create effective stock recommender systems, three critical elements must be incorporated: 1) individual preferences, 2) portfolio diversification, and 3) the temporal dynamics of the first two. In response, we propose a new model, Portfolio Temporal Graph Network Recommender, PfoTGNRec, which can handle time-varying collaborative signals and incorporates diversification-enhancing sampling. On real-world individual trading data, our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, including cutting-edge dynamic embedding models and existing stock recommendation models. Indeed, we show that PfoTGNRec is an effective solution that can balance customer preferences with the need to suggest portfolios with high Return-on-Investment.

      <title>Latent Guard: a Safety Framework for Text-to-image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the ability to generate high-quality images, text-to-image (T2I) models can be exploited for creating inappropriate content. To prevent misuse, existing safety measures are either based on text blacklists, which can be easily circumvented, or harmful content classification, requiring large datasets for training and offering low flexibility. Hence, we propose Latent Guard, a framework designed to improve safety measures in text-to-image generation. Inspired by blacklist-based approaches, Latent Guard learns a latent space on top of the T2I model's text encoder, where it is possible to check the presence of harmful concepts in the input text embeddings. Our proposed framework is composed of a data generation pipeline specific to the task using large language models, ad-hoc architectural components, and a contrastive learning strategy to benefit from the generated data. The effectiveness of our method is verified on three datasets and against four baselines. Code and data will be shared at https://latentguard.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Compression Represents Intelligence Linearly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a belief that learning to compress well will lead to intelligence. Recently, language modeling has been shown to be equivalent to compression, which offers a compelling rationale for the success of large language models (LLMs): the development of more advanced language models is essentially enhancing compression which facilitates intelligence. Despite such appealing discussions, little empirical evidence is present for the interplay between compression and intelligence. In this work, we examine their relationship in the context of LLMs, treating LLMs as data compressors. Given the abstract concept of "intelligence", we adopt the average downstream benchmark scores as a surrogate, specifically targeting intelligence related to knowledge and commonsense, coding, and mathematical reasoning. Across 12 benchmarks, our study brings together 31 public LLMs that originate from diverse organizations. Remarkably, we find that LLMs' intelligence -- reflected by average benchmark scores -- almost linearly correlates with their ability to compress external text corpora. These results provide concrete evidence supporting the belief that superior compression indicates greater intelligence. Furthermore, our findings suggest that compression efficiency, as an unsupervised metric derived from raw text corpora, serves as a reliable evaluation measure that is linearly associated with the model capabilities. We open-source our compression datasets as well as our data collection pipelines to facilitate future researchers to assess compression properly.</description>

      <title>ORBIT: Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14712v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earth system predictability is challenged by the complexity of environmental dynamics and the multitude of variables involved. Current AI foundation models, although advanced by leveraging large and heterogeneous data, are often constrained by their size and data integration, limiting their effectiveness in addressing the full range of Earth system prediction challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability (ORBIT), an advanced vision transformer model that scales up to 113 billion parameters using a novel hybrid tensor-data orthogonal parallelism technique. As the largest model of its kind, ORBIT surpasses the current climate AI foundation model size by a thousandfold. Performance scaling tests conducted on the Frontier supercomputer have demonstrated that ORBIT achieves 684 petaFLOPS to 1.6 exaFLOPS sustained throughput, with scaling efficiency maintained at 41% to 85% across 49,152 AMD GPUs. These breakthroughs establish new advances in AI-driven climate modeling and demonstrate promise to significantly improve the Earth system predictability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike traditional educational chatbots that rely on pre-programmed responses, large-language model-driven chatbots, such as ChatGPT, demonstrate remarkable versatility to serve as a dynamic resource for addressing student needs from understanding advanced concepts to solving complex problems. This work explores the impact of such technology on student learning in an interdisciplinary, project-oriented data visualization course. Throughout the semester, students engaged with ChatGPT across four distinct projects, designing and implementing data visualizations using a variety of tools such as Tableau, D3, and Vega-lite. We collected conversation logs and reflection surveys after each assignment and conducted interviews with selected students to gain deeper insights into their experiences with ChatGPT. Our analysis examined the advantages and barriers of using ChatGPT, students' querying behavior, the types of assistance sought, and its impact on assignment outcomes and engagement. We discuss design considerations for an educational solution tailored for data visualization education, extending beyond ChatGPT's basic interface.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cooperation through Selective Interaction and Long-term Experiences in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The significance of network structures in promoting group cooperation within social dilemmas has been widely recognized. Prior studies attribute this facilitation to the assortment of strategies driven by spatial interactions. Although reinforcement learning has been employed to investigate the impact of dynamic interaction on the evolution of cooperation, there remains a lack of understanding about how agents develop neighbour selection behaviours and the formation of strategic assortment within an explicit interaction structure. To address this, our study introduces a computational framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning in the spatial Prisoner's Dilemma game. This framework allows agents to select dilemma strategies and interacting neighbours based on their long-term experiences, differing from existing research that relies on preset social norms or external incentives. By modelling each agent using two distinct Q-networks, we disentangle the coevolutionary dynamics between cooperation and interaction. The results indicate that long-term experience enables agents to develop the ability to identify non-cooperative neighbours and exhibit a preference for interaction with cooperative ones. This emergent self-organizing behaviour leads to the clustering of agents with similar strategies, thereby increasing network reciprocity and enhancing group cooperation.</description>

      <title>Causality in the Can: Diet Coke's Impact on Fatness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificially sweetened beverages like Diet Coke are often considered better alternatives to sugary drinks, but the debate over their impact on health, particularly in relation to obesity, continues. Previous research has predominantly used association-based methods with observational or Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) data, which may not accurately capture the causal relationship between Diet Coke consumption and obesity, leading to potentially limited conclusions. In contrast, we employed causal inference methods using structural causal models, integrating both observational and RCT data. Specifically, we utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which includes diverse demographic information, as our observational data source. This data was then used to construct a causal graph, and the back-door criterion, along with its adjustment formula, was applied to estimate the RCT data. We then calculated the counterfactual quantity, the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency (PNS), using both NHANES data and estimated RCT data. We propose that PNS is the essential metric for assessing the impact of Diet Coke on obesity. Our results indicate that between 20 to 50 percent of individuals, especially those with poor dietary habits, are more likely to gain weight from Diet Coke. Conversely, in groups like young females with healthier diets, only a small proportion experience weight gain due to Diet Coke. These findings highlight the influence of individual lifestyle and potential hormonal factors on the varied effects of Diet Coke, providing a new framework for understanding its nutritional impacts on public health.</description>

      <title>MM-Mixing: Multi-Modal Mixing Alignment for 3D Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce MM-Mixing, a multi-modal mixing alignment framework for 3D understanding. MM-Mixing applies mixing-based methods to multi-modal data, preserving and optimizing cross-modal connections while enhancing diversity and improving alignment across modalities. Our proposed two-stage training pipeline combines feature-level and input-level mixing to optimize the 3D encoder. The first stage employs feature-level mixing with contrastive learning to align 3D features with their corresponding modalities. The second stage incorporates both feature-level and input-level mixing, introducing mixed point cloud inputs to further refine 3D feature representations. MM-Mixing enhances intermodality relationships, promotes generalization, and ensures feature consistency while providing diverse and realistic training samples. We demonstrate that MM-Mixing significantly improves baseline performance across various learning scenarios, including zero-shot 3D classification, linear probing 3D classification, and cross-modal 3D shape retrieval. Notably, we improved the zero-shot classification accuracy on ScanObjectNN from 51.3% to 61.9%, and on Objaverse-LVIS from 46.8% to 51.4%. Our findings highlight the potential of multi-modal mixing-based alignment to significantly advance 3D object recognition and understanding while remaining straightforward to implement and integrate into existing frameworks.</description>

      <title>DP-IQA: Utilizing Diffusion Prior for Blind Image Quality Assessment in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19996v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blind image quality assessment (IQA) in the wild, which assesses the quality of images with complex authentic distortions and no reference images, presents significant challenges. Given the difficulty in collecting large-scale training data, leveraging limited data to develop a model with strong generalization remains an open problem. Motivated by the robust image perception capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, we propose a novel IQA method, diffusion priors-based IQA (DP-IQA), to utilize the T2I model's prior for improved performance and generalization ability. Specifically, we utilize pre-trained Stable Diffusion as the backbone, extracting multi-level features from the denoising U-Net guided by prompt embeddings through a tunable text adapter. Simultaneously, an image adapter compensates for information loss introduced by the lossy pre-trained encoder. Unlike T2I models that require full image distribution modeling, our approach targets image quality assessment, which inherently requires fewer parameters. To improve applicability, we distill the knowledge into a lightweight CNN-based student model, significantly reducing parameters while maintaining or even enhancing generalization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that DP-IQA achieves state-of-the-art performance on various in-the-wild datasets, highlighting the superior generalization capability of T2I priors in blind IQA tasks. To our knowledge, DP-IQA is the first method to apply pre-trained diffusion priors in blind IQA. Codes and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/RomGai/DP-IQA.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces the Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard and the Ko-H5 Benchmark as vital tools for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in Korean. Incorporating private test sets while mirroring the English Open LLM Leaderboard, we establish a robust evaluation framework that has been well integrated in the Korean LLM community. We perform data leakage analysis that shows the benefit of private test sets along with a correlation study within the Ko-H5 benchmark and temporal analyses of the Ko-H5 score. Moreover, we present empirical support for the need to expand beyond set benchmarks. We hope the Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard sets precedent for expanding LLM evaluation to foster more linguistic diversity.</description>

      <title>Backpropagation-Free Multi-modal On-Device Model Adaptation via Cloud-Device Collaboration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our increasingly interconnected world, where intelligent devices continually amass copious personalized multi-modal data, a pressing need arises to deliver high-quality, personalized device-aware services. However, this endeavor presents a multifaceted challenge to prevailing artificial intelligence (AI) systems primarily rooted in the cloud. As these systems grapple with shifting data distributions between the cloud and devices, the traditional approach of fine-tuning-based adaptation (FTA) exists the following issues: the costly and time-consuming data annotation required by FTA and the looming risk of model overfitting. To surmount these challenges, we introduce a Universal On-Device Multi-modal Model Adaptation Framework, revolutionizing on-device model adaptation by striking a balance between efficiency and effectiveness. The framework features the Fast Domain Adaptor (FDA) hosted in the cloud, providing tailored parameters for the Lightweight Multi-modal Model on devices. To enhance adaptability across multi-modal tasks, the AnchorFrame Distribution Reasoner (ADR) minimizes communication costs. Our contributions, encapsulated in the Cloud-Device Collaboration Multi-modal Parameter Generation (CDC-MMPG) framework, represent a pioneering solution for on-Device Multi-modal Model Adaptation (DMMA). Extensive experiments validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, particularly in video question answering and retrieval tasks, driving forward the integration of intelligent devices into our daily lives.</description>

      <title>Tackling GenAI Copyright Issues: Originality Estimation and Genericization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress of generative AI technology has sparked significant copyright concerns, leading to numerous lawsuits filed against AI developers. While various techniques for mitigating copyright issues have been studied, significant risks remain. Here, we propose a genericization method that modifies the outputs of a generative model to make them more generic and less likely to infringe copyright. To achieve this, we introduce a metric for quantifying the level of originality of data in a manner that is consistent with the legal framework. This metric can be practically estimated by drawing samples from a generative model, which is then used for the genericization process. As a practical implementation, we introduce PREGen, which combines our genericization method with an existing mitigation technique. Experiments demonstrate that our genericization method successfully modifies the output of a text-to-image generative model so that it produces more generic, copyright-compliant images. PREGen dramatically improves the performance of the existing method, reducing the likelihood of generating copyrighted characters by more than half when the names of copyrighted characters are used as the prompt. Additionally, although generative models have been found to generate copyrighted characters even when the names of characters are not directly mentioned in the prompt, PREGen almost completely suppresses the generation of copyrighted characters for such prompts.</description>

      <title>TokenRec: Learning to Tokenize ID for LLM-based Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in utilizing large-scale language models (LLMs) to advance next-generation Recommender Systems (RecSys), driven by their outstanding language understanding and in-context learning capabilities. In this scenario, tokenizing (i.e., indexing) users and items becomes essential for ensuring a seamless alignment of LLMs with recommendations. While several studies have made progress in representing users and items through textual contents or latent representations, challenges remain in efficiently capturing high-order collaborative knowledge into discrete tokens that are compatible with LLMs. Additionally, the majority of existing tokenization approaches often face difficulties in generalizing effectively to new/unseen users or items that were not in the training corpus. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called TokenRec, which introduces not only an effective ID tokenization strategy but also an efficient retrieval paradigm for LLM-based recommendations. Specifically, our tokenization strategy, Masked Vector-Quantized (MQ) Tokenizer, involves quantizing the masked user/item representations learned from collaborative filtering into discrete tokens, thus achieving a smooth incorporation of high-order collaborative knowledge and a generalizable tokenization of users and items for LLM-based RecSys. Meanwhile, our generative retrieval paradigm is designed to efficiently recommend top-$K$ items for users to eliminate the need for the time-consuming auto-regressive decoding and beam search processes used by LLMs, thus significantly reducing inference time. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating that TokenRec outperforms competitive benchmarks, including both traditional recommender systems and emerging LLM-based recommender systems.</description>

      <title>SLEGO: A Collaborative Data Analytics System with LLM Recommender for Diverse Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the SLEGO (Software-Lego) system, a collaborative analytics platform that bridges the gap between experienced developers and novice users using a cloud-based platform with modular, reusable microservices. These microservices enable developers to share their analytical tools and workflows, while a simple graphical user interface (GUI) allows novice users to build comprehensive analytics pipelines without programming skills. Supported by a knowledge base and a Large Language Model (LLM) powered recommendation system, SLEGO enhances the selection and integration of microservices, increasing the efficiency of analytics pipeline construction. Case studies in finance and machine learning illustrate how SLEGO promotes the sharing and assembly of modular microservices, significantly improving resource reusability and team collaboration. The results highlight SLEGO's role in democratizing data analytics by integrating modular design, knowledge bases, and recommendation systems, fostering a more inclusive and efficient analytical environment.</description>

      <title>Multi-Meta-RAG: Improving RAG for Multi-Hop Queries using Database Filtering with LLM-Extracted Metadata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables retrieval of relevant information from an external knowledge source and allows large language models (LLMs) to answer queries over previously unseen document collections. However, it was demonstrated that traditional RAG applications perform poorly in answering multi-hop questions, which require retrieving and reasoning over multiple elements of supporting evidence. We introduce a new method called Multi-Meta-RAG, which uses database filtering with LLM-extracted metadata to improve the RAG selection of the relevant documents from various sources, relevant to the question. While database filtering is specific to a set of questions from a particular domain and format, we found out that Multi-Meta-RAG greatly improves the results on the MultiHop-RAG benchmark. The code is available at https://github.com/mxpoliakov/Multi-Meta-RAG.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Stream Fusion Approach with One-Class Learning for Audio-Visual Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of developing a robust audio-visual deepfake detection model. In practical use cases, new generation algorithms are continually emerging, and these algorithms are not encountered during the development of detection methods. This calls for the generalization ability of the method. Additionally, to ensure the credibility of detection methods, it is beneficial for the model to interpret which cues from the video indicate it is fake. Motivated by these considerations, we then propose a multi-stream fusion approach with one-class learning as a representation-level regularization technique. We study the generalization problem of audio-visual deepfake detection by creating a new benchmark by extending and re-splitting the existing FakeAVCeleb dataset. The benchmark contains four categories of fake videos (Real Audio-Fake Visual, Fake Audio-Fake Visual, Fake Audio-Real Visual, and Unsynchronized videos). The experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses the previous models by a large margin. Furthermore, our proposed framework offers interpretability, indicating which modality the model identifies as more likely to be fake.

      <title>Timo: Towards Better Temporal Reasoning for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reasoning about time is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand the world. Previous works focus on solving specific tasks, primarily on time-sensitive question answering. While these methods have proven effective, they cannot generalize to a wider spectrum of temporal reasoning tasks. Therefore, we propose a crucial question: Can we build a universal framework to handle a variety of temporal reasoning tasks? To that end, we systematically study 38 temporal reasoning tasks. Based on the observation that 19 tasks are directly related to mathematics, we first leverage the available mathematical dataset to set a solid foundation for temporal reasoning. However, the in-depth study indicates that focusing solely on mathematical enhancement falls short of addressing pure temporal reasoning tasks. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a simple but effective self-critic temporal optimization method to enhance the model's temporal reasoning capabilities without sacrificing general task abilities. Finally, we develop Timo, a model designed to excel in temporal reasoning at the 7B and 13B scales. Notably, Timo outperforms the counterpart LLMs by 10.0 and 7.6 in average accuracy scores and achieves the new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of comparable size. Extensive experiments further validate our framework's effectiveness and its generalization across diverse temporal tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/zhaochen0110/Timo.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Brain Lesion Generation for Effective Data Augmentation of Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate brain lesion delineation is important for planning neurosurgical treatment. Automatic brain lesion segmentation methods based on convolutional neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, neural network performance is constrained by the lack of large-scale well-annotated training datasets. In this manuscript, we propose a comprehensive framework to efficiently generate new samples for training a brain lesion segmentation model. We first train a lesion generator, based on an adversarial autoencoder, in a self-supervised manner. Next, we utilize a novel image composition algorithm, Soft Poisson Blending, to seamlessly combine synthetic lesions and brain images to obtain training samples. Finally, to effectively train the brain lesion segmentation model with augmented images we introduce a new prototype consistence regularization to align real and synthetic features. Our framework is validated by extensive experiments on two public brain lesion segmentation datasets: ATLAS v2.0 and Shift MS. Our method outperforms existing brain image data augmentation schemes. For instance, our method improves the Dice from 50.36% to 60.23% compared to the U-Net with conventional data augmentation techniques for the ATLAS v2.0 dataset.</description>

      <title>AlphaForge: A Framework to Mine and Dynamically Combine Formulaic Alpha Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complexity of financial data, characterized by its variability and low signal-to-noise ratio, necessitates advanced methods in quantitative investment that prioritize both performance and interpretability.Transitioning from early manual extraction to genetic programming, the most advanced approach in the alpha factor mining domain currently employs reinforcement learning to mine a set of combination factors with fixed weights. However, the performance of resultant alpha factors exhibits inconsistency, and the inflexibility of fixed factor weights proves insufficient in adapting to the dynamic nature of financial markets. To address this issue, this paper proposes a two-stage formulaic alpha generating framework AlphaForge, for alpha factor mining and factor combination. This framework employs a generative-predictive neural network to generate factors, leveraging the robust spatial exploration capabilities inherent in deep learning while concurrently preserving diversity. The combination model within the framework incorporates the temporal performance of factors for selection and dynamically adjusts the weights assigned to each component alpha factor. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms contemporary benchmarks in formulaic alpha factor mining. Furthermore, our model exhibits a notable enhancement in portfolio returns within the realm of quantitative investment and real money investment.</description>

      <title>Towards Learning Abductive Reasoning using VSA Distributed Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Abductive Rule Learner with Context-awareness (ARLC), a model that solves abstract reasoning tasks based on Learn-VRF. ARLC features a novel and more broadly applicable training objective for abductive reasoning, resulting in better interpretability and higher accuracy when solving Raven's progressive matrices (RPM). ARLC allows both programming domain knowledge and learning the rules underlying a data distribution. We evaluate ARLC on the I-RAVEN dataset, showcasing state-of-the-art accuracy across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (unseen attribute-rule pairs) tests. ARLC surpasses neuro-symbolic and connectionist baselines, including large language models, despite having orders of magnitude fewer parameters. We show ARLC's robustness to post-programming training by incrementally learning from examples on top of programmed knowledge, which only improves its performance and does not result in catastrophic forgetting of the programmed solution. We validate ARLC's seamless transfer learning from a 2x2 RPM constellation to unseen constellations. Our code is available at https://github.com/IBM/abductive-rule-learner-with-context-awareness.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Struggle in Token-Level Clinical Named Entity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various sectors, including healthcare where they are employed in diverse applications. Their utility is particularly significant in the context of rare diseases, where data scarcity, complexity, and specificity pose considerable challenges. In the clinical domain, Named Entity Recognition (NER) stands out as an essential task and it plays a crucial role in extracting relevant information from clinical texts. Despite the promise of LLMs, current research mostly concentrates on document-level NER, identifying entities in a more general context across entire documents, without extracting their precise location. Additionally, efforts have been directed towards adapting ChatGPT for token-level NER. However, there is a significant research gap when it comes to employing token-level NER for clinical texts, especially with the use of local open-source LLMs. This study aims to bridge this gap by investigating the effectiveness of both proprietary and local LLMs in token-level clinical NER. Essentially, we delve into the capabilities of these models through a series of experiments involving zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and instruction-fine-tuning. Our exploration reveals the inherent challenges LLMs face in token-level NER, particularly in the context of rare diseases, and suggests possible improvements for their application in healthcare. This research contributes to narrowing a significant gap in healthcare informatics and offers insights that could lead to a more refined application of LLMs in the healthcare sector.</description>

      <title>Beyond Instruction Following: Evaluating Inferential Rule Following of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong instruction-following ability, they are further supposed to be controlled and guided by rules in real-world scenarios to be safe, accurate, and intelligent. This demands the possession of inferential rule-following capability of LLMs. However, few works have made a clear evaluation of the inferential rule-following capability of LLMs. Previous studies that try to evaluate the inferential rule-following capability of LLMs fail to distinguish the inferential rule-following scenarios from the instruction-following scenarios. Therefore, this paper first clarifies the concept of inferential rule-following and proposes a comprehensive benchmark, RuleBench, to evaluate a diversified range of inferential rule-following abilities. Our experimental results on a variety of LLMs show that they are still limited in following rules. Our analysis based on the evaluation results provides insights into the improvements for LLMs toward a better inferential rule-following intelligent agent. We further propose Inferential Rule-Following Tuning (IRFT), which outperforms IFT in helping LLMs solve RuleBench. The data and code can be found at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/llm-rule-following-B3E3/</description>

      <title>Adaptive Draft-Verification for Efficient Large Language Model Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) decoding involves generating a sequence of tokens based on a given context, where each token is predicted one at a time using the model's learned probabilities. The typical autoregressive decoding method requires a separate forward pass through the model for each token generated, which is computationally inefficient and poses challenges for deploying LLMs in latency-sensitive scenarios. The main limitations of current decoding methods stem from their inefficiencies and resource demands. Existing approaches either necessitate fine-tuning smaller models, which is resource-intensive, or rely on fixed retrieval schemes to construct drafts for the next tokens, which lack adaptability and fail to generalize across different models and contexts. To address these issues, we introduce a novel methodology called ADED, which accelerates LLM decoding without requiring fine-tuning. Our approach involves an adaptive draft-verification process that evolves over time to improve efficiency. We utilize a tri-gram matrix-based LLM representation to dynamically approximate the output distribution of the LLM, allowing the model to adjust to changing token probabilities during the decoding process. Additionally, we implement a draft construction mechanism that effectively balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring that the drafts generated are both diverse and close to the true output distribution of the LLM. The importance of this design lies in its ability to optimize the draft distribution adaptively, leading to faster and more accurate decoding. Through extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets and LLM architectures, we demonstrate that ADED significantly accelerates the decoding process while maintaining high accuracy, making it suitable for deployment in a wide range of practical applications.</description>

      <title>SmartQuant: CXL-based AI Model Store in Support of Runtime Configurable Weight Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that, during the inference on generative AI models such as transformer, the importance of different weights exhibits substantial context-dependent variations. This naturally manifests a promising potential of adaptively configuring weight quantization to improve the generative AI inference efficiency. Although configurable weight quantization can readily leverage the hardware support of variable-precision arithmetics in modern GPU and AI accelerators, little prior research has studied how one could exploit variable weight quantization to proportionally improve the AI model memory access speed and energy efficiency. Motivated by the rapidly maturing CXL ecosystem, this work develops a CXL-based design solution to fill this gap. The key is to allow CXL memory controllers play an active role in supporting and exploiting runtime configurable weight quantization. Using transformer as a representative generative AI model, we carried out experiments that well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design solution.</description>

      <title>Semantic Prototypes: Enhancing Transparency Without Black Boxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As machine learning (ML) models and datasets increase in complexity, the demand for methods that enhance explainability and interpretability becomes paramount. Prototypes, by encapsulating essential characteristics within data, offer insights that enable tactical decision-making and enhance transparency. Traditional prototype methods often rely on sub-symbolic raw data and opaque latent spaces, reducing explainability and increasing the risk of misinterpretations. This paper presents a novel framework that utilizes semantic descriptions to define prototypes and provide clear explanations, effectively addressing the shortcomings of conventional methods. Our approach leverages concept-based descriptions to cluster data on the semantic level, ensuring that prototypes not only represent underlying properties intuitively but are also straightforward to interpret. Our method simplifies the interpretative process and effectively bridges the gap between complex data structures and human cognitive processes, thereby enhancing transparency and fostering trust. Our approach outperforms existing widely-used prototype methods in facilitating human understanding and informativeness, as validated through a user survey.</description>

      <title>KAN or MLP: A Fairer Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel method. Instead, it offers a fairer and more comprehensive comparison of KAN and MLP models across various tasks, including machine learning, computer vision, audio processing, natural language processing, and symbolic formula representation. Specifically, we control the number of parameters and FLOPs to compare the performance of KAN and MLP. Our main observation is that, except for symbolic formula representation tasks, MLP generally outperforms KAN. We also conduct ablation studies on KAN and find that its advantage in symbolic formula representation mainly stems from its B-spline activation function. When B-spline is applied to MLP, performance in symbolic formula representation significantly improves, surpassing or matching that of KAN. However, in other tasks where MLP already excels over KAN, B-spline does not substantially enhance MLP's performance. Furthermore, we find that KAN's forgetting issue is more severe than that of MLP in a standard class-incremental continual learning setting, which differs from the findings reported in the KAN paper. We hope these results provide insights for future research on KAN and other MLP alternatives. Project link: https://github.com/yu-rp/KANbeFair</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computer vision (CV) is one of the most crucial fields in artificial intelligence. In recent years, a variety of deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers have been designed to tackle diverse problems in CV. These algorithms have found practical applications in areas such as robotics and facial recognition. Despite the increasing power of current CV models, several fundamental questions remain unresolved: Why do CNNs require deep layers? What ensures the generalization ability of CNNs? Why do residual-based networks outperform fully convolutional networks like VGG? What is the fundamental difference between residual-based CNNs and Transformer-based networks? Why can CNNs utilize LoRA and pruning techniques? The root cause of these questions lies in the lack of a robust theoretical foundation for deep learning models in CV. To address these critical issues and techniques, we employ the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT) to provide a theoretical basis for convolution- and Transformer-based models in CV. By doing so, we aim to elucidate these questions from a theoretical perspective.</description>

      <title>A Crowding Distance That Provably Solves the Difficulties of the NSGA-II in Many-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical works have shown that the NSGA-II can have enormous difficulties to solve problems with more than two objectives. In contrast, algorithms like the NSGA-III or SMS-EMOA, differing from the NSGA-II only in the secondary selection criterion, provably perform well in these situations.
  To remedy this shortcoming of the NSGA-II, but at the same time keep the advantages of the widely accepted crowding distance, we use the insights of these previous work to define a variant of the crowding distance, called truthful crowding distance. Different from the classic crowding distance, it has for any number of objectives the desirable property that a small crowding distance value indicates that some other solution has a similar objective vector.
  Building on this property, we conduct mathematical runtime analyses for the NSGA-II with truthful crowding distance. We show that this algorithm can solve the many-objective versions of the OneMinMax, COCZ, LOTZ, and OJZJ$_k$ problems in the same (polynomial) asymptotic runtimes as the NSGA-III and the SMS-EMOA. This contrasts the exponential lower bounds previously shown for the classic NSGA-II. For the bi-objective versions of these problems, our NSGA-II has a similar performance as the classic NSGA-II, gaining however from smaller admissible population sizes. For the bi-objective OneMinMax problem, we also observe a (minimally) better performance in approximating the Pareto front.
  These results suggest that our truthful version of the NSGA-II has the same good performance as the classic NSGA-II in two objectives, but can resolve the drastic problems in more than two objectives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a pervasive mental health condition that affects 300 million people worldwide. This work presents a novel, BiLSTM-based tri-modal model-level fusion architecture for the binary classification of depression from clinical interview recordings. The proposed architecture incorporates Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, Facial Action Units, and uses a two-shot learning based GPT-4 model to process text data. This is the first work to incorporate large language models into a multi-modal architecture for this task. It achieves impressive results on the DAIC-WOZ AVEC 2016 Challenge cross-validation split and Leave-One-Subject-Out cross-validation split, surpassing all baseline models and multiple state-of-the-art models. In Leave-One-Subject-Out testing, it achieves an accuracy of 91.01%, an F1-Score of 85.95%, a precision of 80%, and a recall of 92.86%.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Representation Enhanced Temporal Flow Fusion Model for Long-Term Workload Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate workload forecasting is critical for efficient resource management in cloud computing systems, enabling effective scheduling and autoscaling. Despite recent advances with transformer-based forecasting models, challenges remain due to the non-stationary, nonlinear characteristics of workload time series and the long-term dependencies. In particular, inconsistent performance between long-term history and near-term forecasts hinders long-range predictions. This paper proposes a novel framework leveraging self-supervised multiscale representation learning to capture both long-term and near-term workload patterns. The long-term history is encoded through multiscale representations while the near-term observations are modeled via temporal flow fusion. These representations of different scales are fused using an attention mechanism and characterized with normalizing flows to handle non-Gaussian/non-linear distributions of time series. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmarks demonstrate superiority over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Reverse Map Projections as Equivariant Quantum Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the novel class $(E_\alpha)_{\alpha \in [-\infty,1)}$ of reverse map projection embeddings, each one defining a unique new method of encoding classical data into quantum states. Inspired by well-known map projections from the unit sphere onto its tangent planes, used in practice in cartography, these embeddings address the common drawback of the amplitude embedding method, wherein scalar multiples of data points are identified and information about the norm of data is lost.
  We show how reverse map projections can be utilised as equivariant embeddings for quantum machine learning. Using these methods, we can leverage symmetries in classical datasets to significantly strengthen performance on quantum machine learning tasks.
  Finally, we select four values of $\alpha$ with which to perform a simple classification task, taking $E_\alpha$ as the embedding and experimenting with both equivariant and non-equivariant setups. We compare their results alongside those of standard amplitude embedding.</description>

      <title>GABInsight: Exploring Gender-Activity Binding Bias in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are intensively used in many downstream tasks, including those requiring assessments of individuals appearing in the images. While VLMs perform well in simple single-person scenarios, in real-world applications, we often face complex situations in which there are persons of different genders doing different activities. We show that in such cases, VLMs are biased towards identifying the individual with the expected gender (according to ingrained gender stereotypes in the model or other forms of sample selection bias) as the performer of the activity. We refer to this bias in associating an activity with the gender of its actual performer in an image or text as the Gender-Activity Binding (GAB) bias and analyze how this bias is internalized in VLMs. To assess this bias, we have introduced the GAB dataset with approximately 5500 AI-generated images that represent a variety of activities, addressing the scarcity of real-world images for some scenarios. To have extensive quality control, the generated images are evaluated for their diversity, quality, and realism. We have tested 12 renowned pre-trained VLMs on this dataset in the context of text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval to measure the effect of this bias on their predictions. Additionally, we have carried out supplementary experiments to quantify the bias in VLMs' text encoders and to evaluate VLMs' capability to recognize activities. Our experiments indicate that VLMs experience an average performance decline of about 13.2% when confronted with gender-activity binding bias.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Partially Spoofed Audio Localization with Boundary-aware Attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of partially spoofed audio localization aims to accurately determine audio authenticity at a frame level. Although some works have achieved encouraging results, utilizing boundary information within a single model remains an unexplored research topic. In this work, we propose a novel method called Boundary-aware Attention Mechanism (BAM). Specifically, it consists of two core modules: Boundary Enhancement and Boundary Frame-wise Attention. The former assembles the intra-frame and inter-frame information to extract discriminative boundary features that are subsequently used for boundary position detection and authenticity decision, while the latter leverages boundary prediction results to explicitly control the feature interaction between frames, which achieves effective discrimination between real and fake frames. Experimental results on PartialSpoof database demonstrate our proposed method achieves the best performance. The code is available at https://github.com/media-sec-lab/BAM.</description>

      <title>Universal Approximation Theory: Foundations for Parallelism in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21670v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are increasingly evolving towards training large models with big data, a method that has demonstrated superior performance across many tasks. However, this approach introduces an urgent problem: current deep learning models are predominantly serial, meaning that as the number of network layers increases, so do the training and inference times. This is unacceptable if deep learning is to continue advancing. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning parallelization strategy based on the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT). From this foundation, we designed a parallel network called Para-Former to test our theory. Unlike traditional serial models, the inference time of Para-Former does not increase with the number of layers, significantly accelerating the inference speed of multi-layer networks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this network.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Mamba</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning, as a vital technique, has sparked a notable revolution in artificial intelligence. As the most representative architecture, Transformers have empowered numerous advanced models, especially the large language models that comprise billions of parameters, becoming a cornerstone in deep learning. Despite the impressive achievements, Transformers still face inherent limitations, particularly the time-consuming inference resulting from the quadratic computation complexity of attention calculation. Recently, a novel architecture named Mamba, drawing inspiration from classical state space models, has emerged as a promising alternative for building foundation models, delivering comparable modeling abilities to Transformers while preserving near-linear scalability concerning sequence length. This has sparked an increasing number of studies actively exploring Mamba's potential to achieve impressive performance across diverse domains. Given such rapid evolution, there is a critical need for a systematic review that consolidates existing Mamba-empowered models, offering a comprehensive understanding of this emerging model architecture. In this survey, we therefore conduct an in-depth investigation of recent Mamba-associated studies, covering from three main aspects: the advancements of Mamba-based models, the techniques of adapting Mamba to diverse data, and the applications where Mamba can excel. Specifically, we first recall the foundational knowledge of various representative deep learning models and the details of Mamba as preliminaries. Then, to showcase the significance of Mamba, we comprehensively review the related studies focusing on Mamba models' architecture design, data adaptability, and applications. Finally, we present an discussion of current limitations and explore various promising research directions to provide deeper insights for future investigations.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning-based Chaining-Cluster for Multilingual Voice-Face Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The innate correlation between a person's face and voice has recently emerged as a compelling area of study, especially within the context of multilingual environments. This paper introduces our novel solution to the Face-Voice Association in Multilingual Environments (FAME) 2024 challenge, focusing on a contrastive learning-based chaining-cluster method to enhance face-voice association. This task involves the challenges of building biometric relations between auditory and visual modality cues and modelling the prosody interdependence between different languages while addressing both intrinsic and extrinsic variability present in the data. To handle these non-trivial challenges, our method employs supervised cross-contrastive (SCC) learning to establish robust associations between voices and faces in multi-language scenarios. Following this, we have specifically designed a chaining-cluster-based post-processing step to mitigate the impact of outliers often found in unconstrained in the wild data. We conducted extensive experiments to investigate the impact of language on face-voice association. The overall results were evaluated on the FAME public evaluation platform, where we achieved 2nd place. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our method, and we validate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed approach.

      <title>KnowPO: Knowledge-aware Preference Optimization for Controllable Knowledge Selection in Retrieval-Augmented Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By integrating external knowledge, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become an effective strategy for mitigating the hallucination problems that large language models (LLMs) encounter when dealing with knowledge-intensive tasks. However, in the process of integrating external non-parametric supporting evidence with internal parametric knowledge, inevitable knowledge conflicts may arise, leading to confusion in the model's responses. To enhance the knowledge selection of LLMs in various contexts, some research has focused on refining their behavior patterns through instruction-tuning. Nonetheless, due to the absence of explicit negative signals and comparative objectives, models fine-tuned in this manner may still exhibit undesirable behaviors such as contextual ignorance and contextual overinclusion. To this end, we propose a Knowledge-aware Preference Optimization strategy, dubbed KnowPO, aimed at achieving adaptive knowledge selection based on contextual relevance in real retrieval scenarios. Concretely, we proposed a general paradigm for constructing knowledge conflict datasets, which comprehensively cover various error types and learn how to avoid these negative signals through preference optimization methods. Simultaneously, we proposed a rewriting strategy and data ratio optimization strategy to address preference imbalances. Experimental results show that KnowPO outperforms previous methods for handling knowledge conflicts by over 37\%, while also exhibiting robust generalization across various out-of-distribution datasets.</description>

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have shown potential as an alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in neural networks, providing universal function approximation with fewer parameters and reduced memory usage. In this paper, we explore the use of KANs as function approximators within the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. We evaluate this approach by comparing its performance to the original MLP-based PPO using the DeepMind Control Proprio Robotics benchmark. Our results indicate that the KAN-based reinforcement learning algorithm can achieve comparable performance to its MLP-based counterpart, often with fewer parameters. These findings suggest that KANs may offer a more efficient option for reinforcement learning models.</description>

      <title>Order Matters in Hallucination: Reasoning Order as Benchmark and Reflexive Prompting for Large-Language-Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have generated significant attention since their inception, finding applications across various academic and industrial domains. However, these models often suffer from the "hallucination problem", where outputs, though grammatically and logically coherent, lack factual accuracy or are entirely fabricated. A particularly troubling issue discovered and widely discussed recently is the numerical comparison error where multiple LLMs incorrectly infer that "9.11$&gt;$9.9". We discovered that the order in which LLMs generate answers and reasoning impacts their consistency. Specifically, results vary significantly when an LLM generates an answer first and then provides the reasoning versus generating the reasoning process first and then the conclusion. Inspired by this, we propose a new benchmark method for assessing LLM consistency: comparing responses generated through these two different approaches. This benchmark effectively identifies instances where LLMs fabricate answers and subsequently generate justifications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel and straightforward prompt strategy designed to mitigate this issue. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy improves performance across various LLMs compared to direct questioning. This work not only sheds light on a critical flaw in LLMs but also offers a practical solution to enhance their reliability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are an unsupervised method for learning a sparse decomposition of a neural network's latent representations into seemingly interpretable features. Despite recent excitement about their potential, research applications outside of industry are limited by the high cost of training a comprehensive suite of SAEs. In this work, we introduce Gemma Scope, an open suite of JumpReLU SAEs trained on all layers and sub-layers of Gemma 2 2B and 9B and select layers of Gemma 2 27B base models. We primarily train SAEs on the Gemma 2 pre-trained models, but additionally release SAEs trained on instruction-tuned Gemma 2 9B for comparison. We evaluate the quality of each SAE on standard metrics and release these results. We hope that by releasing these SAE weights, we can help make more ambitious safety and interpretability research easier for the community.

      <title>PhaGO: Protein function annotation for bacteriophages by integrating the genomic context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bacteriophages are viruses that target bacteria, playing a crucial role in microbial ecology. Phage proteins are important in understanding phage biology, such as virus infection, replication, and evolution. Although a large number of new phages have been identified via metagenomic sequencing, many of them have limited protein function annotation. Accurate function annotation of phage proteins presents several challenges, including their inherent diversity and the scarcity of annotated ones. Existing tools have yet to fully leverage the unique properties of phages in annotating protein functions. In this work, we propose a new protein function annotation tool for phages by leveraging the modular genomic structure of phage genomes. By employing embeddings from the latest protein foundation models and Transformer to capture contextual information between proteins in phage genomes, PhaGO surpasses state-of-the-art methods in annotating diverged proteins and proteins with uncommon functions by 6.78% and 13.05% improvement, respectively. PhaGO can annotate proteins lacking homology search results, which is critical for characterizing the rapidly accumulating phage genomes. We demonstrate the utility of PhaGO by identifying 688 potential holins in phages, which exhibit high structural conservation with known holins. The results show the potential of PhaGO to extend our understanding of newly discovered phages.</description>

      <title>DiffLoRA: Generating Personalized Low-Rank Adaptation Weights with Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation has gained significant attention for its capability to generate high-fidelity portraits of specific identities conditioned on user-defined prompts. Existing methods typically involve test-time fine-tuning or instead incorporating an additional pre-trained branch. However, these approaches struggle to simultaneously address the demands of efficiency, identity fidelity, and preserving the model's original generative capabilities. In this paper, we propose DiffLoRA, a novel approach that leverages diffusion models as a hypernetwork to predict personalized low-rank adaptation (LoRA) weights based on the reference images. By integrating these LoRA weights into the text-to-image model, DiffLoRA achieves personalization during inference without further training. Additionally, we propose an identity-oriented LoRA weight construction pipeline to facilitate the training of DiffLoRA.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a pioneering Dynamic Hypergraph Networks (DHCE) model designed to predict future medical diagnoses from electronic health records with enhanced accuracy. The DHCE model innovates by identifying and differentiating acute and chronic diseases within a patient's visit history, constructing dynamic hypergraphs that capture the complex, high-order interactions between diseases. It surpasses traditional recurrent neural networks and graph neural networks by effectively integrating clinical event data, reflected through medical language model-assisted encoding, into a robust patient representation. Through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, the DHCE model exhibits superior performance, significantly outpacing established baseline models in the precision of sequential diagnosis prediction.</description>

      <title>Post-Training Sparse Attention with Double Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inference process for large language models is slow and memory-intensive, with one of the most critical bottlenecks being excessive Key-Value (KV) cache accesses. This paper introduces "Double Sparsity," a novel post-training sparse attention technique designed to alleviate this bottleneck by reducing KV cache access. Double Sparsity combines token sparsity, which focuses on utilizing only the important tokens for computing self-attention, with channel sparsity, an approach that uses important feature channels for identifying important tokens. Our key insight is that the pattern of channel sparsity is relatively static, allowing us to use offline calibration to make it efficient at runtime, thereby enabling accurate and efficient identification of important tokens. Moreover, this method can be combined with offloading to achieve significant memory usage reduction. Experimental results demonstrate that Double Sparsity can achieve $\frac{1}{16}$ token and channel sparsity with minimal impact on accuracy across various tasks, including wiki-2 perplexity, key-value retrieval, and long context benchmarks with models including Llama-2-7B, Llama-2-70B, and Mixtral-8x7B. It brings up to a 14.1$\times$ acceleration in attention operations and a 1.9$\times$ improvement in end-to-end inference on GPUs. With offloading, it achieves a decoding speed acceleration of 16.3$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art solutions at a sequence length of 256K. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/andy-yang-1/DoubleSparse.</description>

      <title>Scene-wise Adaptive Network for Dynamic Cold-start Scenes Optimization in CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of modern mobile E-commerce, providing users with nearby commercial service recommendations through location-based online services has become increasingly vital. While machine learning approaches have shown promise in multi-scene recommendation, existing methodologies often struggle to address cold-start problems in unprecedented scenes: the increasing diversity of commercial choices, along with the short online lifespan of scenes, give rise to the complexity of effective recommendations in online and dynamic scenes. In this work, we propose Scene-wise Adaptive Network (SwAN), a novel approach that emphasizes high-performance cold-start online recommendations for new scenes. Our approach introduces several crucial capabilities, including scene similarity learning, user-specific scene transition cognition, scene-specific information construction for the new scene, and enhancing the diverged logical information between scenes. We demonstrate SwAN's potential to optimize dynamic multi-scene recommendation problems by effectively online handling cold-start recommendations for any newly arrived scenes. More encouragingly, SwAN has been successfully deployed in Meituan's online catering recommendation service, which serves millions of customers per day, and SwAN has achieved a 5.64% CTR index improvement relative to the baselines and a 5.19% increase in daily order volume proportion.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) for Time Series Classification and Robust Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) has recently attracted significant attention as a promising alternative to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Despite their theoretical appeal, KAN require validation on large-scale benchmark datasets. Time series data, which has become increasingly prevalent in recent years, especially univariate time series are naturally suited for validating KAN. Therefore, we conducted a fair comparison among KAN, MLP, and mixed structures. The results indicate that KAN can achieve performance comparable to, or even slightly better than, MLP across 128 time series datasets. We also performed an ablation study on KAN, revealing that the output is primarily determined by the base component instead of b-spline function. Furthermore, we assessed the robustness of these models and found that KAN and the hybrid structure MLP\_KAN exhibit significant robustness advantages, attributed to their lower Lipschitz constants. This suggests that KAN and KAN layers hold strong potential to be robust models or to improve the adversarial robustness of other models.</description>

      <title>Sum-Product-Set Networks: Deep Tractable Models for Tree-Structured Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Daily internet communication relies heavily on tree-structured graphs, embodied by popular data formats such as XML and JSON. However, many recent generative (probabilistic) models utilize neural networks to learn a probability distribution over undirected cyclic graphs. This assumption of a generic graph structure brings various computational challenges, and, more importantly, the presence of non-linearities in neural networks does not permit tractable probabilistic inference. We address these problems by proposing sum-product-set networks, an extension of probabilistic circuits from unstructured tensor data to tree-structured graph data. To this end, we use random finite sets to reflect a variable number of nodes and edges in the graph and to allow for exact and efficient inference. We demonstrate that our tractable model performs comparably to various intractable models based on neural networks.</description>

      <title>MagicFace: Training-free Universal-Style Human Image Customized Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for human image customized synthesis typically require tedious training on large-scale datasets. In such cases, they are prone to overfitting and struggle to personalize individuals of unseen styles. Moreover, these methods extensively focus on single-concept human image synthesis and lack the flexibility needed for customizing individuals with multiple given concepts, thereby impeding their broader practical application. To this end, we propose MagicFace, a novel training-free method for universal-style human image personalized synthesis, enabling multi-concept customization by accurately integrating reference concept features into their latent generated region at the pixel level. Specifically, MagicFace introduces a coarse-to-fine generation pipeline, involving two sequential stages: semantic layout construction and concept feature injection. This is achieved by our Reference-aware Self-Attention (RSA) and Region-grouped Blend Attention (RBA) mechanisms. In the first stage, RSA enables the latent image to query features from all reference concepts simultaneously, extracting the overall semantic understanding to facilitate the initial semantic layout establishment. In the second stage, we employ an attention-based semantic segmentation method to pinpoint the latent generated regions of all concepts at each step. Following this, RBA divides the pixels of the latent image into semantic groups, with each group querying fine-grained features from the corresponding reference concept, which ensures precise attribute alignment and feature injection. Throughout the generation process, a weighted mask strategy is employed to ensure the model focuses more on the reference concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MagicFace in both human-centric subject-to-image synthesis and multi-concept human image customization.</description>

      <title>RandomNet: Clustering Time Series Using Untrained Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are widely used in machine learning and data mining. Typically, these networks need to be trained, implying the adjustment of weights (parameters) within the network based on the input data. In this work, we propose a novel approach, RandomNet, that employs untrained deep neural networks to cluster time series. RandomNet uses different sets of random weights to extract diverse representations of time series and then ensembles the clustering relationships derived from these different representations to build the final clustering results. By extracting diverse representations, our model can effectively handle time series with different characteristics. Since all parameters are randomly generated, no training is required during the process. We provide a theoretical analysis of the effectiveness of the method. To validate its performance, we conduct extensive experiments on all of the 128 datasets in the well-known UCR time series archive and perform statistical analysis of the results. These datasets have different sizes, sequence lengths, and they are from diverse fields. The experimental results show that the proposed method is competitive compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>RAGChecker: A Fine-grained Framework for Diagnosing Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) showing promising capability in leveraging external knowledge, a comprehensive evaluation of RAG systems is still challenging due to the modular nature of RAG, evaluation of long-form responses and reliability of measurements. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained evaluation framework, RAGChecker, that incorporates a suite of diagnostic metrics for both the retrieval and generation modules. Meta evaluation verifies that RAGChecker has significantly better correlations with human judgments than other evaluation metrics. Using RAGChecker, we evaluate 8 RAG systems and conduct an in-depth analysis of their performance, revealing insightful patterns and trade-offs in the design choices of RAG architectures. The metrics of RAGChecker can guide researchers and practitioners in developing more effective RAG systems.

      <title>Decoding the human brain tissue response to radiofrequency excitation using a biophysical-model-free deep MRI on a chip framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) relies on radiofrequency (RF) excitation of proton spin. Clinical diagnosis requires a comprehensive collation of biophysical data via multiple MRI contrasts, acquired using a series of RF sequences that lead to lengthy examinations. Here, we developed a vision transformer-based framework that captures the spatiotemporal magnetic signal evolution and decodes the brain tissue response to RF excitation, constituting an MRI on a chip. Following a per-subject rapid calibration scan (28.2 s), a wide variety of image contrasts including fully quantitative molecular, water relaxation, and magnetic field maps can be generated automatically. The method was validated across healthy subjects and a cancer patient in two different imaging sites, and proved to be 94% faster than alternative protocols. The deep MRI on a chip (DeepMonC) framework may reveal the molecular composition of the human brain tissue in a wide range of pathologies, while offering clinically attractive scan times.</description>

      <title>MAT-SED: A Masked Audio Transformer with Masked-Reconstruction Based Pre-training for Sound Event Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sound event detection (SED) methods that leverage a large pre-trained Transformer encoder network have shown promising performance in recent DCASE challenges. However, they still rely on an RNN-based context network to model temporal dependencies, largely due to the scarcity of labeled data. In this work, we propose a pure Transformer-based SED model with masked-reconstruction based pre-training, termed MAT-SED. Specifically, a Transformer with relative positional encoding is first designed as the context network, pre-trained by the masked-reconstruction task on all available target data in a self-supervised way. Both the encoder and the context network are jointly fine-tuned in a semi-supervised manner. Furthermore, a global-local feature fusion strategy is proposed to enhance the localization capability. Evaluation of MAT-SED on DCASE2023 task4 surpasses state-of-the-art performance, achieving 0.587/0.896 PSDS1/PSDS2 respectively.</description>

      <title>SC-Rec: Enhancing Generative Retrieval with Self-Consistent Reranking for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly employed in recommendation systems due to their advanced language understanding and generation capabilities. Recent recommender systems based on generative retrieval have leveraged the inferential abilities of LMs to directly generate the index tokens of the next item, based on item sequences within the user's interaction history. Previous studies have mostly focused on item indices based solely on textual semantic or collaborative information. However, although the standalone effectiveness of these aspects has been demonstrated, the integration of this information has remained unexplored. Our in-depth analysis finds that there is a significant difference in the knowledge captured by the model from heterogeneous item indices and diverse input prompts, which can have a high potential for complementarity. In this paper, we propose SC-Rec, a unified recommender system that learns diverse preference knowledge from two distinct item indices and multiple prompt templates. Furthermore, SC-Rec adopts a novel reranking strategy that aggregates a set of ranking results, inferred based on different indices and prompts, to achieve the self-consistency of the model. Our empirical evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates that SC-Rec considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for sequential recommendation, effectively incorporating complementary knowledge from varied outputs of the model.</description>

      <title>Constructing Domain-Specific Evaluation Sets for LLM-as-a-judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the landscape of machine learning, yet current benchmarks often fall short in capturing the diverse behavior of these models in real-world applications. A benchmark's usefulness is determined by its ability to clearly differentiate between models of varying capabilities (separability) and closely align with human preferences. Existing frameworks like Alpaca-Eval 2.0 LC \cite{dubois2024lengthcontrolledalpacaevalsimpleway} and Arena-Hard v0.1 \cite{li2024crowdsourced} are limited by their focus on general-purpose queries and lack of diversity across domains such as law, medicine, and multilingual contexts. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing a novel data pipeline that curates diverse, domain-specific evaluation sets tailored for LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks. Our approach leverages a combination of manual curation, semi-supervised learning to generate clusters, and stratified sampling to ensure balanced representation across a wide range of domains and languages. The resulting evaluation set, which includes 1573 samples across 14 categories, demonstrates high separability (84\%) across ten top-ranked models, and agreement (84\%) with Chatbot Arena and (0.915) Spearman correlation. The agreement values are 9\% better than Arena Hard and 20\% better than AlpacaEval 2.0 LC, while the Spearman coefficient is 0.7 more than the next best benchmark, showcasing a significant improvement in the usefulness of the benchmark. We further provide an open-source evaluation tool that enables fine-grained analysis of model performance across user-defined categories, offering valuable insights for practitioners. This work contributes to the ongoing effort to enhance the transparency, diversity, and effectiveness of LLM evaluation methodologies.</description>
