      <title>Enhancing Large Language Model Efficiencyvia Symbolic Compression: A Formal Approach Towards Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant token efficiency bottlenecks in code generation and logical reasoning tasks, a challenge that directly impacts inference cost and model interpretability. This paper proposes a formal framework based on symbolic compression,integrating combinatory logic, information-theoretic optimal encoding, and context-aware inference techniques to achieve a step-change improvement in token efficiency while preserving semantic integrity. We establish a mathematical framework within a functional programming paradigm, derive the quantitative relationship between symbolic density and model interpretability, and propose a differentiable compression factor metric to evaluate encoding efficiency. Furthermore, we leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to achieve a low-cost application of the GAEL language. Experimental results show that this method achieves a 78.3% token compression rate in code generation tasks while improving logical traceability by 62% through structural explicitness. This research provides new theoretical tools for efficient inference in LLMs and opens a symbolic path for modelinterpretability research.</description>

      <title>Simulation Streams: A Programming Paradigm for Controlling Large Language Models and Building Complex Systems with Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Simulation Streams, a programming paradigm designed to efficiently control and leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex, dynamic simulations and agentic workflows. Our primary goal is to create a minimally interfering framework that harnesses the agentic abilities of LLMs while addressing their limitations in maintaining consistency, selectively ignoring/including information, and enforcing strict world rules. Simulation Streams achieves this through a state-based approach where variables are modified in sequential steps by "operators," producing output on a recurring format and adhering to consistent rules for state variables. This approach focus the LLMs on defined tasks, while aiming to have the context stream remain "in-distribution". The approach incorporates an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture to write programs in a more intuitive manner, facilitating reuse of workflows across different components and entities. This ECS approach enhances the modularity of the output stream, allowing for complex, multi-entity simulations while maintaining format consistency, information control, and rule enforcement. It is supported by a custom editor that aids in creating, running, and analyzing simulations. We demonstrate the versatility of simulation streams through an illustrative example of an ongoing market economy simulation, a social simulation of three characters playing a game of catch in a park and a suite of classical reinforcement learning benchmark tasks. These examples showcase Simulation Streams' ability to handle complex, evolving scenarios over 100s-1000s of iterations, facilitate comparisons between different agent workflows and models, and maintain consistency and continued interesting developments in LLM-driven simulations.</description>

      <title>LLM-Generated Heuristics for AI Planning: Do We Even Need Domain-Independence Anymore?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain-independent heuristics have long been a cornerstone of AI planning, offering general solutions applicable across a wide range of tasks without requiring domain-specific engineering. However, the advent of large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to generate heuristics tailored to specific planning problems, potentially challenging the necessity of domain independence as a strict design principle. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to automatically derive planning heuristics from task descriptions represented as successor generators and goal tests written in general purpose programming language. We investigate the trade-offs between domain-specific LLM-generated heuristics and traditional domain-independent methods in terms of computational efficiency and explainability. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can create heuristics that achieve state-of-the-art performance on some standard IPC domains, as well as their ability to solve problems that lack an adequate Planning Domain Definition Language ({\sc pddl}) representation. We discuss whether these results signify a paradigm shift and how they can complement existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Reasoning Gap: Small LLMs Can Plan with Generalised Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in the reasoning skills of Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate an increase in the ability of LLMs to solve simple planning tasks. However, as long as the driving force behind improved reasoning capability is the size and complexity of the model, the financial and computational costs associated with running them will also increase. This trend raises questions about continued accessibility and whether these improvements will increase at the same pace as models continue to grow in size and expense. We propose two approaches to enhance the reasoning ability of less resource-intensive LLMs. (1) Provide them with a generalised strategy for solving tasks within a given domain, generated by a more resource-intensive LLM. (2) Exploit their cost-effectiveness by iteratively prompting these models to correct errors in their proposed solutions. Our empirical results from planning and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that these methods improve the performance of less resource-intensive LLMs to levels comparable with their more resource-intensive counterparts, at a fraction of the cost. Additionally, we show that the utilisation of generalised strategies in our experiments reduced the cost of the less resource-intensive model by nearly 30 percent on average.</description>

      <title>Language Games as the Pathway to Artificial Superhuman Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of large language models (LLMs) toward artificial superhuman intelligence (ASI) hinges on data reproduction, a cyclical process in which models generate, curate and retrain on novel data to refine capabilities. Current methods, however, risk getting stuck in a data reproduction trap: optimizing outputs within fixed human-generated distributions in a closed loop leads to stagnation, as models merely recombine existing knowledge rather than explore new frontiers. In this paper, we propose language games as a pathway to expanded data reproduction, breaking this cycle through three mechanisms: (1) \textit{role fluidity}, which enhances data diversity and coverage by enabling multi-agent systems to dynamically shift roles across tasks; (2) \textit{reward variety}, embedding multiple feedback criteria that can drive complex intelligent behaviors; and (3) \textit{rule plasticity}, iteratively evolving interaction constraints to foster learnability, thereby injecting continual novelty. By scaling language games into global sociotechnical ecosystems, human-AI co-evolution generates unbounded data streams that drive open-ended exploration. This framework redefines data reproduction not as a closed loop but as an engine for superhuman intelligence.</description>

      <title>PathE: Leveraging Entity-Agnostic Paths for Parameter-Efficient Knowledge Graph Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) store human knowledge in the form of entities (nodes) and relations, and are used extensively in various applications. KG embeddings are an effective approach to addressing tasks like knowledge discovery, link prediction, and reasoning. This is often done by allocating and learning embedding tables for all or a subset of the entities. As this scales linearly with the number of entities, learning embedding models in real-world KGs with millions of nodes can be computationally intractable. To address this scalability problem, our model, PathE, only allocates embedding tables for relations (which are typically orders of magnitude fewer than the entities) and requires less than 25% of the parameters of previous parameter efficient methods. Rather than storing entity embeddings, we learn to compute them by leveraging multiple entity-relation paths to contextualise individual entities within triples. Evaluated on four benchmarks, PathE achieves state-of-the-art performance in relation prediction, and remains competitive in link prediction on path-rich KGs while training on consumer-grade hardware. We perform ablation experiments to test our design choices and analyse the sensitivity of the model to key hyper-parameters. PathE is efficient and cost-effective for relationally diverse and well-connected KGs commonly found in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Logical Modalities within the European AI Act: An Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the European AI Act in terms of its logical modalities, with the aim of preparing its formal representation, for example, within the logic-pluralistic Knowledge Engineering Framework and Methodology (LogiKEy). LogiKEy develops computational tools for normative reasoning based on formal methods, employing Higher-Order Logic (HOL) as a unifying meta-logic to integrate diverse logics through shallow semantic embeddings. This integration is facilitated by Isabelle/HOL, a proof assistant tool equipped with several automated theorem provers. The modalities within the AI Act and the logics suitable for their representation are discussed. For a selection of these logics, embeddings in HOL are created, which are then used to encode sample paragraphs. Initial experiments evaluate the suitability of these embeddings for automated reasoning, and highlight key challenges on the way to more robust reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Imitation Game for Adversarial Disillusion with Multimodal Generative Chain-of-Thought Role-Play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the cornerstone of artificial intelligence, machine perception confronts a fundamental threat posed by adversarial illusions. These adversarial attacks manifest in two primary forms: deductive illusion, where specific stimuli are crafted based on the victim model's general decision logic, and inductive illusion, where the victim model's general decision logic is shaped by specific stimuli. The former exploits the model's decision boundaries to create a stimulus that, when applied, interferes with its decision-making process. The latter reinforces a conditioned reflex in the model, embedding a backdoor during its learning phase that, when triggered by a stimulus, causes aberrant behaviours. The multifaceted nature of adversarial illusions calls for a unified defence framework, addressing vulnerabilities across various forms of attack. In this study, we propose a disillusion paradigm based on the concept of an imitation game. At the heart of the imitation game lies a multimodal generative agent, steered by chain-of-thought reasoning, which observes, internalises and reconstructs the semantic essence of a sample, liberated from the classic pursuit of reversing the sample to its original state. As a proof of concept, we conduct experimental simulations using a multimodal generative dialogue agent and evaluates the methodology under a variety of attack scenarios.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Game-Theoretic Analysis of Autonomous Cyber-Defence Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent rise in increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks raises the need for robust and resilient autonomous cyber-defence (ACD) agents. Given the variety of cyber-attack tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) employed, learning approaches that can return generalisable policies are desirable. Meanwhile, the assurance of ACD agents remains an open challenge. We address both challenges via an empirical game-theoretic analysis of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches for ACD using the principled double oracle (DO) algorithm. This algorithm relies on adversaries iteratively learning (approximate) best responses against each others' policies; a computationally expensive endeavour for autonomous cyber operations agents. In this work we introduce and evaluate a theoretically-sound, potential-based reward shaping approach to expedite this process. In addition, given the increasing number of open-source ACD-DRL approaches, we extend the DO formulation to allow for multiple response oracles (MRO), providing a framework for a holistic evaluation of ACD approaches.</description>

      <title>SHARPIE: A Modular Framework for Reinforcement Learning and Human-AI Interaction Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a general approach for modeling and training AI agents, including human-AI interaction scenarios. In this paper, we propose SHARPIE (Shared Human-AI Reinforcement Learning Platform for Interactive Experiments) to address the need for a generic framework to support experiments with RL agents and humans. Its modular design consists of a versatile wrapper for RL environments and algorithm libraries, a participant-facing web interface, logging utilities, deployment on popular cloud and participant recruitment platforms. It empowers researchers to study a wide variety of research questions related to the interaction between humans and RL agents, including those related to interactive reward specification and learning, learning from human feedback, action delegation, preference elicitation, user-modeling, and human-AI teaming. The platform is based on a generic interface for human-RL interactions that aims to standardize the field of study on RL in human contexts.</description>

      <title>Objective Metrics for Human-Subjects Evaluation in Explainable Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explanation is a fundamentally human process. Understanding the goal and audience of the explanation is vital, yet existing work on explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) routinely does not consult humans in their evaluations. Even when they do, they routinely resort to subjective metrics, such as confidence or understanding, that can only inform researchers of users' opinions, not their practical effectiveness for a given problem. This paper calls on researchers to use objective human metrics for explanation evaluations based on observable and actionable behaviour to build more reproducible, comparable, and epistemically grounded research. To this end, we curate, describe, and compare several objective evaluation methodologies for applying explanations to debugging agent behaviour and supporting human-agent teaming, illustrating our proposed methods using a novel grid-based environment. We discuss how subjective and objective metrics complement each other to provide holistic validation and how future work needs to utilise standardised benchmarks for testing to enable greater comparisons between research.</description>

      <title>Jackpot! Alignment as a Maximal Lottery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), the standard for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values, is known to fail to satisfy properties that are intuitively desirable, such as respecting the preferences of the majority \cite{ge2024axioms}. To overcome these issues, we propose the use of a probabilistic Social Choice rule called \emph{maximal lotteries} as a replacement for RLHF. We show that a family of alignment techniques, namely Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF) \cite{munos2023nash} and variants, approximate maximal lottery outcomes and thus inherit its beneficial properties.
  We confirm experimentally that our proposed methodology handles situations that arise when working with preferences more robustly than standard RLHF, including supporting the preferences of the majority, providing principled ways of handling non-transitivities in the preference data, and robustness to irrelevant alternatives. This results in systems that better incorporate human values and respect human intentions.</description>

      <title>Concept-Based Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Metrics and Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept-based explanation methods, such as concept bottleneck models (CBMs), aim to improve the interpretability of machine learning models by linking their decisions to human-understandable concepts, under the critical assumption that such concepts can be accurately attributed to the network's feature space. However, this foundational assumption has not been rigorously validated, mainly because the field lacks standardised metrics and benchmarks to assess the existence and spatial alignment of such concepts. To address this, we propose three metrics: the concept global importance metric, the concept existence metric, and the concept location metric, including a technique for visualising concept activations, i.e., concept activation mapping. We benchmark post-hoc CBMs to illustrate their capabilities and challenges. Through qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that, in many cases, even the most important concepts determined by post-hoc CBMs are not present in input images; moreover, when they are present, their saliency maps fail to align with the expected regions by either activating across an entire object or misidentifying relevant concept-specific regions. We analyse the root causes of these limitations, such as the natural correlation of concepts. Our findings underscore the need for more careful application of concept-based explanation techniques especially in settings where spatial interpretability is critical.</description>

      <title>Synthetic User Behavior Sequence Generation with Large Language Models for Smart Homes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, as smart home systems have become more widespread, security concerns within these environments have become a growing threat. Currently, most smart home security solutions, such as anomaly detection and behavior prediction models, are trained using fixed datasets that are precollected. However, the process of dataset collection is time-consuming and lacks the flexibility needed to adapt to the constantly evolving smart home environment. Additionally, the collection of personal data raises significant privacy concerns for users. Lately, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for a wide range of tasks across diverse application domains, thanks to their strong capabilities in natural language processing, reasoning, and problem-solving. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based synthetic dataset generation IoTGen framework to enhance the generalization of downstream smart home intelligent models. By generating new synthetic datasets that reflect changes in the environment, smart home intelligent models can be retrained to overcome the limitations of fixed and outdated data, allowing them to better align with the dynamic nature of real-world home environments. Specifically, we first propose a Structure Pattern Perception Compression (SPPC) method tailored for IoT behavior data, which preserves the most informative content in the data while significantly reducing token consumption. Then, we propose a systematic approach to create prompts and implement data generation to automatically generate IoT synthetic data with normative and reasonable properties, assisting task models in adaptive training to improve generalization and real-world performance.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have created new opportunities to enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks by leveraging test-time computation. However, conventional approaches such as repeated sampling with majority voting or reward model scoring, often face diminishing returns as test-time compute scales, in addition to requiring costly task-specific reward model training. In this paper, we present Self-Enhanced Test-Time Scaling (SETS), a novel method that leverages the self-verification and self-correction capabilities of recent advanced LLMs to overcome these limitations. SETS integrates sampling, self-verification, and self-correction into a unified framework, enabling efficient and scalable test-time computation for improved capabilities at complex tasks. Through extensive experiments on challenging planning and reasoning benchmarks, compared to the alternatives, we demonstrate that SETS achieves significant performance improvements and more favorable test-time scaling laws.</description>

      <title>Ontological analysis of proactive life event services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Life event service is a direct digital public service provided jointly by several governmental institutions so that a person can fulfill all the obligations and use all the rights that arise due to a particular event or situation in personal life. Life event service consolidates several public services related to the same life event into one service for the service consumer. This paper presents an ontological analysis of life event services, which is based on the works by Guarino, Guizzardi, Nardi, Wagner, and others. The purpose of the ontological analysis is to understand the meanings of life event, proactive public service based on life event, and other related notions. This kind of ontological analysis is crucial because for implementing the hardware and software architectures of e-government and digital public services, it is essential to agree upon the precise meanings of the underlying terms.</description>

      <title>MINDSTORES: Memory-Informed Neural Decision Synthesis for Task-Oriented Reinforcement in Embodied Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities as zero-shot planners for embodied agents, their inability to learn from experience and build persistent mental models limits their robustness in complex open-world environments like Minecraft. We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs Strategically Reveal, Conceal, and Infer Information? A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis in The Chameleon Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model-based (LLM-based) agents have become common in settings that include non-cooperative parties. In such settings, agents' decision-making needs to conceal information from their adversaries, reveal information to their cooperators, and infer information to identify the other agents' characteristics. To investigate whether LLMs have these information control and decision-making capabilities, we make LLM agents play the language-based hidden-identity game, The Chameleon. In the game, a group of non-chameleon agents who do not know each other aim to identify the chameleon agent without revealing a secret. The game requires the aforementioned information control capabilities both as a chameleon and a non-chameleon. The empirical results show that while non-chameleon LLM agents identify the chameleon, they fail to conceal the secret from the chameleon, and their winning probability is far from the levels of even trivial strategies. To formally explain this behavior, we give a theoretical analysis for a spectrum of strategies, from concealing to revealing, and provide bounds on the non-chameleons' winning probability. Based on the empirical results and theoretical analysis of different strategies, we deduce that LLM-based non-chameleon agents reveal excessive information to agents of unknown identities. Our results point to a weakness of contemporary LLMs, including GPT-4, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, in strategic interactions.</description>

      <title>Faster Configuration Performance Bug Testing with Neural Dual-level Prioritization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As software systems become more complex and configurable, more performance problems tend to arise from the configuration designs. This has caused some configuration options to unexpectedly degrade performance which deviates from their original expectations designed by the developers. Such discrepancies, namely configuration performance bugs (CPBugs), are devastating and can be deeply hidden in the source code. Yet, efficiently testing CPBugs is difficult, not only due to the test oracle is hard to set, but also because the configuration measurement is expensive and there are simply too many possible configurations to test. As such, existing testing tools suffer from lengthy runtime or have been ineffective in detecting CPBugs when the budget is limited, compounded by inaccurate test oracle. In this paper, we seek to achieve significantly faster CPBug testing by neurally prioritizing the testing at both the configuration option and value range levels with automated oracle estimation. Our proposed tool, dubbed NDP, is a general framework that works with different heuristic generators. The idea is to leverage two neural language models: one to estimate the CPBug types that serve as the oracle while, more vitally, the other to infer the probabilities of an option being CPBug-related, based on which the options and the value ranges to be searched can be prioritized. Experiments on several widely-used systems of different versions reveal that NDP can, in general, better predict CPBug type in 87% cases and find more CPBugs with up to 88.88x testing efficiency speedup over the state-of-the-art tools.</description>

      <title>Deeply Optimizing the SAT Solver for the IC3 Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IC3 algorithm, also known as PDR, is a SAT-based model checking algorithm that has significantly influenced the field in recent years due to its efficiency, scalability, and completeness. It utilizes SAT solvers to solve a series of SAT queries associated with relative induction. Based on our observations of the unique characteristics of SAT queries in IC3, this paper introduces GipSAT, a lightweight SAT solver specifically optimized for IC3. By observing that SAT queries do not necessarily require decisions on all variables, GipSAT calculates a subset of variables that need to be decided before each solving, while ensuring that the result remains unaffected. By observing that the overhead of binary heap operations in VSIDS is not negligible, GipSAT utilizes buckets instead of binary heap to achieve constant-time operations. GipSAT supports temporary clauses without the need to allocate a new activation variable before each solving, thus eliminating the need to reset solvers. The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates a significant performance improvement achieved by GipSAT. When compared to Minisat, GipSAT achieves an average speedup of 3.61 times in solving time.</description>

      <title>Review and Recommendations for using Artificial Intelligence in Intracoronary Optical Coherence Tomography Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies hold great promise for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) from intravascular optical coherent tomography (IVOCT) images. Numerous papers have been published describing AI-based models for different diagnostic tasks, yet it remains unclear which models have potential clinical utility and have been properly validated. This systematic review considered published literature between January 2015 and February 2023 describing AI-based diagnosis of CAD using IVOCT. Our search identified 5,576 studies, with 513 included after initial screening and 35 studies included in the final systematic review after quality screening. Our findings indicate that most of the identified models are not currently suitable for clinical use, primarily due to methodological flaws and underlying biases. To address these issues, we provide recommendations to improve model quality and research practices to enhance the development of clinically useful AI products.</description>

      <title>STAMP: Scalable Task And Model-agnostic Collaborative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perception is crucial for autonomous driving, but single-agent perception is often constrained by sensors' physical limitations, leading to degraded performance under severe occlusion, adverse weather conditions, and when detecting distant objects. Multi-agent collaborative perception offers a solution, yet challenges arise when integrating heterogeneous agents with varying model architectures. To address these challenges, we propose STAMP, a scalable task- and model-agnostic, collaborative perception pipeline for heterogeneous agents. STAMP utilizes lightweight adapter-reverter pairs to transform Bird's Eye View (BEV) features between agent-specific and shared protocol domains, enabling efficient feature sharing and fusion. This approach minimizes computational overhead, enhances scalability, and preserves model security. Experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate STAMP's comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art models with significantly reduced computational costs. As a first-of-its-kind task- and model-agnostic framework, STAMP aims to advance research in scalable and secure mobility systems towards Level 5 autonomy.

      <title>Membership Inference Attacks Against Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), built on pre-trained vision encoders and large language models (LLMs), have shown exceptional multi-modal understanding and dialog capabilities, positioning them as catalysts for the next technological revolution. However, while most VLM research focuses on enhancing multi-modal interaction, the risks of data misuse and leakage have been largely unexplored. This prompts the need for a comprehensive investigation of such risks in VLMs. In this paper, we conduct the first analysis of misuse and leakage detection in VLMs through the lens of membership inference attack (MIA). In specific, we focus on the instruction tuning data of VLMs, which is more likely to contain sensitive or unauthorized information. To address the limitation of existing MIA methods, we introduce a novel approach that infers membership based on a set of samples and their sensitivity to temperature, a unique parameter in VLMs. Based on this, we propose four membership inference methods, each tailored to different levels of background knowledge, ultimately arriving at the most challenging scenario. Our comprehensive evaluations show that these methods can accurately determine membership status, e.g., achieving an AUC greater than 0.8 targeting a small set consisting of only 5 samples on LLaVA.</description>

      <title>The TIP of the Iceberg: Revealing a Hidden Class of Task-In-Prompt Adversarial Attacks on LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel class of jailbreak adversarial attacks on LLMs, termed Task-in-Prompt (TIP) attacks. Our approach embeds sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., cipher decoding, riddles, code execution) into the model's prompt to indirectly generate prohibited inputs. To systematically assess the effectiveness of these attacks, we introduce the PHRYGE benchmark. We demonstrate that our techniques successfully circumvent safeguards in six state-of-the-art language models, including GPT-4o and LLaMA 3.2. Our findings highlight critical weaknesses in current LLM safety alignments and underscore the urgent need for more sophisticated defence strategies.

      <description>arXiv:2501.18628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Indiana Jones, an innovative approach to jailbreaking Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging inter-model dialogues and keyword-driven prompts. Through orchestrating interactions among three specialised LLMs, the method achieves near-perfect success rates in bypassing content safeguards in both white-box and black-box LLMs. The research exposes systemic vulnerabilities within contemporary models, particularly their susceptibility to producing harmful or unethical outputs when guided by ostensibly innocuous prompts framed in historical or contextual contexts. Experimental evaluations highlight the efficacy and adaptability of Indiana Jones, demonstrating its superiority over existing jailbreak methods. These findings emphasise the urgent need for enhanced ethical safeguards and robust security measures in the development of LLMs. Moreover, this work provides a critical foundation for future studies aimed at fortifying LLMs against adversarial exploitation while preserving their utility and flexibility.</description>

      <title>SafeRAG: Benchmarking Security in Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The indexing-retrieval-generation paradigm of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been highly successful in solving knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs). However, the incorporation of external and unverified knowledge increases the vulnerability of LLMs because attackers can perform attack tasks by manipulating knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark named SafeRAG designed to evaluate the RAG security. First, we classify attack tasks into silver noise, inter-context conflict, soft ad, and white Denial-of-Service. Next, we construct RAG security evaluation dataset (i.e., SafeRAG dataset) primarily manually for each task. We then utilize the SafeRAG dataset to simulate various attack scenarios that RAG may encounter. Experiments conducted on 14 representative RAG components demonstrate that RAG exhibits significant vulnerability to all attack tasks and even the most apparent attack task can easily bypass existing retrievers, filters, or advanced LLMs, resulting in the degradation of RAG service quality.

Abstract: We present a modular pipeline that automates the generation of stealthy jailbreak prompts derived from high-level content policies, enhancing LLM content moderation. First, we address query inefficiency and jailbreak strength by developing Graph of Attacks with Pruning (GAP), a method that utilizes strategies from prior jailbreaks, resulting in 92% attack success rate on GPT-3.5 using only 54% of the queries of the prior algorithm. Second, we address the cold-start issue by automatically generating seed prompts from the high-level policy using LLMs. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of these generated jailbreak prompts of improving content moderation by fine-tuning PromptGuard, a model trained to detect jailbreaks, increasing its accuracy on the Toxic-Chat dataset from 5.1% to 93.89%.</description>

      <title>DebiasPI: Inference-time Debiasing by Prompt Iteration of a Text-to-Image Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ethical intervention prompting has emerged as a tool to counter demographic biases of text-to-image generative AI models. Existing solutions either require to retrain the model or struggle to generate images that reflect desired distributions on gender and race. We propose an inference-time process called DebiasPI for Debiasing-by-Prompt-Iteration that provides prompt intervention by enabling the user to control the distributions of individuals' demographic attributes in image generation. DebiasPI keeps track of which attributes have been generated either by probing the internal state of the model or by using external attribute classifiers. Its control loop guides the text-to-image model to select not yet sufficiently represented attributes, With DebiasPI, we were able to create images with equal representations of race and gender that visualize challenging concepts of news headlines. We also experimented with the attributes age, body type, profession, and skin tone, and measured how attributes change when our intervention prompt targets the distribution of an unrelated attribute type. We found, for example, if the text-to-image model is asked to balance racial representation, gender representation improves but the skin tone becomes less diverse. Attempts to cover a wide range of skin colors with various intervention prompts showed that the model struggles to generate the palest skin tones. We conducted various ablation studies, in which we removed DebiasPI's attribute control, that reveal the model's propensity to generate young, male characters. It sometimes visualized career success by generating two-panel images with a pre-success dark-skinned person becoming light-skinned with success, or switching gender from pre-success female to post-success male, thus further motivating ethical intervention prompting with DebiasPI.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a mobile-based solution that enhances online shoe shopping through 3D modeling and Augmented Reality (AR), leveraging the efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting. Addressing the limitations of static 2D images, the framework generates realistic 3D shoe models from 2D images, achieving an average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 0.32, and enables immersive AR interactions via smartphones. A custom shoe segmentation dataset of 3120 images was created, with the best-performing segmentation model achieving an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.95. This paper demonstrates the potential of 3D modeling and AR to revolutionize online shopping by offering realistic virtual interactions, with applicability across broader fashion categories.</description>

      <title>Layered Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Multi-Agent LLM Systems: A Comprehensive Approach to Explainable Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to provide step-by-step rationales, improving performance on complex tasks. Despite its benefits, vanilla CoT often fails to fully verify intermediate inferences and can produce misleading explanations. In this work, we propose Layered Chain-of-Thought (Layered-CoT) Prompting, a novel framework that systematically segments the reasoning process into multiple layers, each subjected to external checks and optional user feedback. We expand on the key concepts, present three scenarios -- medical triage, financial risk assessment, and agile engineering -- and demonstrate how Layered-CoT surpasses vanilla CoT in terms of transparency, correctness, and user engagement. By integrating references from recent arXiv papers on interactive explainability, multi-agent frameworks, and agent-based collaboration, we illustrate how Layered-CoT paves the way for more reliable and grounded explanations in high-stakes domains.</description>

      <title>Fake News Detection After LLM Laundering: Measurement and Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With their advanced capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate highly convincing and contextually relevant fake news, which can contribute to disseminating misinformation. Though there is much research on fake news detection for human-written text, the field of detecting LLM-generated fake news is still under-explored. This research measures the efficacy of detectors in identifying LLM-paraphrased fake news, in particular, determining whether adding a paraphrase step in the detection pipeline helps or impedes detection. This study contributes: (1) Detectors struggle to detect LLM-paraphrased fake news more than human-written text, (2) We find which models excel at which tasks (evading detection, paraphrasing to evade detection, and paraphrasing for semantic similarity). (3) Via LIME explanations, we discovered a possible reason for detection failures: sentiment shift. (4) We discover a worrisome trend for paraphrase quality measurement: samples that exhibit sentiment shift despite a high BERTSCORE. (5) We provide a pair of datasets augmenting existing datasets with paraphrase outputs and scores. The dataset is available on GitHub</description>

      <title>Cogito, ergo sum: A Neurobiologically-Inspired Cognition-Memory-Growth System for Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models based Multi Agent Systems (MAS) have demonstrated promising performance for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of code generation tasks. However,most existing methods follow a conventional sequence of planning, coding, and debugging,which contradicts the growth-driven nature of human learning process. Additionally,the frequent information interaction between multiple agents inevitably involves high computational costs. In this paper,we propose Cogito,a neurobiologically inspired multi-agent framework to enhance the problem-solving capabilities in code generation tasks with lower cost. Specifically,Cogito adopts a reverse sequence: it first undergoes debugging, then coding,and finally planning. This approach mimics human learning and development,where knowledge is acquired progressively. Accordingly,a hippocampus-like memory module with different functions is designed to work with the pipeline to provide quick retrieval in similar tasks. Through this growth-based learning model,Cogito accumulates knowledge and cognitive skills at each stage,ultimately forming a Super Role an all capable agent to perform the code generation task. Extensive experiments against representative baselines demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of Cogito. The code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Cogito-0083.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Prompt Security and System Performance in Edge-Cloud LLM Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly facilitated human life, and prompt engineering has improved the efficiency of these models. However, recent years have witnessed a rise in prompt engineering-empowered attacks, leading to issues such as privacy leaks, increased latency, and system resource wastage. Though safety fine-tuning based methods with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are proposed to align the LLMs, existing security mechanisms fail to cope with fickle prompt attacks, highlighting the necessity of performing security detection on prompts. In this paper, we jointly consider prompt security, service latency, and system resource optimization in Edge-Cloud LLM (EC-LLM) systems under various prompt attacks. To enhance prompt security, a vector-database-enabled lightweight attack detector is proposed. We formalize the problem of joint prompt detection, latency, and resource optimization into a multi-stage dynamic Bayesian game model. The equilibrium strategy is determined by predicting the number of malicious tasks and updating beliefs at each stage through Bayesian updates. The proposed scheme is evaluated on a real implemented EC-LLM system, and the results demonstrate that our approach offers enhanced security, reduces the service latency for benign users, and decreases system resource consumption compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the Upsampling Layer in Hyperspectral Image Super Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has achieved significant success in single hyperspectral image super-resolution (SHSR); however, the high spectral dimensionality leads to a heavy computational burden, thus making it difficult to deploy in real-time scenarios. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel lightweight SHSR network, i.e., LKCA-Net, that incorporates channel attention to calibrate multi-scale channel features of hyperspectral images. Furthermore, we demonstrate, for the first time, that the low-rank property of the learnable upsampling layer is a key bottleneck in lightweight SHSR methods. To address this, we employ the low-rank approximation strategy to optimize the parameter redundancy of the learnable upsampling layer. Additionally, we introduce a knowledge distillation-based feature alignment technique to ensure the low-rank approximated network retains the same feature representation capacity as the original. We conducted extensive experiments on the Chikusei, Houston 2018, and Pavia Center datasets compared to some SOTAs. The results demonstrate that our method is competitive in performance while achieving speedups of several dozen to even hundreds of times compared to other well-performing SHSR methods.</description>

      <title>BARNN: A Bayesian Autoregressive and Recurrent Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive and recurrent networks have achieved remarkable progress across various fields, from weather forecasting to molecular generation and Large Language Models. Despite their strong predictive capabilities, these models lack a rigorous framework for addressing uncertainty, which is key in scientific applications such as PDE solving, molecular generation and Machine Learning Force Fields. To address this shortcoming we present BARNN: a variational Bayesian Autoregressive and Recurrent Neural Network. BARNNs aim to provide a principled way to turn any autoregressive or recurrent model into its Bayesian version. BARNN is based on the variational dropout method, allowing to apply it to large recurrent neural networks as well. We also introduce a temporal version of the "Variational Mixtures of Posteriors" prior (tVAMP-prior) to make Bayesian inference efficient and well-calibrated. Extensive experiments on PDE modelling and molecular generation demonstrate that BARNN not only achieves comparable or superior accuracy compared to existing methods, but also excels in uncertainty quantification and modelling long-range dependencies.</description>

      <title>Structure Development in List-Sorting Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how a one-layer attention-only transformer develops relevant structures while learning to sort lists of numbers. At the end of training, the model organizes its attention heads in two main modes that we refer to as vocabulary-splitting and copy-suppression. Both represent simpler modes than having multiple heads handle overlapping ranges of numbers. Interestingly, vocabulary-splitting is present regardless of whether we use weight decay, a common regularization technique thought to drive simplification, supporting the thesis that neural networks naturally prefer simpler solutions. We relate copy-suppression to a mechanism in GPT-2 and investigate its functional role in our model. Guided by insights from a developmental analysis of the model, we identify features in the training data that drive the model's final acquired solution. This provides a concrete example of how the training data shape the internal organization of transformers, paving the way for future studies that could help us better understand how LLMs develop their internal structures.</description>

      <title>The Pitfalls of "Security by Obscurity" And What They Mean for Transparent AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calls for transparency in AI systems are growing in number and urgency from diverse stakeholders ranging from regulators to researchers to users (with a comparative absence of companies developing AI). Notions of transparency for AI abound, each addressing distinct interests and concerns.
  In computer security, transparency is likewise regarded as a key concept. The security community has for decades pushed back against so-called security by obscurity -- the idea that hiding how a system works protects it from attack -- against significant pressure from industry and other stakeholders. Over the decades, in a community process that is imperfect and ongoing, security researchers and practitioners have gradually built up some norms and practices around how to balance transparency interests with possible negative side effects. This paper asks: What insights can the AI community take from the security community's experience with transparency?
  We identify three key themes in the security community's perspective on the benefits of transparency and their approach to balancing transparency against countervailing interests. For each, we investigate parallels and insights relevant to transparency in AI. We then provide a case study discussion on how transparency has shaped the research subfield of anonymization. Finally, shifting our focus from similarities to differences, we highlight key transparency issues where modern AI systems present challenges different from other kinds of security-critical systems, raising interesting open questions for the security and AI communities alike.</description>

      <title>High-Accuracy ECG Image Interpretation using Parameter-Efficient LoRA Fine-Tuning with Multimodal LLaMA 3.2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is a cornerstone of cardiac diagnostics. This paper explores a practical approach to enhance ECG image interpretation using the multimodal LLaMA 3.2 model. We used a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), specifically designed to boost the model's ability to understand ECG images and achieve better outcomes across a wide range of cardiac conditions. Our method is tailored for ECG analysis and leverages ECGInstruct, a large-scale instruction dataset with 1 Million samples. This dataset is a rich collection of synthesized ECG images, generated from raw ECG data from trusted open-source repositories like MIMIC-IV ECG and PTB-XL. Each ECG image in ECGInstruct comes with expert-written questions and detailed answers, covering diverse ECG interpretation scenarios, including complex cardiac conditions like Myocardial Infarction and Conduction Disturbances. Our fine-tuning approach efficiently adapts the LLaMA 3.2 model (built upon LLaMA 3) by integrating low-rank adaptation techniques, focusing on efficiency by updating only a small set of parameters, specifically ignoring the `lm_head` and `embed_tokens` layers. This paper details the model setup, our efficient fine-tuning method, and implementation specifics. We provide a thorough evaluation through extensive experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method across various ECG interpretation tasks. The results convincingly show that our parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning achieves excellent performance in ECG image interpretation, significantly outperforming baseline models and reaching accuracy comparable to or exceeding traditional CNN-based methods in identifying a wide range of cardiac abnormalities, including over 70 conditions from the PTB-XL dataset.</description>

      <title>Scaling Policy Gradient Quality-Diversity with Massive Parallelization via Behavioral Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quality-Diversity optimization comprises a family of evolutionary algorithms aimed at generating a collection of diverse and high-performing solutions. MAP-Elites (ME), a notable example, is used effectively in fields like evolutionary robotics. However, the reliance of ME on random mutations from Genetic Algorithms limits its ability to evolve high-dimensional solutions. Methods proposed to overcome this include using gradient-based operators like policy gradients or natural evolution strategies. While successful at scaling ME for neuroevolution, these methods often suffer from slow training speeds, or difficulties in scaling with massive parallelization due to high computational demands or reliance on centralized actor-critic training. In this work, we introduce a fast, sample-efficient ME based algorithm capable of scaling up with massive parallelization, significantly reducing runtimes without compromising performance. Our method, ASCII-ME, unlike existing policy gradient quality-diversity methods, does not rely on centralized actor-critic training. It performs behavioral variations based on time step performance metrics and maps these variations to solutions using policy gradients. Our experiments show that ASCII-ME can generate a diverse collection of high-performing deep neural network policies in less than 250 seconds on a single GPU. Additionally, it operates on average, five times faster than state-of-the-art algorithms while still maintaining competitive sample efficiency.</description>

      <title>Exploring Audio Editing Features as User-Centric Privacy Defenses Against Emotion Inference Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of speech-enabled technologies, including virtual assistants, video conferencing platforms, and wearable devices, has raised significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding the inference of sensitive emotional information from audio data. Existing privacy-preserving methods often compromise usability and security, limiting their adoption in practical scenarios. This paper introduces a novel, user-centric approach that leverages familiar audio editing techniques, specifically pitch and tempo manipulation, to protect emotional privacy without sacrificing usability. By analyzing popular audio editing applications on Android and iOS platforms, we identified these features as both widely available and usable. We rigorously evaluated their effectiveness against a threat model, considering adversarial attacks from diverse sources, including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and and reversibility testing. Our experiments, conducted on three distinct datasets, demonstrate that pitch and tempo manipulation effectively obfuscates emotional data. Additionally, we explore the design principles for lightweight, on-device implementation to ensure broad applicability across various devices and platforms.</description>

      <title>Integrating LMM Planners and 3D Skill Policies for Generalizable Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent advancements in visual reasoning capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs) and the semantic enrichment of 3D feature fields have expanded the horizons of robotic capabilities. These developments hold significant potential for bridging the gap between high-level reasoning from LMMs and low-level control policies utilizing 3D feature fields. In this work, we introduce LMM-3DP, a framework that can integrate LMM planners and 3D skill Policies. Our approach consists of three key perspectives: high-level planning, low-level control, and effective integration. For high-level planning, LMM-3DP supports dynamic scene understanding for environment disturbances, a critic agent with self-feedback, history policy memorization, and reattempts after failures. For low-level control, LMM-3DP utilizes a semantic-aware 3D feature field for accurate manipulation. In aligning high-level and low-level control for robot actions, language embeddings representing the high-level policy are jointly attended with the 3D feature field in the 3D transformer for seamless integration. We extensively evaluate our approach across multiple skills and long-horizon tasks in a real-world kitchen environment. Our results show a significant 1.45x success rate increase in low-level control and an approximate 1.5x improvement in high-level planning accuracy compared to LLM-based baselines. Demo videos and an overview of LMM-3DP are available at https://lmm-3dp-release.github.io.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph learning tasks require models to comprehend essential substructure patterns relevant to downstream tasks, such as triadic closures in social networks and benzene rings in molecular graphs. Due to the non-Euclidean nature of graphs, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) rely on message passing to iteratively aggregate information from local neighborhoods. Despite their empirical success, message passing struggles to identify fundamental substructures, such as triangles, limiting its expressiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Neural Graph Pattern Machine (GPM), a framework designed to learn directly from graph patterns. GPM efficiently extracts and encodes substructures while identifying the most relevant ones for downstream tasks. We also demonstrate that GPM offers superior expressivity and improved long-range information modeling compared to message passing. Empirical evaluations on node classification, link prediction, graph classification, and regression show the superiority of GPM over state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis reveals its desirable out-of-distribution robustness, scalability, and interpretability. We consider GPM to be a step toward going beyond message passing.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data Generation for Augmenting Small Samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small datasets are common in health research. However, the generalization performance of machine learning models is suboptimal when the training datasets are small. To address this, data augmentation is one solution. Augmentation increases sample size and is seen as a form of regularization that increases the diversity of small datasets, leading them to perform better on unseen data. We found that augmentation improves prognostic performance for datasets that: have fewer observations, with smaller baseline AUC, have higher cardinality categorical variables, and have more balanced outcome variables. No specific generative model consistently outperformed the others. We developed a decision support model that can be used to inform analysts if augmentation would be useful. For seven small application datasets, augmenting the existing data results in an increase in AUC between 4.31% (AUC from 0.71 to 0.75) and 43.23% (AUC from 0.51 to 0.73), with an average 15.55% relative improvement, demonstrating the nontrivial impact of augmentation on small datasets (p=0.0078). Augmentation AUC was higher than resampling only AUC (p=0.016). The diversity of augmented datasets was higher than the diversity of resampled datasets (p=0.046).</description>

      <title>Breaking the Fake News Barrier: Deep Learning Approaches in Bangla Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of digital stages has greatly compounded the dispersal of untrue data, dissolving certainty and judgment in society, especially among the Bengali-speaking community. Our ponder addresses this critical issue by presenting an interesting strategy that utilizes a profound learning innovation, particularly the Gated Repetitive Unit (GRU), to recognize fake news within the Bangla dialect. The strategy of our proposed work incorporates intensive information preprocessing, which includes lemmatization, tokenization, and tending to course awkward nature by oversampling. This comes about in a dataset containing 58,478 passages. We appreciate the creation of a demonstration based on GRU (Gated Repetitive Unit) that illustrates remarkable execution with a noteworthy precision rate of 94%. This ponder gives an intensive clarification of the methods included in planning the information, selecting the show, preparing it, and assessing its execution. The performance of the model is investigated by reliable metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. The commitment of the work incorporates making a huge fake news dataset in Bangla and a demonstration that has outperformed other Bangla fake news location models.</description>

      <title>Diversity By Design: Leveraging Distribution Matching for Offline Model-Based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of offline model-based optimization (MBO) is to propose new designs that maximize a reward function given only an offline dataset. However, an important desiderata is to also propose a diverse set of final candidates that capture many optimal and near-optimal design configurations. We propose Diversity in Adversarial Model-based Optimization (DynAMO) as a novel method to introduce design diversity as an explicit objective into any MBO problem. Our key insight is to formulate diversity as a distribution matching problem where the distribution of generated designs captures the inherent diversity contained within the offline dataset. Extensive experiments spanning multiple scientific domains show that DynAMO can be used with common optimization methods to significantly improve the diversity of proposed designs while still discovering high-quality candidates.</description>

      <title>Overestimation in LLM Evaluation: A Controlled Large-Scale Study on Data Contamination's Impact on Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data contamination -- the accidental consumption of evaluation examples within the pre-training data -- can undermine the validity of evaluation benchmarks. In this paper, we present a rigorous analysis of the effects of contamination on language models at 1B and 8B scales on the machine translation task. Starting from a carefully decontaminated train-test split, we systematically introduce contamination at various stages, scales, and data formats to isolate its effect and measure its impact on performance metrics. Our experiments reveal that contamination with both source and target substantially inflates BLEU scores, and this inflation is 2.5 times larger (up to 30 BLEU points) for 8B compared to 1B models. In contrast, source-only and target-only contamination generally produce smaller, less consistent over-estimations. Finally, we study how the temporal distribution and frequency of contaminated samples influence performance over-estimation across languages with varying degrees of data resources.</description>

      <title>OT-Transformer: A Continuous-time Transformer Architecture with Optimal Transport Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in numerous tasks. In this paper, we propose a continuous-time formulation of transformers. Specifically, we consider a dynamical system whose governing equation is parametrized by transformer blocks. We leverage optimal transport theory to regularize the training problem, which enhances stability in training and improves generalization of the resulting model. Moreover, we demonstrate in theory that this regularization is necessary as it promotes uniqueness and regularity of solutions. Our model is flexible in that almost any existing transformer architectures can be adopted to construct the dynamical system with only slight modifications to the existing code. We perform extensive numerical experiments on tasks motivated by natural language processing, image classification, and point cloud classification. Our experimental results show that the proposed method improves the performance of its discrete counterpart and outperforms relevant comparing models.</description>

      <title>Survey and Improvement Strategies for Gene Prioritization with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare diseases are challenging to diagnose due to limited patient data and genetic diversity. Despite advances in variant prioritization, many cases remain undiagnosed. While large language models (LLMs) have performed well in medical exams, their effectiveness in diagnosing rare genetic diseases has not been assessed. To identify causal genes, we benchmarked various LLMs for gene prioritization. Using multi-agent and Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) classification, we categorized patients based on phenotypes and solvability levels. As gene set size increased, LLM performance deteriorated, so we used a divide-and-conquer strategy to break the task into smaller subsets. At baseline, GPT-4 outperformed other LLMs, achieving near 30% accuracy in ranking causal genes correctly. The multi-agent and HPO approaches helped distinguish confidently solved cases from challenging ones, highlighting the importance of known gene-phenotype associations and phenotype specificity. We found that cases with specific phenotypes or clear associations were more accurately solved. However, we observed biases toward well-studied genes and input order sensitivity, which hindered gene prioritization. Our divide-and-conquer strategy improved accuracy by overcoming these biases. By utilizing HPO classification, novel multi-agent techniques, and our LLM strategy, we improved causal gene identification accuracy compared to our baseline evaluation. This approach streamlines rare disease diagnosis, facilitates reanalysis of unsolved cases, and accelerates gene discovery, supporting the development of targeted diagnostics and therapies.</description>

      <title>Compositional Generalization Requires More Than Disentangled Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Composition-the ability to generate myriad variations from finite means-is believed to underlie powerful generalization. However, compositional generalization remains a key challenge for deep learning. A widely held assumption is that learning disentangled (factorized) representations naturally supports this kind of extrapolation. Yet, empirical results are mixed, with many generative models failing to recognize and compose factors to generate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. In this work, we investigate a controlled 2D Gaussian "bump" generation task, demonstrating that standard generative architectures fail in OOD regions when training with partial data, even when supplied with fully disentangled $(x, y)$ coordinates, re-entangling them through subsequent layers. By examining the model's learned kernels and manifold geometry, we show that this failure reflects a "memorization" strategy for generation through the superposition of training data rather than by combining the true factorized features. We show that models forced-through architectural modifications with regularization or curated training data-to create disentangled representations in the full-dimensional representational (pixel) space can be highly data-efficient and effective at learning to compose in OOD regions. These findings underscore that bottlenecks with factorized/disentangled representations in an abstract representation are insufficient: the model must actively maintain or induce factorization directly in the representational space in order to achieve robust compositional generalization.</description>

      <title>Every Image Listens, Every Image Dances: Music-Driven Image Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image animation has become a promising area in multimodal research, with a focus on generating videos from reference images. While prior work has largely emphasized generic video generation guided by text, music-driven dance video generation remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce MuseDance, an innovative end-to-end model that animates reference images using both music and text inputs. This dual input enables MuseDance to generate personalized videos that follow text descriptions and synchronize character movements with the music. Unlike existing approaches, MuseDance eliminates the need for complex motion guidance inputs, such as pose or depth sequences, making flexible and creative video generation accessible to users of all expertise levels. To advance research in this field, we present a new multimodal dataset comprising 2,904 dance videos with corresponding background music and text descriptions. Our approach leverages diffusion-based methods to achieve robust generalization, precise control, and temporal consistency, setting a new baseline for the music-driven image animation task.</description>

      <title>An Adversarial Approach to Register Extreme Resolution Tissue Cleared 3D Brain Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a generative patch based 3D image registration model that can register very high resolution images obtained from a biochemical process name tissue clearing. Tissue clearing process removes lipids and fats from the tissue and make the tissue transparent. When cleared tissues are imaged with Light-sheet fluorescent microscopy, the resulting images give a clear window to the cellular activities and dynamics inside the tissue.Thus the images obtained are very rich with cellular information and hence their resolution is extremely high (eg .2560x2160x676). Analyzing images with such high resolution is a difficult task for any image analysis pipeline.Image registration is a common step in image analysis pipeline when comparison between images are required. Traditional image registration methods fail to register images with such extant. In this paper we addressed this very high resolution image registration issue by proposing a patch-based generative network named InvGAN. Our proposed network can register very high resolution tissue cleared images. The tissue cleared dataset used in this paper are obtained from a tissue clearing protocol named CUBIC. We compared our method both with traditional and deep-learning based registration methods.Two different versions of CUBIC dataset are used, representing two different resolutions 25% and 100% respectively. Experiments on two different resolutions clearly show the impact of resolution on the registration quality. At 25% resolution, our method achieves comparable registration accuracy with very short time (7 minutes approximately). At 100% resolution, most of the traditional registration methods fail except Elastix registration tool.Elastix takes 28 hours to register where proposed InvGAN takes only 10 minutes.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Common-Sense Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While systems designed for solving planning tasks vastly outperform Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain, they usually discard the rich semantic information embedded within task descriptions. In contrast, LLMs possess parametrised knowledge across a wide range of topics, enabling them to leverage the natural language descriptions of planning tasks in their solutions. However, current research in this direction faces challenges in generating correct and executable plans. Furthermore, these approaches depend on the LLM to output solutions in an intermediate language, which must be translated into the representation language of the planning task. We introduce a novel planning method, which leverages the parametrised knowledge of LLMs by using their output as a heuristic for Hill-Climbing Search. This approach is further enhanced by prompting the LLM to generate a solution estimate to guide the search. Our method outperforms the task success rate of similar systems within a common household environment by 22 percentage points, with consistently executable plans. All actions are encoded in their original representation, demonstrating that strong results can be achieved without an intermediate language, thus eliminating the need for a translation step.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Cascade Feature-Level Spatiotemporal Fusion Strategy for Anomaly Detection in CAN Bus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles represent a revolutionary advancement driven by the integration of artificial intelligence within intelligent transportation systems. However, they remain vulnerable due to the absence of robust security mechanisms in the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. In order to mitigate the security issue, many machine learning models and strategies have been proposed, which primarily focus on a subset of dominant patterns of anomalies and lack rigorous evaluation in terms of reliability and robustness. Therefore, to address the limitations of previous works and mitigate the security vulnerability in CAN bus, the current study develops a model based on the intrinsic nature of the problem to cover all dominant patterns of anomalies. To achieve this, a cascade feature-level fusion strategy optimized by a two-parameter genetic algorithm is proposed to combine temporal and spatial information. Subsequently, the model is evaluated using a paired t-test to ensure reliability and robustness. Finally, a comprehensive comparative analysis conducted on two widely used datasets advocates that the proposed model outperforms other models and achieves superior accuracy and F1-score, demonstrating the best performance among all models presented to date.</description>

      <title>Pitfalls of defacing whole-head MRI: re-identification risk with diffusion models and compromised research potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defacing is often applied to head magnetic resonance image (MRI) datasets prior to public release to address privacy concerns. The alteration of facial and nearby voxels has provoked discussions about the true capability of these techniques to ensure privacy as well as their impact on downstream tasks. With advancements in deep generative models, the extent to which defacing can protect privacy is uncertain. Additionally, while the altered voxels are known to contain valuable anatomical information, their potential to support research beyond the anatomical regions directly affected by defacing remains uncertain. To evaluate these considerations, we develop a refacing pipeline that recovers faces in defaced head MRIs using cascaded diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs). The DPMs are trained on images from 180 subjects and tested on images from 484 unseen subjects, 469 of whom are from a different dataset. To assess whether the altered voxels in defacing contain universally useful information, we also predict computed tomography (CT)-derived skeletal muscle radiodensity from facial voxels in both defaced and original MRIs. The results show that DPMs can generate high-fidelity faces that resemble the original faces from defaced images, with surface distances to the original faces significantly smaller than those of a population average face (p &lt; 0.05). This performance also generalizes well to previously unseen datasets. For skeletal muscle radiodensity predictions, using defaced images results in significantly weaker Spearman's rank correlation coefficients compared to using original images (p &lt; 10-4). For shin muscle, the correlation is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) when using original images but not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05) when any defacing method is applied, suggesting that defacing might not only fail to protect privacy but also eliminate valuable information.</description>

      <title>Constitutional Classifiers: Defending against Universal Jailbreaks across Thousands of Hours of Red Teaming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to universal jailbreaks-prompting strategies that systematically bypass model safeguards and enable users to carry out harmful processes that require many model interactions, like manufacturing illegal substances at scale. To defend against these attacks, we introduce Constitutional Classifiers: safeguards trained on synthetic data, generated by prompting LLMs with natural language rules (i.e., a constitution) specifying permitted and restricted content. In over 3,000 estimated hours of red teaming, no red teamer found a universal jailbreak that could extract information from an early classifier-guarded LLM at a similar level of detail to an unguarded model across most target queries. On automated evaluations, enhanced classifiers demonstrated robust defense against held-out domain-specific jailbreaks. These classifiers also maintain deployment viability, with an absolute 0.38% increase in production-traffic refusals and a 23.7% inference overhead. Our work demonstrates that defending against universal jailbreaks while maintaining practical deployment viability is tractable.</description>

      <title>BRiTE: Bootstrapping Reinforced Thinking Process to Enhance Language Model Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, yet generating reliable reasoning processes remains a significant challenge. We present a unified probabilistic framework that formalizes LLM reasoning through a novel graphical model incorporating latent thinking processes and evaluation signals. Within this framework, we introduce the Bootstrapping Reinforced Thinking Process (BRiTE) algorithm, which works in two steps. First, it generates high-quality rationales by approximating the optimal thinking process through reinforcement learning, using a novel reward shaping mechanism. Second, it enhances the base LLM by maximizing the joint probability of rationale generation with respect to the model's parameters. Theoretically, we demonstrate BRiTE's convergence at a rate of $1/T$ with $T$ representing the number of iterations. Empirical evaluations on math and coding benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance across different base models without requiring human-annotated thinking processes. In addition, BRiTE demonstrates superior performance compared to existing algorithms that bootstrap thinking processes use alternative methods such as rejection sampling, and can even match or exceed the results achieved through supervised fine-tuning with human-annotated data.</description>

      <title>REG: Rectified Gradient Guidance for Conditional Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Guidance techniques are simple yet effective for improving conditional generation in diffusion models. Albeit their empirical success, the practical implementation of guidance diverges significantly from its theoretical motivation. In this paper, we reconcile this discrepancy by replacing the scaled marginal distribution target, which we prove theoretically invalid, with a valid scaled joint distribution objective. Additionally, we show that the established guidance implementations are approximations to the intractable optimal solution under no future foresight constraint. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose rectified gradient guidance (REG), a versatile enhancement designed to boost the performance of existing guidance methods. Experiments on 1D and 2D demonstrate that REG provides a better approximation to the optimal solution than prior guidance techniques, validating the proposed theoretical framework. Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image generation tasks show that incorporating REG consistently improves FID and Inception/CLIP scores across various settings compared to its absence.</description>

      <title>UP-VLA: A Unified Understanding and Prediction Model for Embodied Agent</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have leveraged pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to improve the generalization capabilities. VLMs, typically pre-trained on vision-language understanding tasks, provide rich semantic knowledge and reasoning abilities. However, prior research has shown that VLMs often focus on high-level semantic content and neglect low-level features, limiting their ability to capture detailed spatial information and understand physical dynamics. These aspects, which are crucial for embodied control tasks, remain underexplored in existing pre-training paradigms. In this paper, we investigate the training paradigm for VLAs, and introduce \textbf{UP-VLA}, a \textbf{U}nified VLA model training with both multi-modal \textbf{U}nderstanding and future \textbf{P}rediction objectives, enhancing both high-level semantic comprehension and low-level spatial understanding. Experimental results show that UP-VLA achieves a 33% improvement on the Calvin ABC-D benchmark compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. Additionally, UP-VLA demonstrates improved success rates in real-world manipulation tasks, particularly those requiring precise spatial information.</description>

      <title>Building Bridges, Not Walls -- Advancing Interpretability by Unifying Feature, Data, and Model Component Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of AI systems has made understanding their behavior a critical challenge. Numerous methods have been developed to attribute model behavior to three key aspects: input features, training data, and internal model components. However, these attribution methods are studied and applied rather independently, resulting in a fragmented landscape of approaches and terminology. This position paper argues that feature, data, and component attribution methods share fundamental similarities, and bridging them can benefit interpretability research. We conduct a detailed analysis of successful methods across three domains and present a unified view to demonstrate that these seemingly distinct methods employ similar approaches, such as perturbations, gradients, and linear approximations, differing primarily in their perspectives rather than core techniques. Our unified perspective enhances understanding of existing attribution methods, identifies shared concepts and challenges, makes this field more accessible to newcomers, and highlights new directions not only for attribution and interpretability but also for broader AI research, including model editing, steering, and regulation.</description>

      <title>Lightspeed Geometric Dataset Distance via Sliced Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce sliced optimal transport dataset distance (s-OTDD), a model-agnostic, embedding-agnostic approach for dataset comparison that requires no training, is robust to variations in the number of classes, and can handle disjoint label sets. The core innovation is Moment Transform Projection (MTP), which maps a label, represented as a distribution over features, to a real number. Using MTP, we derive a data point projection that transforms datasets into one-dimensional distributions. The s-OTDD is defined as the expected Wasserstein distance between the projected distributions, with respect to random projection parameters. Leveraging the closed form solution of one-dimensional optimal transport, s-OTDD achieves (near-)linear computational complexity in the number of data points and feature dimensions and is independent of the number of classes. With its geometrically meaningful projection, s-OTDD strongly correlates with the optimal transport dataset distance while being more efficient than existing dataset discrepancy measures. Moreover, it correlates well with the performance gap in transfer learning and classification accuracy in data augmentation.</description>

      <title>Deepfake Detection of Singing Voices With Whisper Encodings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deepfake generation of singing vocals is a concerning issue for artists in the music industry. In this work, we propose a singing voice deepfake detection (SVDD) system, which uses noise-variant encodings of open-AI's Whisper model. As counter-intuitive as it may sound, even though the Whisper model is known to be noise-robust, the encodings are rich in non-speech information, and are noise-variant. This leads us to evaluate Whisper encodings as feature representations for the SVDD task. Therefore, in this work, the SVDD task is performed on vocals and mixtures, and the performance is evaluated in \%EER over varying Whisper model sizes and two classifiers- CNN and ResNet34, under different testing conditions.</description>

      <title>KBQA-o1: Agentic Knowledge Base Question Answering with Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural language questions with a large-scale structured knowledge base (KB). Despite advancements with large language models (LLMs), KBQA still faces challenges in weak KB awareness, imbalance between effectiveness and efficiency, and high reliance on annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose KBQA-o1, a novel agentic KBQA method with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It introduces a ReAct-based agent process for stepwise logical form generation with KB environment exploration. Moreover, it employs MCTS, a heuristic search method driven by policy and reward models, to balance agentic exploration's performance and search space. With heuristic exploration, KBQA-o1 generates high-quality annotations for further improvement by incremental fine-tuning. Experimental results show that KBQA-o1 outperforms previous low-resource KBQA methods with limited annotated data, boosting Llama-3.1-8B model's GrailQA F1 performance to 78.5% compared to 48.5% of the previous sota method with GPT-3.5-turbo.</description>

      <title>Fantastic Targets for Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models and Where To Find Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concept erasure has emerged as a promising technique for mitigating the risk of harmful content generation in diffusion models by selectively unlearning undesirable concepts. The common principle of previous works to remove a specific concept is to map it to a fixed generic concept, such as a neutral concept or just an empty text prompt. In this paper, we demonstrate that this fixed-target strategy is suboptimal, as it fails to account for the impact of erasing one concept on the others. To address this limitation, we model the concept space as a graph and empirically analyze the effects of erasing one concept on the remaining concepts. Our analysis uncovers intriguing geometric properties of the concept space, where the influence of erasing a concept is confined to a local region. Building on this insight, we propose the Adaptive Guided Erasure (AGE) method, which \emph{dynamically} selects optimal target concepts tailored to each undesirable concept, minimizing unintended side effects. Experimental results show that AGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art erasure methods on preserving unrelated concepts while maintaining effective erasure performance. Our code is published at {https://github.com/tuananhbui89/Adaptive-Guided-Erasure}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a deep learning based robot intelligent model that renders robots learn and reason for complex tasks. First, by constructing a network of environmental factor matrix to stimulate the learning process of the robot intelligent model, the model parameters must be subjected to coarse &amp; fine tuning to optimize the loss function for minimizing the loss score, meanwhile robot intelligent model can fuse all previously known concepts together to represent things never experienced before, which need robot intelligent model can be generalized extensively. Secondly, in order to progressively develop a robot intelligent model with primary consciousness, every robot must be subjected to at least 1~3 years of special school for training anthropomorphic behaviour patterns to understand and process complex environmental information and make rational decisions. This work explores and delivers the potential application of deep learning-based quasi-consciousness training in the field of robot intelligent model.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Neural Function Approximation: The XNet Outperforming KAN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: XNet is a single-layer neural network architecture that leverages Cauchy integral-based activation functions for high-order function approximation. Through theoretical analysis, we show that the Cauchy activation functions used in XNet can achieve arbitrary-order polynomial convergence, fundamentally outperforming traditional MLPs and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) that rely on increased depth or B-spline activations. Our extensive experiments on function approximation, PDE solving, and reinforcement learning demonstrate XNet's superior performance - reducing approximation error by up to 50000 times and accelerating training by up to 10 times compared to existing approaches. These results establish XNet as a highly efficient architecture for both scientific computing and AI applications.</description>

      <title>GPO-VAE: Modeling Explainable Gene Perturbation Responses utilizing GRN-Aligned Parameter Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivation: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations is essential for understanding biological systems and developing targeted therapeutic strategies. While variational autoencoders (VAEs) have shown promise in modeling perturbation responses, their limited explainability poses a significant challenge, as the learned features often lack clear biological meaning. Nevertheless, model explainability is one of the most important aspects in the realm of biological AI. One of the most effective ways to achieve explainability is incorporating the concept of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in designing deep learning models such as VAEs. GRNs elicit the underlying causal relationships between genes and are capable of explaining the transcriptional responses caused by genetic perturbation treatments. Results: We propose GPO-VAE, an explainable VAE enhanced by GRN-aligned Parameter Optimization that explicitly models gene regulatory networks in the latent space. Our key approach is to optimize the learnable parameters related to latent perturbation effects towards GRN-aligned explainability. Experimental results on perturbation prediction show our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting transcriptional responses across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, additional results on evaluating the GRN inference task reveal our model's ability to generate meaningful GRNs compared to other methods. According to qualitative analysis, GPO-VAE posseses the ability to construct biologically explainable GRNs that align with experimentally validated regulatory pathways. GPO-VAE is available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/GPO-VAE</description>

      <title>Symmetric Pruning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Popular post-training pruning methods such as Wanda and RIA are known for their simple, yet effective, designs that have shown exceptional empirical performance. Wanda optimizes performance through calibrated activations during pruning, while RIA emphasizes the relative, rather than absolute, importance of weight elements. Despite their practical success, a thorough theoretical foundation explaining these outcomes has been lacking. This paper introduces new theoretical insights that redefine the standard minimization objective for pruning, offering a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to their success. Our study extends beyond these insights by proposing complementary strategies that consider both input activations and weight significance. We validate these approaches through rigorous experiments, demonstrating substantial enhancements over existing methods. Furthermore, we introduce a novel training-free fine-tuning approach $R^2$-DSnoT that incorporates relative weight importance and a regularized decision boundary within a dynamic pruning-and-growing framework, significantly outperforming strong baselines and establishing a new state of the art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in learning-based monocular positioning by proposing VKFPos, a novel approach that integrates Absolute Pose Regression (APR) and Relative Pose Regression (RPR) via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) within a variational Bayesian inference framework. Our method shows that the essential posterior probability of the monocular positioning problem can be decomposed into APR and RPR components. This decomposition is embedded in the deep learning model by predicting covariances in both APR and RPR branches, allowing them to account for associated uncertainties. These covariances enhance the loss functions and facilitate EKF integration. Experimental evaluations on both indoor and outdoor datasets show that the single-shot APR branch achieves accuracy on par with state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, for temporal positioning, where consecutive images allow for RPR and EKF integration, VKFPos outperforms temporal APR and model-based integration methods, achieving superior accuracy.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Attacks on AI-Generated Text Detection Models: A Token Probability-Based Approach Using Embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, text generation tools utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) have occasionally been misused across various domains, such as generating student reports or creative writings. This issue prompts plagiarism detection services to enhance their capabilities in identifying AI-generated content. Adversarial attacks are often used to test the robustness of AI-text generated detectors. This work proposes a novel textual adversarial attack on the detection models such as Fast-DetectGPT. The method employs embedding models for data perturbation, aiming at reconstructing the AI generated texts to reduce the likelihood of detection of the true origin of the texts. Specifically, we employ different embedding techniques, including the Tsetlin Machine (TM), an interpretable approach in machine learning for this purpose. By combining synonyms and embedding similarity vectors, we demonstrates the state-of-the-art reduction in detection scores against Fast-DetectGPT. Particularly, in the XSum dataset, the detection score decreased from 0.4431 to 0.2744 AUROC, and in the SQuAD dataset, it dropped from 0.5068 to 0.3532 AUROC.</description>

      <title>Virtual airways heatmaps to optimize point of entry location in lung biopsy planning systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: We present a virtual model to optimize point of entry (POE) in lung biopsy planning systems. Our model allows to compute the quality of a biopsy sample taken from potential POE, taking into account the margin of error that arises from discrepancies between the orientation in the planning simulation and the actual orientation during the operation. Additionally, the study examines the impact of the characteristics of the lesion. Methods: The quality of the biopsy is given by a heatmap projected onto the skeleton of a patient-specific model of airways. The skeleton provides a 3D representation of airways structure, while the heatmap intensity represents the potential amount of tissue that it could be extracted from each POE. This amount of tissue is determined by the intersection of the lesion with a cone that represents the uncertainty area in the introduction of biopsy instruments. The cone, lesion, and skeleton are modelled as graphical objects that define a 3D scene of the intervention. Results: We have simulated different settings of the intervention scene from a single anatomy extracted from a CT scan and two lesions with regular and irregular shapes. The different scenarios are simulated by systematic rotation of each lesion placed at different distances from airways. Analysis of the heatmaps for the different settings show a strong impact of lesion orientation for irregular shape and the distance for both shapes. Conclusion: The proposed heatmaps help to visually assess the optimal POE and identify whether multiple optimal POEs exist in different zones of the bronchi. They also allow us to model the maximum allowable error in navigation systems and study which variables have the greatest influence on the success of the operation. Additionally, they help determine at what point this influence could potentially jeopardize the operation.</description>

      <title>Swarm-Gen: Fast Generation of Diverse Feasible Swarm Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordination behavior in robot swarms is inherently multi-modal in nature. That is, there are numerous ways in which a swarm of robots can avoid inter-agent collisions and reach their respective goals. However, the problem of generating diverse and feasible swarm behaviors in a scalable manner remains largely unaddressed. In this paper, we fill this gap by combining generative models with a safety-filter (SF). Specifically, we sample diverse trajectories from a learned generative model which is subsequently projected onto the feasible set using the SF. We experiment with two choices for generative models, namely: Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) and Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE). We highlight the trade-offs these two models provide in terms of computation time and trajectory diversity. We develop a custom solver for our SF and equip it with a neural network that predicts context-specific initialization. Thecinitialization network is trained in a self-supervised manner, taking advantage of the differentiability of the SF solver. We provide two sets of empirical results. First, we demonstrate that we can generate a large set of multi-modal, feasible trajectories, simulating diverse swarm behaviors, within a few tens of milliseconds. Second, we show that our initialization network provides faster convergence of our SF solver vis-a-vis other alternative heuristics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To be considered reliable, a model must be calibrated so that its confidence in each decision closely reflects its true outcome. In this blogpost we'll take a look at the most commonly used definition for calibration and then dive into a frequently used evaluation measure for model calibration. We'll then cover some of the drawbacks of this measure and how these surfaced the need for additional notions of calibration, which require their own new evaluation measures. This post is not intended to be an in-depth dissection of all works on calibration, nor does it focus on how to calibrate models. Instead, it is meant to provide a gentle introduction to the different notions and their evaluation measures as well as to re-highlight some issues with a measure that is still widely used to evaluate calibration.</description>

      <title>Towards Physiologically Sensible Predictions via the Rule-based Reinforcement Learning Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper adds to the growing literature of reinforcement learning (RL) for healthcare by proposing a novel paradigm: augmenting any predictor with Rule-based RL Layer (RRLL) that corrects the model's physiologically impossible predictions. Specifically, RRLL takes as input states predicted labels and outputs corrected labels as actions. The reward of the state-action pair is evaluated by a set of general rules. RRLL is efficient, general and lightweight: it does not require heavy expert knowledge like prior work but only a set of impossible transitions. This set is much smaller than all possible transitions; yet it can effectively reduce physiologically impossible mistakes made by the state-of-the-art predictor models. We verify the utility of RRLL on a variety of important healthcare classification problems and observe significant improvements using the same setup, with only the domain-specific set of impossibility changed. In-depth analysis shows that RRLL indeed improves accuracy by effectively reducing the presence of physiologically impossible predictions.</description>

      <title>Enabling Autonomic Microservice Management through Self-Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern software systems necessitates robust autonomic self-management capabilities. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in this domain, they often face challenges in adapting their general knowledge to specific service contexts. To address this limitation, we propose ServiceOdyssey, a self-learning agent system that autonomously manages microservices without requiring prior knowledge of service-specific configurations. By leveraging curriculum learning principles and iterative exploration, ServiceOdyssey progressively develops a deep understanding of operational environments, reducing dependence on human input or static documentation. A prototype built with the Sock Shop microservice demonstrates the potential of this approach for autonomic microservice management.</description>

      <title>BEAT: Balanced Frequency Adaptive Tuning for Long-Term Time-Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-series forecasting is crucial for numerous real-world applications including weather prediction and financial market modeling. While temporal-domain methods remain prevalent, frequency-domain approaches can effectively capture multi-scale periodic patterns, reduce sequence dependencies, and naturally denoise signals. However, existing approaches typically train model components for all frequencies under a unified training objective, often leading to mismatched learning speeds: high-frequency components converge faster and risk overfitting, while low-frequency components underfit due to insufficient training time. To deal with this challenge, we propose BEAT (Balanced frEquency Adaptive Tuning), a novel framework that dynamically monitors the training status for each frequency and adaptively adjusts their gradient updates. By recognizing convergence, overfitting, or underfitting for each frequency, BEAT dynamically reallocates learning priorities, moderating gradients for rapid learners and increasing those for slower ones, alleviating the tension between competing objectives across frequencies and synchronizing the overall learning process. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that BEAT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Improving vision-language alignment with graph spiking hybrid Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To bridge the semantic gap between vision and language (VL), it is necessary to develop a good alignment strategy, which includes handling semantic diversity, abstract representation of visual information, and generalization ability of models. Recent works use detector-based bounding boxes or patches with regular partitions to represent visual semantics. While current paradigms have made strides, they are still insufficient for fully capturing the nuanced contextual relations among various objects. This paper proposes a comprehensive visual semantic representation module, necessitating the utilization of panoptic segmentation to generate coherent fine-grained semantic features. Furthermore, we propose a novel Graph Spiking Hybrid Network (GSHN) that integrates the complementary advantages of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to encode visual semantic information. Intriguingly, the model not only encodes the discrete and continuous latent variables of instances but also adeptly captures both local and global contextual features, thereby significantly enhancing the richness and diversity of semantic representations. Leveraging the spatiotemporal properties inherent in SNNs, we employ contrastive learning (CL) to enhance the similarity-based representation of embeddings. This strategy alleviates the computational overhead of the model and enriches meaningful visual representations by constructing positive and negative sample pairs. We design an innovative pre-training method, Spiked Text Learning (STL), which uses text features to improve the encoding ability of discrete semantics. Experiments show that the proposed GSHN exhibits promising results on multiple VL downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Fairness Analysis of CLIP-Based Foundation Models for X-Ray Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray imaging is pivotal in medical diagnostics, offering non-invasive insights into a range of health conditions. Recently, vision-language models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model, have demonstrated potential in improving diagnostic accuracy by leveraging large-scale image-text datasets. However, since CLIP was not initially designed for medical images, several CLIP-like models trained specifically on medical images have been developed. Despite their enhanced performance, issues of fairness - particularly regarding demographic attributes - remain largely unaddressed. In this study, we perform a comprehensive fairness analysis of CLIP-like models applied to X-ray image classification. We assess their performance and fairness across diverse patient demographics and disease categories using zero-shot inference and various fine-tuning techniques, including Linear Probing, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and full fine-tuning. Our results indicate that while fine-tuning improves model accuracy, fairness concerns persist, highlighting the need for further fairness interventions in these foundational models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro-expression recognition plays a pivotal role in understanding hidden emotions and has applications across various fields. Traditional recognition methods assume access to all training data at once, but real-world scenarios involve continuously evolving data streams. To respond to the requirement of adapting to new data while retaining previously learned knowledge, we introduce the first benchmark specifically designed for incremental micro-expression recognition. Our contributions include: Firstly, we formulate the incremental learning setting tailored for micro-expression recognition. Secondly, we organize sequential datasets with carefully curated learning orders to reflect real-world scenarios. Thirdly, we define two cross-evaluation-based testing protocols, each targeting distinct evaluation objectives. Finally, we provide six baseline methods and their corresponding evaluation results. This benchmark lays the groundwork for advancing incremental micro-expression recognition research. All code used in this study will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Principal Components for Neural Network Initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a commonly used tool for dimension reduction and denoising. Therefore, it is also widely used on the data prior to training a neural network. However, this approach can complicate the explanation of explainable AI (XAI) methods for the decision of the model. In this work, we analyze the potential issues with this approach and propose Principal Components-based Initialization (PCsInit), a strategy to incorporate PCA into the first layer of a neural network via initialization of the first layer in the network with the principal components, and its two variants PCsInit-Act and PCsInit-Sub. Explanations using these strategies are as direct and straightforward as for neural networks and are simpler than using PCA prior to training a neural network on the principal components. Moreover, as will be illustrated in the experiments, such training strategies can also allow further improvement of training via backpropagation.</description>

      <title>FedRTS: Federated Robust Pruning via Combinatorial Thompson Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without data sharing, but its high computational and communication demands strain resource-constrained devices. While existing methods use dynamic pruning to improve efficiency by periodically adjusting sparse model topologies while maintaining sparsity, these approaches suffer from issues such as greedy adjustments, unstable topologies, and communication inefficiency, resulting in less robust models and suboptimal performance under data heterogeneity and partial client availability. To address these challenges, we propose Federated Robust pruning via combinatorial Thompson Sampling (FedRTS), a novel framework designed to develop robust sparse models. FedRTS enhances robustness and performance through its Thompson Sampling-based Adjustment (TSAdj) mechanism, which uses probabilistic decisions informed by stable, farsighted information instead of deterministic decisions reliant on unstable and myopic information in previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedRTS achieves state-of-the-art performance in computer vision and natural language processing tasks while reducing communication costs, particularly excelling in scenarios with heterogeneous data distributions and partial client participation.

      <title>Shaping Sparse Rewards in Reinforcement Learning: A Semi-supervised Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, reward signal for agents are exceedingly sparse, making it challenging to learn an effective reward function for reward shaping. To address this issue, our approach performs reward shaping not only by utilizing non-zero-reward transitions but also by employing the Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) technique combined with a novel data augmentation to learn trajectory space representations from the majority of transitions, zero-reward transitions, thereby improving the efficacy of reward shaping. Experimental results in Atari and robotic manipulation demonstrate that our method effectively generalizes reward shaping to sparse reward scenarios, achieving up to four times better performance in reaching higher best scores compared to curiosity-driven methods. The proposed double entropy data augmentation enhances performance, showcasing a 15.8\% increase in best score over other augmentation methods.</description>

      <title>Decorrelated Soft Actor-Critic for Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of credit assignment in reinforcement learning (RL) when dealing with high-dimensional data is influenced by the success of representation learning via deep neural networks, and has implications for the sample efficiency of deep RL algorithms. Input decorrelation has been previously introduced as a method to speed up optimization in neural networks, and has proven impactful in both efficient deep learning and as a method for effective representation learning for deep RL algorithms. We propose a novel approach to online decorrelation in deep RL based on the decorrelated backpropagation algorithm that seamlessly integrates the decorrelation process into the RL training pipeline. Decorrelation matrices are added to each layer, which are updated using a separate decorrelation learning rule that minimizes the total decorrelation loss across all layers, in parallel to minimizing the usual RL loss. We used our approach in combination with the soft actor-critic (SAC) method, which we refer to as decorrelated soft actor-critic (DSAC). Experiments on the Atari 100k benchmark with DSAC shows, compared to the regular SAC baseline, faster training in five out of the seven games tested and improved reward performance in two games with around 50% reduction in wall-clock time, while maintaining performance levels on the other games. These results demonstrate the positive impact of network-wide decorrelation in deep RL for speeding up its sample efficiency through more effective credit assignment.</description>

      <title>A Metric for the Balance of Information in Graph Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph learning on molecules makes use of information from both the molecular structure and the features attached to that structure. Much work has been conducted on biasing either towards structure or features, with the aim that bias bolsters performance. Identifying which information source a dataset favours, and therefore how to approach learning that dataset, is an open issue. Here we propose Noise-Noise Ratio Difference (NNRD), a quantitative metric for whether there is more useful information in structure or features. By employing iterative noising on features and structure independently, leaving the other intact, NNRD measures the degradation of information in each. We employ NNRD over a range of molecular tasks, and show that it corresponds well to a loss of information, with intuitive results that are more expressive than simple performance aggregates. Our future work will focus on expanding data domains, tasks and types, as well as refining our choice of baseline model.</description>

      <title>Improving Multi-Label Contrastive Learning by Leveraging Label Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multi-label learning, leveraging contrastive learning to learn better representations faces a key challenge: selecting positive and negative samples and effectively utilizing label information. Previous studies selected positive and negative samples based on the overlap between labels and used them for label-wise loss balancing. However, these methods suffer from a complex selection process and fail to account for the varying importance of different labels. To address these problems, we propose a novel method that improves multi-label contrastive learning through label distribution. Specifically, when selecting positive and negative samples, we only need to consider whether there is an intersection between labels. To model the relationships between labels, we introduce two methods to recover label distributions from logical labels, based on Radial Basis Function (RBF) and contrastive loss, respectively. We evaluate our method on nine widely used multi-label datasets, including image and vector datasets. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in six evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>SWAT: Sliding Window Adversarial Training for Gradual Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain shifts are critical issues that harm the performance of machine learning. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) mitigates this issue but suffers when the domain shifts are steep and drastic. Gradual Domain Adaptation (GDA) alleviates this problem in a mild way by gradually adapting from the source to the target domain using multiple intermediate domains. In this paper, we propose Sliding Window Adversarial Training (SWAT) for Gradual Domain Adaptation. SWAT uses the construction of adversarial streams to connect the feature spaces of the source and target domains. In order to gradually narrow the small gap between adjacent intermediate domains, a sliding window paradigm is designed that moves along the adversarial stream. When the window moves to the end of the stream, i.e., the target domain, the domain shift is drastically reduced. Extensive experiments are conducted on public GDA benchmarks, and the results demonstrate that the proposed SWAT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. The implementation is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SWAT-8677.</description>

      <title>Augmented Intelligence for Multimodal Virtual Biopsy in Breast Cancer Using Generative Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full-Field Digital Mammography (FFDM) is the primary imaging modality for routine breast cancer screening; however, its effectiveness is limited in patients with dense breast tissue or fibrocystic conditions. Contrast-Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM), a second-level imaging technique, offers enhanced accuracy in tumor detection. Nonetheless, its application is restricted due to higher radiation exposure, the use of contrast agents, and limited accessibility. As a result, CESM is typically reserved for select cases, leaving many patients to rely solely on FFDM despite the superior diagnostic performance of CESM. While biopsy remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis, it is an invasive procedure that can cause discomfort for patients. We introduce a multimodal, multi-view deep learning approach for virtual biopsy, integrating FFDM and CESM modalities in craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique views to classify lesions as malignant or benign. To address the challenge of missing CESM data, we leverage generative artificial intelligence to impute CESM images from FFDM scans. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating the CESM modality is crucial to enhance the performance of virtual biopsy. When real CESM data is missing, synthetic CESM images proved effective, outperforming the use of FFDM alone, particularly in multimodal configurations that combine FFDM and CESM modalities. The proposed approach has the potential to improve diagnostic workflows, providing clinicians with augmented intelligence tools to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care. Additionally, as a contribution to the research community, we publicly release the dataset used in our experiments, facilitating further advancements in this field.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Model Defense Against Jailbreaks with Proactive Safety Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are vital for a wide range of applications yet remain susceptible to jailbreak threats, which could lead to the generation of inappropriate responses. Conventional defenses, such as refusal and adversarial training, often fail to cover corner cases or rare domains, leaving LLMs still vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks. We propose a novel defense strategy, Safety Chain-of-Thought (SCoT), which harnesses the enhanced \textit{reasoning capabilities} of LLMs for proactive assessment of harmful inputs, rather than simply blocking them. SCoT augments any refusal training datasets to critically analyze the intent behind each request before generating answers. By employing proactive reasoning, SCoT enhances the generalization of LLMs across varied harmful queries and scenarios not covered in the safety alignment corpus. Additionally, it generates detailed refusals specifying the rules violated. Comparative evaluations show that SCoT significantly surpasses existing defenses, reducing vulnerability to out-of-distribution issues and adversarial manipulations while maintaining strong general capabilities.</description>

      <title>Secured Communication Schemes for UAVs in 5G: CRYSTALS-Kyber and IDS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a secure communication architecture for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and ground stations in 5G networks, addressing critical challenges in network security. The proposed solution integrates the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and CRYSTALS-Kyber for key encapsulation, offering a hybrid cryptographic approach. By incorporating CRYSTALS-Kyber, the framework mitigates vulnerabilities in ECC against quantum attacks, positioning it as a quantum-resistant alternative. The architecture is based on a server-client model, with UAVs functioning as clients and the ground station acting as the server. The system was rigorously evaluated in both VPN and 5G environments. Experimental results confirm that CRYSTALS-Kyber delivers strong protection against quantum threats with minimal performance overhead, making it highly suitable for UAVs with resource constraints. Moreover, the proposed architecture integrates an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to further enhance security. In performance evaluations, the IDS demonstrated strong results across multiple models with XGBoost, particularly in more demanding scenarios, outperforming other models with an accuracy of 97.33% and an AUC of 0.94. These findings underscore the potential of combining quantum-resistant encryption mechanisms with AI-driven IDS to create a robust, scalable, and secure communication framework for UAV networks, particularly within the high-performance requirements of 5G environments.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Early Stopping: Refine, Then Calibrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning classifiers often produce probabilistic predictions that are critical for accurate and interpretable decision-making in various domains. The quality of these predictions is generally evaluated with proper losses like cross-entropy, which decompose into two components: calibration error assesses general under/overconfidence, while refinement error measures the ability to distinguish different classes. In this paper, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that these two errors are not minimized simultaneously during training. Selecting the best training epoch based on validation loss thus leads to a compromise point that is suboptimal for both calibration error and, most importantly, refinement error. To address this, we introduce a new metric for early stopping and hyperparameter tuning that makes it possible to minimize refinement error during training. The calibration error is minimized after training, using standard techniques. Our method integrates seamlessly with any architecture and consistently improves performance across diverse classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Reasoning with Hidden Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has become a powerful framework for improving complex problem-solving capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, the verbose nature of textual reasoning introduces significant inefficiencies. In this work, we propose $\textbf{Heima}$ (as hidden llama), an efficient reasoning framework that leverages reasoning CoTs at hidden latent space. We design the Heima Encoder to condense each intermediate CoT into a compact, higher-level hidden representation using a single thinking token, effectively minimizing verbosity and reducing the overall number of tokens required during the reasoning process. Meanwhile, we design corresponding Heima Decoder with traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) to adaptively interpret the hidden representations into variable-length textual sequence, reconstructing reasoning processes that closely resemble the original CoTs. Experimental results across diverse reasoning MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that Heima model achieves higher generation efficiency while maintaining or even better zero-shot task accuracy. Moreover, the effective reconstruction of multimodal reasoning processes with Heima Decoder validates both the robustness and interpretability of our approach.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epithelial cells form diverse structures from squamous spherical organoids to densely packed pseudostratified tissues. Quantification of cellular properties in these contexts requires high-resolution deep imaging and computational techniques to achieve truthful three-dimensional (3D) structural features. Here, we describe a detailed step-by-step protocol for sample preparation, imaging and deep-learning-assisted cell segmentation to achieve accurate quantification of fluorescently labelled individual cells in 3D within live tissues. We share the lessons learned through troubleshooting 3D imaging of Drosophila wing discs, including considerations on the choice of microscopy modality and settings (objective, sample mounting) and available segmentation methods. In addition, we include a computational pipeline alongside custom code to assist replication of the protocol. While we focus on the segmentation of cell outlines from membrane labelling, this protocol applies to a wide variety of samples, and we believe it be valuable for studying other tissues that demand complex analysis in 3D.</description>

      <title>Strassen Attention: Unlocking Compositional Abilities in Transformers Based on a New Lower Bound Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to evaluate the theoretical limits of Transformers, allowing us to prove the first lower bounds against one-layer softmax Transformers with infinite precision. We establish those bounds for three tasks that require advanced reasoning. The first task, Match3 (Sanford et al., 2023), requires looking at all triples of positions. The second and third tasks address compositionality-based reasoning: one is composition of functions (Peng et al., 2024) and the other is composition of binary relations. We formally prove the inability of one-layer softmax Transformers to solve any of these tasks. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, we introduce Strassen attention and prove that with this mechanism a one-layer Transformer can in principle solve all these tasks. We also show that it enjoys sub-cubic running-time complexity, making it more scalable than similar previously proposed mechanisms, such as higher-order attention (Sanford et al., 2023). To complement our theoretical findings, we experimentally studied Strassen attention and compared it against standard (Vaswani et al, 2017), higher-order attention (Sanford et al., 2023) and triangular attention (Bergen et al. 2021). Our results help to disentangle all these attention mechanisms, highlighting their strengths and limitations. In particular, Strassen attention outperforms standard attention significantly on all the tasks. Altogether, understanding the theoretical limitations can guide research towards scalable attention mechanisms that improve the reasoning abilities of Transformers.</description>

      <title>Integrating Semi-Supervised and Active Learning for Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel active learning approach integrated with an improved semi-supervised learning framework to reduce the cost of manual annotation and enhance model performance. Our proposed approach effectively leverages both the labelled data selected through active learning and the unlabelled data excluded from the selection process. The proposed active learning approach pinpoints areas where the pseudo-labels are likely to be inaccurate. Then, an automatic and efficient pseudo-label auto-refinement (PLAR) module is proposed to correct pixels with potentially erroneous pseudo-labels by comparing their feature representations with those of labelled regions. This approach operates without increasing the labelling budget and is based on the cluster assumption, which states that pixels belonging to the same class should exhibit similar representations in feature space. Furthermore, manual labelling is only applied to the most difficult and uncertain areas in unlabelled data, where insufficient information prevents the PLAR module from making a decision. We evaluated the proposed hybrid semi-supervised active learning framework on two benchmark datasets, one from natural and the other from remote sensing imagery domains. In both cases, it outperformed state-of-the-art methods in the semantic segmentation task.</description>

      <title>A Zero-Shot Generalization Framework for LLM-Driven Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot cross-domain sequential recommendation (ZCDSR) enables predictions in unseen domains without the need for additional training or fine-tuning, making it particularly valuable in data-sparse environments where traditional models struggle. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved ZCDSR by leveraging rich pretrained representations to facilitate cross-domain knowledge transfer. However, a key challenge persists: domain semantic bias, which arises from variations in vocabulary and content focus across domains. This misalignment leads to inconsistencies in item embeddings and hinders generalization.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel framework designed to enhance LLM-based ZCDSR by improving cross-domain alignment at both the item and sequential levels. At the item level, we introduce a generalization loss that promotes inter-domain compactness by aligning embeddings of similar items across domains while maintaining intra-domain diversity to preserve unique item characteristics. This prevents embeddings from becoming overly generic while ensuring effective transferability. At the sequential level, we develop a method for transferring user behavioral patterns by clustering user sequences in the source domain and applying attention-based aggregation for target domain inference. This dynamic adaptation of user embeddings allows effective zero-shot recommendations without requiring target-domain interactions.
  Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and domains demonstrate that our framework significantly improves sequential recommendation performance in the ZCDSR setting. By mitigating domain bias and enhancing the transferability of sequential patterns, our method provides a scalable and robust approach for achieving more effective zero-shot recommendations across domains.</description>

      <title>Linear $Q$-Learning Does Not Diverge: Convergence Rates to a Bounded Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $Q$-learning is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms. Previously, it is widely believed that $Q$-learning with linear function approximation (i.e., linear $Q$-learning) suffers from possible divergence. This paper instead establishes the first $L^2$ convergence rate of linear $Q$-learning to a bounded set. Notably, we do not make any modification to the original linear $Q$-learning algorithm, do not make any Bellman completeness assumption, and do not make any near-optimality assumption on the behavior policy. All we need is an $\epsilon$-softmax behavior policy with an adaptive temperature. The key to our analysis is the general result of stochastic approximations under Markovian noise with fast-changing transition functions. As a side product, we also use this general result to establish the $L^2$ convergence rate of tabular $Q$-learning with an $\epsilon$-softmax behavior policy, for which we rely on a novel pseudo-contraction property of the weighted Bellman optimality operator.</description>

      <title>Analysis of LLMs vs Human Experts in Requirements Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The majority of research around Large Language Models (LLM) application to software development has been on the subject of code generation. There is little literature on LLMs' impact on requirements engineering (RE), which deals with the process of developing and verifying the system requirements. Within RE, there is a subdiscipline of requirements elicitation, which is the practice of discovering and documenting requirements for a system from users, customers, and other stakeholders. In this analysis, we compare LLM's ability to elicit requirements of a software system, as compared to that of a human expert in a time-boxed and prompt-boxed study. We found LLM-generated requirements were evaluated as more aligned (+1.12) than human-generated requirements with a trend of being more complete (+10.2%). Conversely, we found users tended to believe that solutions they perceived as more aligned had been generated by human experts. Furthermore, while LLM-generated documents scored higher and performed at 720x the speed, their cost was, on average, only 0.06% that of a human expert. Overall, these findings indicate that LLMs will play an increasingly important role in requirements engineering by improving requirements definitions, enabling more efficient resource allocation, and reducing overall project timelines.</description>

      <title>Beyond checkmate: exploring the creative chokepoints in AI text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), unlocking unprecedented capabilities. This rapid advancement has spurred research into various aspects of LLMs, their text generation &amp; reasoning capability, and potential misuse, fueling the necessity for robust detection methods. While numerous prior research has focused on detecting LLM-generated text (AI text) and thus checkmating them, our study investigates a relatively unexplored territory: portraying the nuanced distinctions between human and AI texts across text segments. Whether LLMs struggle with or excel at incorporating linguistic ingenuity across different text segments carries substantial implications for determining their potential as effective creative assistants to humans. Through an analogy with the structure of chess games-comprising opening, middle, and end games-we analyze text segments (introduction, body, and conclusion) to determine where the most significant distinctions between human and AI texts exist. While AI texts can approximate the body segment better due to its increased length, a closer examination reveals a pronounced disparity, highlighting the importance of this segment in AI text detection. Additionally, human texts exhibit higher cross-segment differences compared to AI texts. Overall, our research can shed light on the intricacies of human-AI text distinctions, offering novel insights for text detection and understanding.</description>

      <title>Language Bias in Self-Supervised Learning For Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is used in deep learning to train on large datasets without the need for expensive labelling of the data. Recently, large Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models such as XLS-R have utilised SSL to train on over one hundred different languages simultaneously. However, deeper investigation shows that the bulk of the training data for XLS-R comes from a small number of languages. Biases learned through SSL have been shown to exist in multiple domains, but language bias in multilingual SSL ASR has not been thoroughly examined. In this paper, we utilise the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) to identify language-specific subnetworks within XLS-R and test the performance of these subnetworks on a variety of different languages. We are able to show that when fine-tuning, XLS-R bypasses traditional linguistic knowledge and builds only on weights learned from the languages with the largest data contribution to the pretraining data.</description>

      <title>Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding for Efficient LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding (RSD), a novel framework aimed at improving the efficiency of inference in large language models (LLMs). RSD synergistically combines a lightweight draft model with a more powerful target model, incorporating a controlled bias to prioritize high-reward outputs, in contrast to existing speculative decoding methods that enforce strict unbiasedness. RSD employs a process reward model to evaluate intermediate decoding steps and dynamically decide whether to invoke the target model, optimizing the trade-off between computational cost and output quality. We theoretically demonstrate that a threshold-based mixture strategy achieves an optimal balance between resource utilization and performance. Extensive evaluations on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including Olympiad-level tasks, show that RSD delivers significant efficiency gains against decoding with the target model only (up to 4.4x fewer FLOPs), while achieving significant better accuracy than parallel decoding method on average (up to +3.5). These results highlight RSD as a robust and cost-effective approach for deploying LLMs in resource-intensive scenarios.</description>

      <title>Capturing Temporal Dynamics in Large-Scale Canopy Tree Height Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise in global greenhouse gas emissions, accurate large-scale tree canopy height maps are essential for understanding forest structure, estimating above-ground biomass, and monitoring ecological disruptions. To this end, we present a novel approach to generate large-scale, high-resolution canopy height maps over time. Our model accurately predicts canopy height over multiple years given Sentinel-2 time series satellite data. Using GEDI LiDAR data as the ground truth for training the model, we present the first 10m resolution temporal canopy height map of the European continent for the period 2019-2022. As part of this product, we also offer a detailed canopy height map for 2020, providing more precise estimates than previous studies. Our pipeline and the resulting temporal height map are publicly available, enabling comprehensive large-scale monitoring of forests and, hence, facilitating future research and ecological analyses.

      <title>What is causal about causal models and representations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal Bayesian networks are 'causal' models since they make predictions about interventional distributions. To connect such causal model predictions to real-world outcomes, we must determine which actions in the world correspond to which interventions in the model. For example, to interpret an action as an intervention on a treatment variable, the action will presumably have to a) change the distribution of treatment in a way that corresponds to the intervention, and b) not change other aspects, such as how the outcome depends on the treatment; while the marginal distributions of some variables may change as an effect. We introduce a formal framework to make such requirements for different interpretations of actions as interventions precise. We prove that the seemingly natural interpretation of actions as interventions is circular: Under this interpretation, every causal Bayesian network that correctly models the observational distribution is trivially also interventionally valid, and no action yields empirical data that could possibly falsify such a model. We prove an impossibility result: No interpretation exists that is non-circular and simultaneously satisfies a set of natural desiderata. Instead, we examine non-circular interpretations that may violate some desiderata and show how this may in turn enable the falsification of causal models. By rigorously examining how a causal Bayesian network could be a 'causal' model of the world instead of merely a mathematical object, our formal framework contributes to the conceptual foundations of causal representation learning, causal discovery, and causal abstraction, while also highlighting some limitations of existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Pathological MRI Segmentation by Synthetic Pathological Data Generation in Fetuses and Neonates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing new methods for the automated analysis of clinical fetal and neonatal MRI data is limited by the scarcity of annotated pathological datasets and privacy concerns that often restrict data sharing, hindering the effectiveness of deep learning models. We address this in two ways. First, we introduce Fetal&amp;Neonatal-DDPM, a novel diffusion model framework designed to generate high-quality synthetic pathological fetal and neonatal MRIs from semantic label images. Second, we enhance training data by modifying healthy label images through morphological alterations to simulate conditions such as ventriculomegaly, cerebellar and pontocerebellar hypoplasia, and microcephaly. By leveraging Fetal&amp;Neonatal-DDPM, we synthesize realistic pathological MRIs from these modified pathological label images. Radiologists rated the synthetic MRIs as significantly (p &lt; 0.05) superior in quality and diagnostic value compared to real MRIs, demonstrating features such as blood vessels and choroid plexus, and improved alignment with label annotations. Synthetic pathological data enhanced state-of-the-art nnUNet segmentation performance, particularly for severe ventriculomegaly cases, with the greatest improvements achieved in ventricle segmentation (Dice scores: 0.9253 vs. 0.7317). This study underscores the potential of generative AI as transformative tool for data augmentation, offering improved segmentation performance in pathological cases. This development represents a significant step towards improving analysis and segmentation accuracy in prenatal imaging, and also offers new ways for data anonymization through the generation of pathologic image data.</description>

      <title>Do Large Multimodal Models Solve Caption Generation for Scientific Figures? Lessons Learned from SCICAP Challenge 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the SCICAP datasets launch in 2021, the research community has made significant progress in generating captions for scientific figures in scholarly articles. In 2023, the first SCICAP Challenge took place, inviting global teams to use an expanded SCICAP dataset to develop models for captioning diverse figure types across various academic fields. At the same time, text generation models advanced quickly, with many powerful pre-trained large multimodal models (LMMs) emerging that showed impressive capabilities in various vision-and-language tasks. This paper presents an overview of the first SCICAP Challenge and details the performance of various models on its data, capturing a snapshot of the fields state. We found that professional editors overwhelmingly preferred figure captions generated by GPT-4V over those from all other models and even the original captions written by authors. Following this key finding, we conducted detailed analyses to answer this question: Have advanced LMMs solved the task of generating captions for scientific figures?</description>

      <title>We're Different, We're the Same: Creative Homogeneity Across LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous powerful large language models (LLMs) are now available for use as writing support tools, idea generators, and beyond. Although these LLMs are marketed as helpful creative assistants, several works have shown that using an LLM as a creative partner results in a narrower set of creative outputs. However, these studies only consider the effects of interacting with a single LLM, begging the question of whether such narrowed creativity stems from using a particular LLM -- which arguably has a limited range of outputs -- or from using LLMs in general as creative assistants. To study this question, we elicit creative responses from humans and a broad set of LLMs using standardized creativity tests and compare the population-level diversity of responses. We find that LLM responses are much more similar to other LLM responses than human responses are to each other, even after controlling for response structure and other key variables. This finding of significant homogeneity in creative outputs across the LLMs we evaluate adds a new dimension to the ongoing conversation about creativity and LLMs. If today's LLMs behave similarly, using them as a creative partners -- regardless of the model used -- may drive all users towards a limited set of "creative" outputs.</description>

      <title>CoSTI: Consistency Models for (a faster) Spatio-Temporal Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Imputation (MTSI) is crucial for many applications, such as healthcare monitoring and traffic management, where incomplete data can compromise decision-making. Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models have recently been shown capable of performing regression tasks wherein numeric predictions are represented as decoded strings. In this work, we provide theoretical grounds for this capability and furthermore investigate the utility of causal auto-regressive sequence models when they are applied to any feature representation. We find that, despite being trained in the usual way - for next-token prediction via cross-entropy loss - decoding-based regression is as performant as traditional approaches for tabular regression tasks, while being flexible enough to capture arbitrary distributions, such as in the task of density estimation.</description>

      <title>s1: Simple test-time scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-time scaling is a promising new approach to language modeling that uses extra test-time compute to improve performance. Recently, OpenAI's o1 model showed this capability but did not publicly share its methodology, leading to many replication efforts. We seek the simplest approach to achieve test-time scaling and strong reasoning performance. First, we curate a small dataset s1K of 1,000 questions paired with reasoning traces relying on three criteria we validate through ablations: difficulty, diversity, and quality. Second, we develop budget forcing to control test-time compute by forcefully terminating the model's thinking process or lengthening it by appending "Wait" multiple times to the model's generation when it tries to end. This can lead the model to double-check its answer, often fixing incorrect reasoning steps. After supervised finetuning the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct language model on s1K and equipping it with budget forcing, our model s1 exceeds o1-preview on competition math questions by up to 27% (MATH and AIME24). Further, scaling s1 with budget forcing allows extrapolating beyond its performance without test-time intervention: from 50% to 57% on AIME24. Our model, data, and code are open-source at https://github.com/simplescaling/s1.</description>

      <title>Scalable-Softmax Is Superior for Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The maximum element of the vector output by the Softmax function approaches zero as the input vector size increases. Transformer-based language models rely on Softmax to compute attention scores, causing the attention distribution to flatten as the context size grows. This reduces the model's ability to prioritize key information effectively and potentially limits its length generalization. To address this problem, we propose Scalable-Softmax (SSMax), which replaces Softmax in scenarios where the input vector size varies. SSMax can be seamlessly integrated into existing Transformer-based architectures. Experimental results in language modeling show that models using SSMax not only achieve faster loss reduction during pretraining but also significantly improve performance in long contexts and key information retrieval. Furthermore, an analysis of attention scores reveals that SSMax enables the model to focus attention on key information even in long contexts. Additionally, although models that use SSMax from the beginning of pretraining achieve better length generalization, those that have already started pretraining can still gain some of this ability by replacing Softmax in the attention layers with SSMax, either during or after pretraining.</description>

      <title>Vintix: Action Model via In-Context Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) represents a promising paradigm for developing generalist agents that learn at inference time through trial-and-error interactions, analogous to how large language models adapt contextually, but with a focus on reward maximization. However, the scalability of ICRL beyond toy tasks and single-domain settings remains an open challenge. In this work, we present the first steps toward scaling ICRL by introducing a fixed, cross-domain model capable of learning behaviors through in-context reinforcement learning. Our results demonstrate that Algorithm Distillation, a framework designed to facilitate ICRL, offers a compelling and competitive alternative to expert distillation to construct versatile action models. These findings highlight the potential of ICRL as a scalable approach for generalist decision-making systems. Code to be released at https://github.com/dunnolab/vintix</description>

      <title>Redefining Machine Unlearning: A Conformal Prediction-Motivated Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to systematically remove specified data from a trained model, effectively achieving a state as though the data had never been encountered during training. While metrics such as Unlearning Accuracy (UA) and Membership Inference Attack (MIA) provide a baseline for assessing unlearning performance, they fall short of evaluating the completeness and reliability of forgetting. This is because the ground truth labels remain potential candidates within the scope of uncertainty quantification, leaving gaps in the evaluation of true forgetting. In this paper, we identify critical limitations in existing unlearning metrics and propose enhanced evaluation metrics inspired by conformal prediction. Our metrics can effectively capture the extent to which ground truth labels are excluded from the prediction set. Furthermore, we observe that many existing machine unlearning methods do not achieve satisfactory forgetting performance when evaluated with our new metrics. To address this, we propose an unlearning framework that integrates conformal prediction insights into Carlini &amp; Wagner adversarial attack loss. Extensive experiments on the image classification task demonstrate that our enhanced metrics offer deeper insights into unlearning effectiveness, and that our unlearning framework significantly improves the forgetting quality of unlearning methods.</description>

      <title>AI Biases Towards Rich and Powerful Surnames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surnames often convey implicit markers of social status, wealth, and lineage, shaping perceptions in ways that can perpetuate systemic biases. This study investigates whether and how surnames influence AI-driven decision-making, focusing on their effects across key areas such as hiring recommendations, leadership appointments, and loan approvals. Drawing on 600 surnames from the United States and Thailand, countries with differing sociohistorical dynamics and surname conventions, we categorize names into Rich, Legacy, Normal, and phonetically similar Variant groups. Our findings reveal that elite surnames consistently predict AI-generated perceptions of power, intelligence, and wealth, leading to significant consequences for decisions in high-stakes situations. Mediation analysis highlights perceived intelligence as a crucial pathway through which surname biases operate. Providing objective qualifications alongside the surnames reduces, but does not eliminate, these biases, especially in contexts with uniformly low credentials. These results call for fairness-aware algorithms and robust policy interventions to mitigate the reinforcement of inherited inequalities by AI systems. Our work also urges a reexamination of algorithmic accountability and its societal impact, particularly in systems designed for meritocratic outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empowering safe exploration of reinforcement learning (RL) agents during training is a critical challenge towards their deployment in many real-world scenarios. When prior knowledge of the domain or task is unavailable, training RL agents in unknown, \textit{black-box} environments presents an even greater safety risk. We introduce \mbox{ADVICE} (Adaptive Shielding with a Contrastive Autoencoder), a novel post-shielding technique that distinguishes safe and unsafe features of state-action pairs during training, and uses this knowledge to protect the RL agent from executing actions that yield likely hazardous outcomes. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art safe RL exploration techniques shows that ADVICE significantly reduces safety violations ($\approx\!\!50\%$) during training, with a competitive outcome reward compared to other techniques.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Modal Explainability Approach for Human-Aware Robots in Multi-Party Conversation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The addressee estimation (understanding to whom somebody is talking) is a fundamental task for human activity recognition in multi-party conversation scenarios. Specifically, in the field of human-robot interaction, it becomes even more crucial to enable social robots to participate in such interactive contexts. However, it is usually implemented as a binary classification task, restricting the robot's capability to estimate whether it was addressed \review{or not, which} limits its interactive skills. For a social robot to gain the trust of humans, it is also important to manifest a certain level of transparency and explainability. Explainable artificial intelligence thus plays a significant role in the current machine learning applications and models, to provide explanations for their decisions besides excellent performance. In our work, we a) present an addressee estimation model with improved performance in comparison with the previous state-of-the-art; b) further modify this model to include inherently explainable attention-based segments; c) implement the explainable addressee estimation as part of a modular cognitive architecture for multi-party conversation in an iCub robot; d) validate the real-time performance of the explainable model in multi-party human-robot interaction; e) propose several ways to incorporate explainability and transparency in the aforementioned architecture; and f) perform an online user study to analyze the effect of various explanations on how human participants perceive the robot.</description>

Abstract: A common practice in large language model (LLM) usage for complex analytical tasks such as code generation, is to sample a solution for the entire task within the model's context window. Previous works have shown that subtask decomposition within the model's context (chain of thought), is beneficial for solving such tasks. In this work, we point a limitation of LLMs' ability to perform several sub-tasks within the same context window - an in-context hardness of composition, pointing to an advantage for distributing a decomposed problem in a multi-agent system of LLMs. The hardness of composition is quantified by a generation complexity metric, i.e., the number of LLM generations required to sample at least one correct solution. We find a gap between the generation complexity of solving a compositional problem within the same context relative to distributing it among multiple agents, that increases exponentially with the solution's length. We prove our results theoretically and demonstrate them empirically.</description>

      <title>The Smart Buildings Control Suite: A Diverse Open Source Benchmark to Evaluate and Scale HVAC Control Policies for Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Commercial buildings account for 17% of U.S. carbon emissions, with roughly half of that from Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC). HVAC devices form a complex thermodynamic system, and while Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning have been used to optimize control policies, scaling to thousands of buildings remains a significant unsolved challenge. Most current algorithms are over-optimized for specific buildings and rely on proprietary data or hard-to-configure simulations. We present the Smart Buildings Control Suite, the first open source interactive HVAC control benchmark with a focus on solutions that scale. It consists of 3 components: real-world telemetric data extracted from 11 buildings over 6 years, a lightweight data-driven simulator for each building, and a modular Physically Informed Neural Network (PINN) building model as a simulator alternative. The buildings span a variety of climates, management systems, and sizes, and both the simulator and PINN easily scale to new buildings, ensuring solutions using this benchmark are robust to these factors and only reliant on fully scalable building models. This represents a major step towards scaling HVAC optimization from the lab to buildings everywhere. To facilitate use, our benchmark is compatible with the Gym standard, and our data is part of TensorFlow Datasets.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models are In-context Preference Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning is an effective way to handle tasks where rewards are hard to specify but can be exceedingly inefficient as preference learning is often tabula rasa. We demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) have native preference-learning capabilities that allow them to achieve sample-efficient preference learning, addressing this challenge. We propose In-Context Preference Learning (ICPL), which uses in-context learning capabilities of LLMs to reduce human query inefficiency. ICPL uses the task description and basic environment code to create sets of reward functions which are iteratively refined by placing human feedback over videos of the resultant policies into the context of an LLM and then requesting better rewards. We first demonstrate ICPL's effectiveness through a synthetic preference study, providing quantitative evidence that it significantly outperforms baseline preference-based methods with much higher performance and orders of magnitude greater efficiency. We observe that these improvements are not solely coming from LLM grounding in the task but that the quality of the rewards improves over time, indicating preference learning capabilities. Additionally, we perform a series of real human preference-learning trials and observe that ICPL extends beyond synthetic settings and can work effectively with humans-in-the-loop.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Tree Search for Comprehensive Exploration in LLM-Based Automatic Heuristic Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Handcrafting heuristics for solving complex optimization tasks (e.g., route planning and task allocation) is a common practice but requires extensive domain knowledge. Recently, Large Language Model (LLM)-based automatic heuristic design (AHD) methods have shown promise in generating high-quality heuristics without manual interventions. Existing LLM-based AHD methods employ a population to maintain a fixed number of top-performing LLM-generated heuristics and introduce evolutionary computation (EC) to iteratively enhance the population. However, these population-based procedures cannot fully develop the potential of each heuristic and are prone to converge into local optima. To more comprehensively explore the space of heuristics, this paper proposes to use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for LLM-based heuristic evolution. The proposed MCTS-AHD method organizes all LLM-generated heuristics in a tree structure and can better develop the potential of temporarily underperforming heuristics. In experiments, MCTS-AHD delivers significantly higher-quality heuristics on various complex tasks. Our code is available.</description>

      <title>From Natural Language to Extensive-Form Game Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17282v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for translating game descriptions in natural language into extensive-form representations in game theory, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and in-context learning. Given the varying levels of strategic complexity in games, such as perfect versus imperfect information, directly applying in-context learning would be insufficient. To address this, we introduce a two-stage framework with specialized modules to enhance in-context learning, enabling it to divide and conquer the problem effectively. In the first stage, we tackle the challenge of imperfect information by developing a module that identifies information sets along and the corresponding partial tree structure. With this information, the second stage leverages in-context learning alongside a self-debugging module to produce a complete extensive-form game tree represented using pygambit, the Python API of a recognized game-theoretic analysis tool called Gambit. Using this python representation enables the automation of tasks such as computing Nash equilibria directly from natural language descriptions. We evaluate the performance of the full framework, as well as its individual components, using various LLMs on games with different levels of strategic complexity. Our experimental results show that the framework significantly outperforms baseline models in generating accurate extensive-form games, with each module playing a critical role in its success.</description>

      <title>Think Smarter not Harder: Adaptive Reasoning with Inference Aware Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving mathematics problems has been an intriguing capability of large language models, and many efforts have been made to improve reasoning by extending reasoning length, such as through self-correction and extensive long chain-of-thoughts. While promising in problem-solving, advanced long reasoning chain models exhibit an undesired single-modal behavior, where trivial questions require unnecessarily tedious long chains of thought. In this work, we propose a way to allow models to be aware of inference budgets by formulating it as utility maximization with respect to an inference budget constraint, hence naming our algorithm Inference Budget-Constrained Policy Optimization (IBPO). In a nutshell, models fine-tuned through IBPO learn to ``understand'' the difficulty of queries and allocate inference budgets to harder ones. With different inference budgets, our best models are able to have a $4.14$\% and $5.74$\% absolute improvement ($8.08$\% and $11.2$\% relative improvement) on MATH500 using $2.16$x and $4.32$x inference budgets respectively, relative to LLaMA3.1 8B Instruct. These improvements are approximately $2$x those of self-consistency under the same budgets.</description>

      <title>Loss shaping enhances exact gradient learning with Eventprop in spiking neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01232v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event-based machine learning promises more energy-efficient AI on future neuromorphic hardware. Here, we investigate how the recently discovered Eventprop algorithm for gradient descent on exact gradients in spiking neural networks can be scaled up to challenging keyword recognition benchmarks. We implemented Eventprop in the GPU-enhanced Neural Networks framework and used it for training recurrent spiking neural networks on the Spiking Heidelberg Digits and Spiking Speech Commands datasets. We found that learning depended strongly on the loss function and extended Eventprop to a wider class of loss functions to enable effective training. We then tested a large number of data augmentations and regularisations as well as exploring different network structures; and heterogeneous and trainable timescales. We found that when combined with two specific augmentations, the right regularisation and a delay line input, Eventprop networks with one recurrent layer achieved state-of-the-art performance on Spiking Heidelberg Digits and good accuracy on Spiking Speech Commands. In comparison to a leading surrogate-gradient-based SNN training method, our GeNN Eventprop implementation is 3X faster and uses 4X less memory. This work is a significant step towards a low-power neuromorphic alternative to current machine learning paradigms.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Model Evaluation as Narrowing the Socio-Technical Gap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03100v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent development of generative large language models (LLMs) poses new challenges for model evaluation that the research community and industry have been grappling with. While the versatile capabilities of these models ignite much excitement, they also inevitably make a leap toward homogenization: powering a wide range of applications with a single, often referred to as ``general-purpose'', model. In this position paper, we argue that model evaluation practices must take on a critical task to cope with the challenges and responsibilities brought by this homogenization: providing valid assessments for whether and how much human needs in diverse downstream use cases can be satisfied by the given model (\textit{socio-technical gap}). By drawing on lessons about improving research realism from the social sciences, human-computer interaction (HCI), and the interdisciplinary field of explainable AI (XAI), we urge the community to develop evaluation methods based on real-world contexts and human requirements, and embrace diverse evaluation methods with an acknowledgment of trade-offs between realisms and pragmatic costs to conduct the evaluation. By mapping HCI and current NLG evaluation methods, we identify opportunities for evaluation methods for LLMs to narrow the socio-technical gap and pose open questions.</description>

Abstract: The ever-increasing workload of digital forensic labs raises concerns about law enforcement's ability to conduct both cyber-related and non-cyber-related investigations promptly. Consequently, this article explores the potential and usefulness of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into digital forensic investigations to address challenges such as bias, explainability, censorship, resource-intensive infrastructure, and ethical and legal considerations. A comprehensive literature review is carried out, encompassing existing digital forensic models, tools, LLMs, deep learning techniques, and the use of LLMs in investigations. The review identifies current challenges within existing digital forensic processes and explores both the obstacles and the possibilities of incorporating LLMs. In conclusion, the study states that the adoption of LLMs in digital forensics, with appropriate constraints, has the potential to improve investigation efficiency, improve traceability, and alleviate the technical and judicial barriers faced by law enforcement entities.</description>

      <title>IsolateGPT: An Execution Isolation Architecture for LLM-Based Agentic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) extended as systems, such as ChatGPT, have begun supporting third-party applications. These LLM apps leverage the de facto natural language-based automated execution paradigm of LLMs: that is, apps and their interactions are defined in natural language, provided access to user data, and allowed to freely interact with each other and the system. These LLM app ecosystems resemble the settings of earlier computing platforms, where there was insufficient isolation between apps and the system. Because third-party apps may not be trustworthy, and exacerbated by the imprecision of natural language interfaces, the current designs pose security and privacy risks for users. In this paper, we evaluate whether these issues can be addressed through execution isolation and what that isolation might look like in the context of LLM-based systems, where there are arbitrary natural language-based interactions between system components, between LLM and apps, and between apps. To that end, we propose IsolateGPT, a design architecture that demonstrates the feasibility of execution isolation and provides a blueprint for implementing isolation, in LLM-based systems. We evaluate IsolateGPT against a number of attacks and demonstrate that it protects against many security, privacy, and safety issues that exist in non-isolated LLM-based systems, without any loss of functionality. The performance overhead incurred by IsolateGPT to improve security is under 30% for three-quarters of tested queries.</description>

      <title>Learning Transactions Representations for Information Management in Banks: Mastering Local, Global, and External Knowledge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In today's world, banks use artificial intelligence to optimize diverse business processes, aiming to improve customer experience. Most of the customer-related tasks can be categorized into two groups: 1) local ones, which focus on a client's current state, such as transaction forecasting, and 2) global ones, which consider the general customer behaviour, e.g., predicting successful loan repayment. Unfortunately, maintaining separate models for each task is costly. Therefore, to better facilitate information management, we compared eight state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on 11 tasks in search for a one-size-fits-all solution. Contrastive self-supervised learning methods were demonstrated to excel at global problems, while generative techniques were superior at local tasks. We also introduced a novel approach, which enriches the client's representation by incorporating external information gathered from other clients. Our method outperforms classical models, boosting accuracy by up to 20\%.</description>

      <title>Improving Instruction Following in Language Models through Proxy-Based Uncertainty Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06424v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assessing response quality to instructions in language models is vital but challenging due to the complexity of human language across different contexts. This complexity often results in ambiguous or inconsistent interpretations, making accurate assessment difficult. To address this issue, we propose a novel Uncertainty-aware Reward Model (URM) that introduces a robust uncertainty estimation for the quality of paired responses based on Bayesian approximation. Trained with preference datasets, our uncertainty-enabled proxy not only scores rewards for responses but also evaluates their inherent uncertainty. Empirical results demonstrate significant benefits of incorporating the proposed proxy into language model training. Our method boosts the instruction following capability of language models by refining data curation for training and improving policy optimization objectives, thereby surpassing existing methods by a large margin on benchmarks such as Vicuna and MT-bench. These findings highlight that our proposed approach substantially advances language model training and paves a new way of harnessing uncertainty within language models.</description>

      <title>Policy Gradient Methods for Risk-Sensitive Distributional Reinforcement Learning with Provable Convergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial for maintaining reliable performance in high-stakes applications. While traditional RL methods aim to learn a point estimate of the random cumulative cost, distributional RL (DRL) seeks to estimate the entire distribution of it, which leads to a unified framework for handling different risk measures. However, developing policy gradient methods for risk-sensitive DRL is inherently more complex as it involves finding the gradient of a probability measure. This paper introduces a new policy gradient method for risk-sensitive DRL with general coherent risk measures, where we provide an analytical form of the probability measure's gradient for any distribution. For practical use, we design a categorical distributional policy gradient algorithm (CDPG) that approximates any distribution by a categorical family supported on some fixed points. We further provide a finite-support optimality guarantee and a finite-iteration convergence guarantee under inexact policy evaluation and gradient estimation. Through experiments on stochastic Cliffwalk and CartPole environments, we illustrate the benefits of considering a risk-sensitive setting in DRL.</description>

      <title>Learning Human-Aligned Representations with Contrastive Learning and Generative Similarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans rely on effective representations to learn from few examples and abstract useful information from sensory data. Inducing such representations in machine learning models has been shown to improve their performance on various benchmarks such as few-shot learning and robustness. However, finding effective training procedures to achieve that goal can be challenging as psychologically rich training data such as human similarity judgments are expensive to scale, and Bayesian models of human inductive biases are often intractable for complex, realistic domains. Here, we address this challenge by leveraging a Bayesian notion of generative similarity whereby two data points are considered similar if they are likely to have been sampled from the same distribution. This measure can be applied to complex generative processes, including probabilistic programs. We incorporate generative similarity into a contrastive learning objective to enable learning of embeddings that express human cognitive representations. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by showing that it can be used to capture human-like representations of shape regularity, abstract Euclidean geometric concepts, and semantic hierarchies for natural images.</description>

      <title>LlavaGuard: An Open VLM-based Framework for Safeguarding Vision Datasets and Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces LlavaGuard, a suite of VLM-based vision safeguards that address the critical need for reliable guardrails in the era of large-scale data and models. To this end, we establish a novel open framework, describing a customizable safety taxonomy, data preprocessing, augmentation, and training setup. For teaching a VLM safeguard on safety, we further create a multimodal safety dataset with high-quality human expert annotations, where each image is labeled with a safety rating, category and rationale. We also employ advanced augmentations to support context-specific assessments. The resulting LlavaGuard models, ranging from 0.5B to 7B, serve as a versatile tool for evaluating the safety compliance of visual content against flexible policies. In comprehensive experiments, LlavaGuard outperforms both state-of-the-art safeguards and VLMs in accuracy and in flexibly handling different policies. Additionally, we demonstrate LlavaGuard's performance in two real-world applications: large-scale dataset annotation and moderation of text-to-image models. We make our entire framework publicly available, including the dataset and model weights.</description>

      <title>Towards Systematic Monolingual NLP Surveys: GenA of Greek NLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09861v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) research has traditionally been predominantly focused on English, driven by the availability of resources, the size of the research community, and market demands. Recently, there has been a noticeable shift towards multilingualism in NLP, recognizing the need for inclusivity and effectiveness across diverse languages and cultures. Monolingual surveys have the potential to complement the broader trend towards multilingualism in NLP by providing foundational insights and resources, necessary for effectively addressing the linguistic diversity of global communication. However, monolingual NLP surveys are extremely rare in the literature. This study introduces a generalizable methodology for creating systematic and comprehensive monolingual NLP surveys, aimed at optimizing the process of constructing such surveys and thoroughly addressing a language's NLP support. Our approach integrates a structured search protocol to avoid selection bias and ensure reproducibility, an NLP task taxonomy to organize the surveyed material coherently, and language resources (LRs) taxonomies to identify potential benchmarks and highlight opportunities for improving resource availability (e.g., through better maintenance or licensing). We apply this methodology to Greek NLP (2012-2023), providing a comprehensive overview of its current state and challenges. We discuss the progress of Greek NLP and outline the Greek LRs found, classified by availability and usability, assessing language support per NLP task. The presented systematic literature review of Greek NLP serves as an application of our method that showcases the benefits of monolingual NLP surveys more broadly. Similar applications could be considered for the myriads of languages whose progress in NLP lags behind that of well-supported languages.</description>

      <title>Communication- and Computation-Efficient Distributed Submodular Optimization in Robot Mesh Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a communication- and computation-efficient method for distributed submodular optimization in robot mesh networks. Submodularity is a property of diminishing returns that arises in active information gathering such as mapping, surveillance, and target tracking. Our method, Resource-Aware distributed Greedy (RAG), introduces a new distributed optimization paradigm that enables scalable and near-optimal action coordination. To this end, RAG requires each robot to make decisions based only on information received from and about their neighbors. In contrast, the current paradigms allow the relay of information about all robots across the network. As a result, RAG's decision-time scales linearly with the network size, while state-of-the-art near-optimal submodular optimization algorithms scale cubically. We also characterize how the designed mesh-network topology affects RAG's approximation performance. Our analysis implies that sparser networks favor scalability without proportionally compromising approximation performance: while RAG's decision time scales linearly with network size, the gain in approximation performance scales sublinearly. We demonstrate RAG's performance in simulated scenarios of area detection with up to 45 robots, simulating realistic robot-to-robot (r2r) communication speeds such as the 0.25 Mbps speed of the Digi XBee 3 Zigbee 3.0. In the simulations, RAG enables real-time planning, up to three orders of magnitude faster than competitive near-optimal algorithms, while also achieving superior mean coverage performance. To enable the simulations, we extend the high-fidelity and photo-realistic simulator AirSim by integrating a scalable collaborative autonomy pipeline to tens of robots and simulating r2r communication delays. Our code is available at https://github.com/UM-iRaL/Resource-Aware-Coordination-AirSim.</description>

      <title>Preference Consistency Matters: Enhancing Preference Learning in Language Models with Automated Self-Curation of Training Corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inconsistent annotations in training corpora, particularly within preference learning datasets, pose challenges in developing advanced language models. These inconsistencies often arise from variability among annotators and inherent multi-dimensional nature of the preferences. To address these issues, we introduce a self-curation method that preprocesses annotated datasets by leveraging proxy models trained directly on them. Our method enhances preference learning by automatically detecting and selecting consistent annotations. We validate the proposed approach through extensive instruction-following tasks, demonstrating performance improvements of up to 33\% across various learning algorithms and proxy capabilities. This work offers a straightforward and reliable solution to address preference inconsistencies without relying on heuristics, serving as an initial step toward the development of more advanced preference learning methodologies.

      <title>Predicting the Target Word of Game-playing Conversations using a Low-Rank Dialect Adapter for Decoder Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dialect adapters that improve the performance of LLMs for NLU tasks on certain sociolects/dialects/national varieties ('dialects' for the sake of brevity) have been reported for encoder models. In this paper, we extend the idea of dialect adapters to decoder models in our architecture called LoRDD. Using MD-3, a publicly available dataset of word game-playing conversations between dialectal speakers, our task is Target Word Prediction (TWP) from a masked conversation. LoRDD combines task adapters and dialect adapters where the latter employ contrastive learning on pseudo-parallel conversations from MD-3. Our experiments on Indian English and Nigerian English conversations with two models (Mistral and Gemma) demonstrate that LoRDD outperforms four baselines on TWP. Additionally, it significantly reduces the performance gap with American English, narrowing it to 12% and 5.8% for word similarity, and 25% and 4.5% for accuracy, respectively. The focused contribution of LoRDD is in its promise for dialect adaptation of decoder models using TWP, a simplified version of the commonly used next-word prediction task.</description>

      <title>LUK: Empowering Log Understanding with Expert Knowledge from Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Logs play a critical role in providing essential information for system monitoring and troubleshooting. Recently, with the success of pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP), smaller PLMs (such as BERT) and LLMs (like GPT-4) have become the current mainstream approaches for log analysis. Despite the remarkable capabilities of LLMs, their higher cost and inefficient inference present significant challenges in leveraging the full potential of LLMs to analyze logs. In contrast, smaller PLMs can be fine-tuned for specific tasks even with limited computational resources, making them more practical. However, these smaller PLMs face challenges in understanding logs comprehensively due to their limited expert knowledge. To address the lack of expert knowledge and enhance log understanding for smaller PLMs, this paper introduces a novel and practical knowledge enhancement framework, called LUK, which acquires expert knowledge from LLMs automatically and then enhances the smaller PLM for log analysis with these expert knowledge. LUK can take full advantage of both types of models. Specifically, we design a multi-expert collaboration framework based on LLMs with different roles to acquire expert knowledge. In addition, we propose two novel pre-training tasks to enhance the log pre-training with expert knowledge. LUK achieves state-of-the-art results on different log analysis tasks and extensive experiments demonstrate expert knowledge from LLMs can be utilized more effectively to understand logs. Our source code and detailed experimental data are available at https://github.com/LeaperOvO/LUK.</description>

      <title>SAN: Hypothesizing Long-Term Synaptic Development and Neural Engram Mechanism in Scalable Model's Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) bridged the performance gap with Full Fine-Tuning (FFT) through sophisticated analysis of pre-trained parameter spaces. Starting from drawing insights from Neural Engrams (NE) in Biological Neural Networks (BNNs), we establish a connection between the low-rank property observed during PEFT's parameter space shifting and neurobiological mechanisms. This observation leads to our proposed method, Synapse and Neuron (SAN), which decomposes and propagates scaling components from anterior feature adjusting vectors towards posterior weight matrices. Our approach is theoretically grounded in Long-Term Potentiation/Depression (LTP/D) phenomena, which govern synapse development through neurotransmitter release modulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness: on \textbf{vision tasks} across VTAB, FGVC, and GIC (25 datasets) using ViT, SwinT and ConvNeXt, SAN outperforms FFT up to 8.7% and LoRA by 3.2%; on language tasks using Commonsense Reasoning (8 datasets) with LLaMA models (all generations), surpassing ChatGPT up to 8.5% and LoRA by 4.7%; on visual-language tasks using Mixed Visual Instruction (7 datasets) with LLaVA models, it exceeds FFT up to 2.4% and LoRA by 1.9%. Our code and W&amp;B log will be released in https://github.com/daviddaiiiii/SAN-PEFT</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal language modeling has enabled breakthroughs for representation learning, yet remains unexplored in the realm of functional brain data for pathology detection. This paper pioneers EEG-language models (ELMs) trained on clinical reports and 15000 EEGs. We propose to combine multimodal alignment in this novel domain with timeseries cropping and text segmentation, enabling an extension based on multiple instance learning to alleviate misalignment between irrelevant EEG or text segments. Our multimodal models significantly improve pathology detection compared to EEG-only models across four evaluations and for the first time enable zero-shot classification as well as retrieval of both neural signals and reports. In sum, these results highlight the potential of ELMs, representing significant progress for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>SOAP: Improving and Stabilizing Shampoo using Adam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is growing evidence of the effectiveness of Shampoo, a higher-order preconditioning method, over Adam in deep learning optimization tasks. However, Shampoo's drawbacks include additional hyperparameters and computational overhead when compared to Adam, which only updates running averages of first- and second-moment quantities. This work establishes a formal connection between Shampoo (implemented with the 1/2 power) and Adafactor -- a memory-efficient approximation of Adam -- showing that Shampoo is equivalent to running Adafactor in the eigenbasis of Shampoo's preconditioner. This insight leads to the design of a simpler and computationally efficient algorithm: $\textbf{S}$hampo$\textbf{O}$ with $\textbf{A}$dam in the $\textbf{P}$reconditioner's eigenbasis (SOAP).
  With regards to improving Shampoo's computational efficiency, the most straightforward approach would be to simply compute Shampoo's eigendecomposition less frequently. Unfortunately, as our empirical results show, this leads to performance degradation that worsens with this frequency. SOAP mitigates this degradation by continually updating the running average of the second moment, just as Adam does, but in the current (slowly changing) coordinate basis. Furthermore, since SOAP is equivalent to running Adam in a rotated space, it introduces only one additional hyperparameter (the preconditioning frequency) compared to Adam. We empirically evaluate SOAP on language model pre-training with 360m and 660m sized models. In the large batch regime, SOAP reduces the number of iterations by over 40% and wall clock time by over 35% compared to AdamW, with approximately 20% improvements in both metrics compared to Shampoo. An implementation of SOAP is available at https://github.com/nikhilvyas/SOAP.</description>

      <title>Mamba Fusion: Learning Actions Through Questioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video Language Models (VLMs) are crucial for generalizing across diverse tasks and using language cues to enhance learning. While transformer-based architectures have been the de facto in vision-language training, they face challenges like quadratic computational complexity, high GPU memory usage, and difficulty with long-term dependencies. To address these limitations, we introduce MambaVL, a novel model that leverages recent advancements in selective state space modality fusion to efficiently capture long-range dependencies and learn joint representations for vision and language data. MambaVL utilizes a shared state transition matrix across both modalities, allowing the model to capture information about actions from multiple perspectives within the scene. Furthermore, we propose a question-answering task that helps guide the model toward relevant cues. These questions provide critical information about actions, objects, and environmental context, leading to enhanced performance. As a result, MambaVL achieves state-of-the-art performance in action recognition on the Epic-Kitchens-100 dataset and outperforms baseline methods in action anticipation.</description>

      <title>FPBoost: Fully Parametric Gradient Boosting for Survival Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Survival analysis is a statistical framework for modeling time-to-event data. It plays a pivotal role in medicine, reliability engineering, and social science research, where understanding event dynamics even with few data samples is critical. Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly those employing neural networks and decision trees, have introduced sophisticated algorithms for survival modeling. However, many of these methods rely on restrictive assumptions about the underlying event-time distribution, such as proportional hazard, time discretization, or accelerated failure time. In this study, we propose FPBoost, a survival model that combines a weighted sum of fully parametric hazard functions with gradient boosting. Distribution parameters are estimated with decision trees trained by maximizing the full survival likelihood. We show how FPBoost is a universal approximator of hazard functions, offering full event-time modeling flexibility while maintaining interpretability through the use of well-established parametric distributions. We evaluate concordance and calibration of FPBoost across multiple benchmark datasets, showcasing its robustness and versatility as a new tool for survival estimation.</description>

      <title>Exploring Multilingual Probing in Large Language Models: A Cross-Language Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probing techniques for large language models (LLMs) have primarily focused on English, overlooking the vast majority of the world's languages. In this paper, we extend these probing methods to a multilingual context, investigating the behaviors of LLMs across diverse languages. We conduct experiments on several open-source LLM models, analyzing probing accuracy, trends across layers, and similarities between probing vectors for multiple languages. Our key findings reveal: (1) a consistent performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages, with high-resource languages achieving significantly higher probing accuracy; (2) divergent layer-wise accuracy trends, where high-resource languages show substantial improvement in deeper layers similar to English; and (3) higher representational similarities among high-resource languages, with low-resource languages demonstrating lower similarities both among themselves and with high-resource languages. These results highlight significant disparities in LLMs' multilingual capabilities and emphasize the need for improved modeling of low-resource languages.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Learn-then-Test: Statistically Valid and Efficient Hyperparameter Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce adaptive learn-then-test (aLTT), an efficient hyperparameter selection procedure that provides finite-sample statistical guarantees on the population risk of AI models. Unlike the existing learn-then-test (LTT) technique, which relies on conventional p-value-based multiple hypothesis testing (MHT), aLTT implements sequential data-dependent MHT with early termination by leveraging e-processes. As a result, aLTT can reduce the number of testing rounds, making it particularly well-suited for scenarios in which testing is costly or presents safety risks. Apart from maintaining statistical validity, in applications such as online policy selection for offline reinforcement learning and prompt engineering, aLTT is shown to achieve the same performance as LTT while requiring only a fraction of the testing rounds.</description>

Abstract: In this theoretical article, a sociotechnical approach is proposed to characterize. First, the business ecosystem, focusing on the relationships among Providers, Enterprise, and Customers through SCM, ERP, and CRM platforms to align: (1) Business Intelligence (BI), Fuzzy Logic (FL), and TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving), through the OID model, and (2) Knowledge Management (KM) and Imperfect Knowledge Management (IKM), through the OIDK model. Second, the article explores the E-GenAI business ecosystem, which integrates GenAI-based platforms for SCM, ERP, and CRM with GenAI-based platforms for BI, FL, TRIZ, KM, and IKM, to align Large Language Models (LLMs) through the E-GenAI (OID) model. Finally, to understand the dynamics of LLMs, we utilize finite automata to model the relationships between Followers and Followees. This facilitates the construction of LLMs that can identify specific characteristics of users on a social media platform.</description>

      <title>Beyond Minimax Rates in Group Distributionally Robust Optimization via a Novel Notion of Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimax sample complexity of group distributionally robust optimization (GDRO) has been determined up to a $\log(K)$ factor, where $K$ is the number of groups. In this work, we venture beyond the minimax perspective via a novel notion of sparsity that we dub $(\lambda, \beta)$-sparsity. In short, this condition means that at any parameter $\theta$, there is a set of at most $\beta$ groups whose risks at $\theta$ all are at least $\lambda$ larger than the risks of the other groups. To find an $\epsilon$-optimal $\theta$, we show via a novel algorithm and analysis that the $\epsilon$-dependent term in the sample complexity can swap a linear dependence on $K$ for a linear dependence on the potentially much smaller $\beta$. This improvement leverages recent progress in sleeping bandits, showing a fundamental connection between the two-player zero-sum game optimization framework for GDRO and per-action regret bounds in sleeping bandits. We next show an adaptive algorithm which, up to log factors, gets a sample complexity bound that adapts to the best $(\lambda, \beta)$-sparsity condition that holds. We also show how to get a dimension-free semi-adaptive sample complexity bound with a computationally efficient method. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of the $(\lambda, \beta)$-sparsity condition and the improved sample efficiency of our algorithms on both synthetic and real-life datasets.</description>

      <title>TiVaT: A Transformer with a Single Unified Mechanism for Capturing Asynchronous Dependencies in Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is vital across various domains but remains challenging due to the need to simultaneously model temporal and inter-variate dependencies. Existing channel-dependent models, where Transformer-based models dominate, process these dependencies separately, limiting their capacity to capture complex interactions such as lead-lag dynamics. To address this issue, we propose TiVaT (Time-variate Transformer), a novel architecture incorporating a single unified module, a Joint-Axis (JA) attention module, that concurrently processes temporal and variate modeling. The JA attention module dynamically selects relevant features to particularly capture asynchronous interactions. In addition, we introduce distance-aware time-variate sampling in the JA attention, a novel mechanism that extracts significant patterns through a learned 2D embedding space while reducing noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate TiVaT's overall performance across diverse datasets, particularly excelling in scenarios with intricate asynchronous dependencies.</description>

      <title>Stable Offline Value Function Learning with Bisimulation-based Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01643v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning, offline value function learning is the procedure of using an offline dataset to estimate the expected discounted return from each state when taking actions according to a fixed target policy. The stability of this procedure, i.e., whether it converges to its fixed-point, critically depends on the representations of the state-action pairs. Poorly learned representations can make value function learning unstable, or even divergent. Therefore, it is critical to stabilize value function learning by explicitly shaping the state-action representations. Recently, the class of bisimulation-based algorithms have shown promise in shaping representations for control. However, it is still unclear if this class of methods can stabilize value function learning. In this work, we investigate this question and answer it affirmatively. We introduce a bisimulation-based algorithm called kernel representations for offline policy evaluation (KROPE). KROPE uses a kernel to shape state-action representations such that state-action pairs that have similar immediate rewards and lead to similar next state-action pairs under the target policy also have similar representations. We show that KROPE: 1) learns stable representations and 2) leads to lower value error than baselines. Our analysis provides new theoretical insight into the stability properties of bisimulation-based methods and suggests that practitioners can use these methods for stable and accurate evaluation of offline reinforcement learning agents.</description>

      <title>BiSSL: A Bilevel Optimization Framework for Enhancing the Alignment Between Self-Supervised Pre-Training and Downstream Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents BiSSL, a novel training framework that utilizes bilevel optimization to enhance the alignment between the pretext pre-training and downstream fine-tuning stages in self-supervised learning. BiSSL formulates the pretext and downstream task objectives as the lower- and upper-level objectives in a bilevel optimization problem and serves as an intermediate training stage within the self-supervised learning pipeline. By explicitly modeling the interdependence of these training stages, BiSSL facilitates enhanced information sharing between them, ultimately leading to a backbone parameter initialization that is better aligned for the downstream task. We propose a versatile training algorithm that alternates between optimizing the two objectives defined in BiSSL, which is applicable to a broad range of pretext and downstream tasks. Using SimCLR and Bootstrap Your Own Latent to pre-train ResNet-50 backbones on the ImageNet dataset, we demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms the conventional self-supervised learning pipeline on the vast majority of 12 downstream image classification datasets, as well as on object detection. Visualizations of the backbone features provide further evidence that BiSSL improves the downstream task alignment of the backbone features prior to fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>FAN: Fourier Analysis Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable successes of general-purpose neural networks, such as MLPs and Transformers, we find that they exhibit notable shortcomings in modeling and reasoning about periodic phenomena, achieving only marginal performance within the training domain and failing to generalize effectively to out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios. Periodicity is ubiquitous throughout nature and science. Therefore, neural networks should be equipped with the essential ability to model and handle periodicity. In this work, we propose FAN, a novel general-purpose neural network that offers broad applicability similar to MLP while effectively addressing periodicity modeling challenges. Periodicity is naturally integrated into FAN's structure and computational processes by introducing the Fourier Principle. Unlike existing Fourier-based networks, which possess particular periodicity modeling abilities but are typically designed for specific tasks, our approach maintains the general-purpose modeling capability. Therefore, FAN can seamlessly replace MLP in various model architectures with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of FAN in periodicity modeling tasks and the effectiveness and generalizability of FAN across a range of real-world tasks, e.g., symbolic formula representation, time series forecasting, language modeling, and image recognition.</description>

      <title>LANTERN: Accelerating Visual Autoregressive Models with Relaxed Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Auto-Regressive (AR) models have recently gained prominence in image generation, often matching or even surpassing the performance of diffusion models. However, one major limitation of AR models is their sequential nature, which processes tokens one at a time, slowing down generation compared to models like GANs or diffusion-based methods that operate more efficiently. While speculative decoding has proven effective for accelerating LLMs by generating multiple tokens in a single forward, its application in visual AR models remains largely unexplored. In this work, we identify a challenge in this setting, which we term \textit{token selection ambiguity}, wherein visual AR models frequently assign uniformly low probabilities to tokens, hampering the performance of speculative decoding. To overcome this challenge, we propose a relaxed acceptance condition referred to as LANTERN that leverages the interchangeability of tokens in latent space. This relaxation restores the effectiveness of speculative decoding in visual AR models by enabling more flexible use of candidate tokens that would otherwise be prematurely rejected. Furthermore, by incorporating a total variation distance bound, we ensure that these speed gains are achieved without significantly compromising image quality or semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method in providing a substantial speed-up over speculative decoding. In specific, compared to a na\"ive application of the state-of-the-art speculative decoding, LANTERN increases speed-ups by $\mathbf{1.75}\times$ and $\mathbf{1.82}\times$, as compared to greedy decoding and random sampling, respectively, when applied to LlamaGen, a contemporary visual AR model.</description>

      <title>"Cold, Calculated, and Condescending": How AI Identifies and Explains Ableism Compared to Disabled People</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People with disabilities (PwD) regularly encounter ableist hate and microaggressions online. These spaces are generally moderated by machine learning models, but little is known about how effectively AI models identify ableist speech and how well their judgments align with PwD. To investigate this, we curated a first-of-its-kind dataset of 200 social media comments targeted towards PwD, and prompted state-of-the art AI models (i.e., Toxicity Classifiers, LLMs) to score toxicity and ableism for each comment, and explain their reasoning. Then, we recruited 190 participants to similarly rate and explain the harm, and evaluate LLM explanations. Our mixed-methods analysis highlighted a major disconnect: AI underestimated toxicity compared to PwD ratings, while its ableism assessments were sporadic and varied. Although LLMs identified some biases, its explanations were flawed--they lacked nuance, made incorrect assumptions, and appeared judgmental instead of educational. Going forward, we discuss challenges and opportunities in designing moderation systems for ableism, and advocate for the involvement of intersectional disabled perspectives in AI.</description>

      <title>Last Iterate Convergence in Monotone Mean Field Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mean Field Game (MFG) is a framework for modeling and approximating the behavior of large numbers of agents. Computing equilibria in MFG has been of interest in multi-agent reinforcement learning. The theoretical guarantee that the last updated policy converges to an equilibrium has been limited. We propose the use of a simple, proximal-point (PP) type method to compute equilibria for MFGs. We then provide the first last-iterate convergence (LIC) guarantee under the Lasry--Lions-type monotonicity condition. We also propose an approximation of the update rule of PP ($\mathtt{APP}$) based on the observation that it is equivalent to solving the regularized MFG, which can be solved by mirror descent. We further establish that the regularized mirror descent achieves LIC at an exponential rate. Our numerical experiment demonstrates that $\mathtt{APP}$ efficiently computes the equilibrium.</description>

      <title>LLMs Are In-Context Bandit Reinforcement Learners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning (ICL), a supervised learning technique that relies on adding annotated examples to the model context. We investigate a contextual bandit version of in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL), where models learn in-context, online, from external reward, instead of supervised data. We show that LLMs effectively demonstrate such learning, and provide a detailed study of the phenomena, experimenting with challenging classification tasks and models of sizes from 500M to 70B parameters. This includes identifying and addressing the instability of the process, demonstrating learning with both semantic and abstract labels, and showing scaling trends. Our findings highlight ICRL capabilities in LLMs, while also underscoring fundamental limitations in their implicit reasoning about errors.</description>

      <title>On the Expressiveness of Multi-Neuron Convex Relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To provide robustness guarantees, neural network certification methods heavily rely on convex relaxations. The imprecision of these convex relaxations, however, is a major obstacle: even the most precise single-neuron relaxation is incomplete for general ReLU networks, a phenomenon referred to as the single-neuron convex barrier. While heuristic instantiations of multi-neuron relaxations have been proposed to circumvent this barrier in practice, their theoretical properties remain largely unknown. In this work, we conduct the first rigorous study of the expressiveness of multi-neuron relaxations. We first show that the ``$\max$'' function in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be encoded by a ReLU network and exactly bounded by a multi-neuron relaxation, which is impossible for any single-neuron relaxation. Further, we prove that multi-neuron relaxations can be turned into complete verifiers by semantic-preserving structural transformations or by input space partitioning that enjoys improved worst-case partition complexity. We also show that without these augmentations, the completeness guarantee can no longer be obtained, and the relaxation error of every multi-neuron relaxation can be unbounded. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide an extensive characterization of multi-neuron relaxations and their expressiveness in neural network certification.</description>

      <title>Understanding Model Ensemble in Transferable Adversarial Attack</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model ensemble adversarial attack has become a powerful method for generating transferable adversarial examples that can target even unknown models, but its theoretical foundation remains underexplored. To address this gap, we provide early theoretical insights that serve as a roadmap for advancing model ensemble adversarial attack. We first define transferability error to measure the error in adversarial transferability, alongside concepts of diversity and empirical model ensemble Rademacher complexity. We then decompose the transferability error into vulnerability, diversity, and a constant, which rigidly explains the origin of transferability error in model ensemble attack: the vulnerability of an adversarial example to ensemble components, and the diversity of ensemble components. Furthermore, we apply the latest mathematical tools in information theory to bound the transferability error using complexity and generalization terms, contributing to three practical guidelines for reducing transferability error: (1) incorporating more surrogate models, (2) increasing their diversity, and (3) reducing their complexity in cases of overfitting. Finally, extensive experiments with 54 models validate our theoretical framework, representing a significant step forward in understanding transferable model ensemble adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Sparse Autoencoders Reveal Universal Feature Spaces Across Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate feature universality in large language models (LLMs), a research field that aims to understand how different models similarly represent concepts in the latent spaces of their intermediate layers. Demonstrating feature universality allows discoveries about latent representations to generalize across several models. However, comparing features across LLMs is challenging due to polysemanticity, in which individual neurons often correspond to multiple features rather than distinct ones, making it difficult to disentangle and match features across different models. To address this issue, we employ a method known as dictionary learning by using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to transform LLM activations into more interpretable spaces spanned by neurons corresponding to individual features. After matching feature neurons across models via activation correlation, we apply representational space similarity metrics on SAE feature spaces across different LLMs. Our experiments reveal significant similarities in SAE feature spaces across various LLMs, providing new evidence for feature universality.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalisable Time Series Understanding Across Domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in natural language processing and computer vision, driven by efficient pre-training on large datasets, have enabled foundation models to excel on a wide range of tasks. However, this potential has not yet been fully realised in time series analysis, as existing methods fail to address the heterogeneity in large time series corpora. Prevalent in domains ranging from medicine to finance, time series vary substantially in characteristics such as variate count, inter-variate relationships, temporal patterns, and sampling frequency. To address this, we introduce a novel pre-training paradigm specifically designed to handle time series heterogeneity. We propose a tokeniser with learnable domain signatures, a dual masking strategy, and a normalised cross-correlation loss, enabling our open model for general time series analysis (OTiS) to efficiently learn from large time series corpora. Extensive benchmarking on diverse tasks, such as classification, regression, and forecasting, demonstrates that OTiS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our code and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/oetu/otis.</description>

      <title>Drama: Mamba-Enabled Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Is Sample and Parameter Efficient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution to the data inefficiency that plagues most model-free RL algorithms. However, learning a robust world model often demands complex and deep architectures, which are expensive to compute and train. Within the world model, dynamics models are particularly crucial for accurate predictions, and various dynamics-model architectures have been explored, each with its own set of challenges. Currently, recurrent neural network (RNN) based world models face issues such as vanishing gradients and difficulty in capturing long-term dependencies effectively. In contrast, use of transformers suffers from the well-known issues of self-attention mechanisms, where both memory and computational complexity scale as $O(n^2)$, with $n$ representing the sequence length.
  To address these challenges we propose a state space model (SSM) based world model, specifically based on Mamba, that achieves $O(n)$ memory and computational complexity while effectively capturing long-term dependencies and facilitating the use of longer training sequences efficiently. We also introduce a novel sampling method to mitigate the suboptimality caused by an incorrect world model in the early stages of training, combining it with the aforementioned technique to achieve a normalised score comparable to other state-of-the-art model-based RL algorithms using only a 7 million trainable parameter world model. This model is accessible and can be trained on an off-the-shelf laptop. Our code is available at https://github.com/realwenlongwang/Drama.git</description>

      <title>Position: On-Premises LLM Deployment Demands a Middle Path: Preserving Privacy Without Sacrificing Model Confidentiality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current LLM customization typically relies on two deployment strategies: closed-source APIs, which require users to upload private data to external servers, and open-weight models, which allow local fine-tuning but pose misuse risks. In this position paper, we argue that (1) deploying closed-source LLMs within user-controlled infrastructure (\textit{on-premises deployment}) enhances data privacy and mitigates misuse risks, and (2) a well-designed on-premises deployment must ensure model confidentiality -- by preventing model theft -- and offer privacy-preserving customization. Prior research on small models has explored securing only the output layer within hardware-secured devices to balance confidentiality and customization efficiency. However, we show that this approach is insufficient for defending large-scale LLMs against distillation attacks. We therefore introduce a {semi-open deployment framework} that secures only a few, carefully chosen layers, achieving distillation resistance comparable to fully secured models while preserving fine-tuning flexibility. Through extensive experiments, we show that securing bottom layers significantly reduces functional extraction risks. Our findings demonstrate that privacy and confidentiality can coexist, paving the way for secure on-premises AI deployment that balances usability and protection.</description>

      <title>In-context learning and Occam's razor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central goal of machine learning is generalization. While the No Free Lunch Theorem states that we cannot obtain theoretical guarantees for generalization without further assumptions, in practice we observe that simple models which explain the training data generalize best: a principle called Occam's razor. Despite the need for simple models, most current approaches in machine learning only minimize the training error, and at best indirectly promote simplicity through regularization or architecture design. Here, we draw a connection between Occam's razor and in-context learning: an emergent ability of certain sequence models like Transformers to learn at inference time from past observations in a sequence. In particular, we show that the next-token prediction loss used to train in-context learners is directly equivalent to a data compression technique called prequential coding, and that minimizing this loss amounts to jointly minimizing both the training error and the complexity of the model that was implicitly learned from context. Our theory and the empirical experiments we use to support it not only provide a normative account of in-context learning, but also elucidate the shortcomings of current in-context learning methods, suggesting ways in which they can be improved. We make our code available at https://github.com/3rdCore/PrequentialCode.</description>

      <title>A Complexity-Based Theory of Compositionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compositionality is believed to be fundamental to intelligence. In humans, it underlies the structure of thought, language, and higher-level reasoning. In AI, compositional representations can enable a powerful form of out-of-distribution generalization, in which a model systematically adapts to novel combinations of known concepts. However, while we have strong intuitions about what compositionality is, there currently exists no formal definition for it that is measurable and mathematical. Here, we propose such a definition, which we call representational compositionality, that accounts for and extends our intuitions about compositionality. The definition is conceptually simple, quantitative, grounded in algorithmic information theory, and applicable to any representation. Intuitively, representational compositionality states that a compositional representation satisfies three properties. First, it must be expressive. Second, it must be possible to re-describe the representation as a function of discrete symbolic sequences with re-combinable parts, analogous to sentences in natural language. Third, the function that relates these symbolic sequences to the representation, analogous to semantics in natural language, must be simple. Through experiments on both synthetic and real world data, we validate our definition of compositionality and show how it unifies disparate intuitions from across the literature in both AI and cognitive science. We also show that representational compositionality, while theoretically intractable, can be readily estimated using standard deep learning tools. Our definition has the potential to inspire the design of novel, theoretically-driven models that better capture the mechanisms of compositional thought.</description>

      <title>Improving Parallel Program Performance with LLM Optimizers via Agent-System Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern scientific discovery increasingly relies on high-performance computing for complex modeling and simulation. A key challenge in improving parallel program performance is efficiently mapping tasks to processors and data to memory, a process dictated by intricate, low-level system code known as mappers. Developing high-performance mappers demands days of manual tuning, posing a significant barrier for domain scientists without systems expertise. We introduce a framework that automates mapper development with generative optimization, leveraging richer feedback beyond scalar performance metrics. Our approach features the Agent-System Interface, which includes a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to abstract away low-level complexity of system code and define a structured search space, as well as AutoGuide, a mechanism that interprets raw execution output into actionable feedback. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning methods such as OpenTuner, which rely solely on scalar feedback, our method finds superior mappers in far fewer iterations. With just 10 iterations, it outperforms OpenTuner even after 1000 iterations, achieving 3.8X faster performance. Our approach finds mappers that surpass expert-written mappers by up to 1.34X speedup across nine benchmarks while reducing tuning time from days to minutes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine-assisted theorem proving refers to the process of conducting structured reasoning to automatically generate proofs for mathematical theorems. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in using machine learning models in conjunction with proof assistants to perform this task. In this paper, we introduce Pantograph, a tool that provides a versatile interface to the Lean 4 proof assistant and enables efficient proof search via powerful search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search. In addition, Pantograph enables high-level reasoning by enabling a more robust handling of Lean 4's inference steps. We provide an overview of Pantograph's architecture and features. We also report on an illustrative use case: using machine learning models and proof sketches to prove Lean 4 theorems. Pantograph's innovative features pave the way for more advanced machine learning models to perform complex proof searches and high-level reasoning, equipping future researchers to design more versatile and powerful theorem provers.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the new concept of an Arabic Derivational Chain Bank CHAINBANK to leverage the relationship between form and meaning in modeling Arabic derivational morphology. We constructed a knowledge graph network of abstract patterns and their derivational relations and aligned it with the lemmas of the CAMELMORPH morphological analyzer database. This process produced chains of derived words' lemmas linked to their corresponding lemma bases through derivational relations, encompassing 23,333 derivational connections.</description>

      <title>Birdie: Advancing State Space Models with Reward-Driven Objectives and Curricula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01030v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient state space models (SSMs), such as linear recurrent neural networks and linear attention variants, offer computational advantages over Transformers but struggle with tasks requiring long-range in-context retrieval-like text copying, associative recall, and question answering over long contexts. Previous efforts to address these challenges have focused on architectural modifications, often reintroducing computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose a novel training procedure, Birdie, that significantly enhances the in-context retrieval capabilities of SSMs without altering their architecture. Our approach combines bidirectional input processing with dynamic mixtures of specialized pre-training objectives, optimized via reinforcement learning. We introduce a new bidirectional SSM architecture that seamlessly transitions from bidirectional context processing to causal generation. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Birdie markedly improves performance on retrieval-intensive tasks such as multi-number phone book lookup, long paragraph question-answering, and infilling. This narrows the performance gap with Transformers, while retaining computational efficiency. Our findings highlight the importance of training procedures in leveraging the fixed-state capacity of SSMs, offering a new direction to advance their capabilities. All code and pre-trained models are available at https://www.github.com/samblouir/birdie, with support for JAX and PyTorch.</description>

      <title>Privacy Leakage Overshadowed by Views of AI: A Study on Human Oversight of Privacy in Language Model Agent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language model (LM) agents that act on users' behalf for personal tasks (e.g., replying emails) can boost productivity, but are also susceptible to unintended privacy leakage risks. We present the first study on people's capacity to oversee the privacy implications of the LM agents. By conducting a task-based survey (N=300), we investigate how people react to and assess the response generated by LM agents for asynchronous interpersonal communication tasks, compared with a response they wrote. We found that people may favor the agent response with more privacy leakage over the response they drafted or consider both good, leading to an increased harmful disclosure from 15.7% to 55.0%. We further identified six privacy profiles to characterize distinct patterns of concerns, trust, and privacy preferences in LM agents. Our findings shed light on designing agentic systems that enable privacy-preserving interactions and achieve bidirectional alignment on privacy preferences to help users calibrate trust.</description>

      <title>UniGuard: Towards Universal Safety Guardrails for Jailbreak Attacks on Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have revolutionized vision-language understanding but remain vulnerable to multimodal jailbreak attacks, where adversarial inputs are meticulously crafted to elicit harmful or inappropriate responses. We propose UniGuard, a novel multimodal safety guardrail that jointly considers the unimodal and cross-modal harmful signals. UniGuard trains a multimodal guardrail to minimize the likelihood of generating harmful responses in a toxic corpus. The guardrail can be seamlessly applied to any input prompt during inference with minimal computational costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalizability of UniGuard across multiple modalities, attack strategies, and multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs, including LLaVA, Gemini Pro, GPT-4o, MiniGPT-4, and InstructBLIP. Notably, this robust defense mechanism maintains the models' overall vision-language understanding capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AdamW has been the default optimizer for transformer pretraining. For many years, our community searched for faster and more stable optimizers with only constrained positive outcomes. In this work, we propose a single-line modification in Pytorch to any momentum-based optimizer, which we rename cautious optimizer, e.g. C-AdamW and C-Lion. Our theoretical result shows that this modification preserves Adam's Hamiltonian function and it does not break the convergence guarantee under the Lyapunov analysis. In addition, a whole new family of optimizers is revealed by our theoretical insight. Among them, we pick the simplest one for empirical experiments, showing not only speed-up on Llama and MAE pretraining up to $1.47$ times, but also better results in LLM post-training tasks.

      <title>CLOVER: Cross-Layer Orthogonal Vectors Pruning and Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17426v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoder-only models generate tokens autoregressively by caching key/value vectors, but as the cache grows, inference becomes memory-bound. To address this issue, we introduce CLOVER (Cross-Layer Orthogonal Vectors), a novel approach that treats pairs of attention layers as a set of low-rank decompositions. CLOVER applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to the \( Q \)-\( K \) and \( V \)-\( O \) pairs within each attention head. The resulting singular values can either guide pruning or serve as trainable parameters for efficient fine-tuning of all orthogonal vectors. After pruning or fine-tuning, these values are reintegrated into the model without increasing its parameter count. We apply CLOVER to various models, including GPT-2 XL, DeepSeek-V2-Lite, Whisper-Large-v3, Stable Diffusion XL, and LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision. Our results demonstrate that CLOVER significantly improves pruning efficiency. For instance, the perplexity of pruning 70\% of the \( Q \)-\( K \) pairs in GPT-2 XL is similar to that of pruning just 8\% with vanilla methods. Fine-tuning the singular values further results in a full-rank update, outperforming state-of-the-art methods (LoRA, DoRA, HiRA, and PiSSA) by 7.6\%, 5.5\%, 3.8\%, and 0.7\%, respectively, on eight commonsense tasks for LLaMA-2 7B.</description>

      <title>Supervised Learning-enhanced Multi-Group Actor Critic for Live Stream Allocation in Feed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10381v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of a short video &amp; live stream mixed recommendation scenario, the live stream recommendation system (RS) decides whether to allocate at most one live stream into the video feed for each user request. To maximize long-term user engagement, it is crucial to determine an optimal live stream policy for accurate live stream allocation. The inappropriate live stream allocation policy can significantly affect the duration of the usage app and user retention, which ignores the long-term negative impact of live stream allocation. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely applied in recommendation systems to capture long-term user engagement. However, traditional RL algorithms often face divergence and instability problems, which restricts the application and deployment in the large-scale industrial recommendation systems, especially in the aforementioned challenging scenario. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Supervised Learning-enhanced Multi-Group Actor Critic algorithm (SL-MGAC). Specifically, we introduce a supervised learning-enhanced actor-critic framework that incorporates variance reduction techniques, where multi-task reward learning helps restrict bootstrapping error accumulation during critic learning. Additionally, we design a multi-group state decomposition module for both actor and critic networks to reduce prediction variance and improve model stability. We also propose a novel reward function to prevent overly greedy live stream allocation. Empirically, we evaluate the SL-MGAC algorithm using offline policy evaluation (OPE) and online A/B testing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms baseline methods under the platform-level constraints but also exhibits enhanced stability in online recommendation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Wearable Accelerometer Foundation Models for Health via Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern wearable devices can conveniently record various biosignals in the many different environments of daily living, enabling a rich view of individual health. However, not all biosignals are the same: high-fidelity biosignals, such as photoplethysmogram (PPG), contain more physiological information, but require optical sensors with a high power footprint. Alternatively, a lower-fidelity biosignal such as accelerometry has a significantly smaller power footprint and is available in almost any wearable device. While accelerometry is widely used for activity recognition and fitness, it is less explored for health biomarkers and diagnosis. Here, we show that an accelerometry foundation model can predict a wide variety of health targets. To achieve improved performance, we distill representational knowledge from PPG encoders to accelerometery encoders using 20 million minutes of unlabeled data, collected from ~172K participants in the Apple Heart and Movement Study under informed consent. We observe strong cross-modal alignment on unseen data, e.g., 99.2% top-1 accuracy for retrieving PPG embeddings from accelerometry embeddings. We show that distilled accelerometry encoders have significantly more informative representations compared to self-supervised or supervised encoders trained directly on accelerometry data, observed by at least 23%-49% improved performance for predicting heart rate and heart rate variability. We also show that distilled accelerometry encoders are readily predictive of a wide array of downstream health targets, i.e., they are generalist foundation models. We believe accelerometry foundation models for health may unlock new opportunities for developing digital biomarkers from any wearable device.</description>

      <title>ReXTrust: A Model for Fine-Grained Hallucination Detection in AI-Generated Radiology Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15264v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of AI-generated radiology reports necessitates robust methods for detecting hallucinations--false or unfounded statements that could impact patient care. We present ReXTrust, a novel framework for fine-grained hallucination detection in AI-generated radiology reports. Our approach leverages sequences of hidden states from large vision-language models to produce finding-level hallucination risk scores. We evaluate ReXTrust on a subset of the MIMIC-CXR dataset and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing approaches, achieving an AUROC of 0.8751 across all findings and 0.8963 on clinically significant findings. Our results show that white-box approaches leveraging model hidden states can provide reliable hallucination detection for medical AI systems, potentially improving the safety and reliability of automated radiology reporting.</description>

      <title>Towards Graph Foundation Models: Learning Generalities Across Graphs via Task-Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models aim to create general, cross-task, and cross-domain machine learning models by pretraining on large-scale datasets to capture shared patterns or concepts, such as contours, colors, textures, and edges in images, or tokens, words, and sentences in text. However, identifying generalities across graph-structured data remains a significant challenge, as different graph-based tasks necessitate distinct inductive biases, thereby impeding the development of graph foundation models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach for learning cross-task generalities in graphs. Specifically, we propose task-trees as basic learning instances to align task spaces (node, link, graph) on graphs. Then, we conduct a theoretical analysis to examine their stability, transferability, and generalization. Our findings indicate that when a graph neural network (GNN) is pretrained on diverse task-trees using a reconstruction objective, it acquires transferable knowledge, enabling effective adaptation to downstream tasks with an appropriate set of fine-tuning samples. To empirically validate this approach, we develop a pretrained graph model based on task-trees, termed Graph Generality Identifier on Task-Trees (GIT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that a single pretrained GIT model can be effectively adapted to over 30 different graphs across five domains via fine-tuning, in-context learning, or zero-shot learning. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/GIT.</description>

      <title>CORAL: Concept Drift Representation Learning for Co-evolving Time-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of time series analysis, tackling the phenomenon of concept drift poses a significant challenge. Concept drift -- characterized by the evolving statistical properties of time series data, affects the reliability and accuracy of conventional analysis models. This is particularly evident in co-evolving scenarios where interactions among variables are crucial. This paper presents CORAL, a simple yet effective method that models time series as an evolving ecosystem to learn representations of concept drift. CORAL employs a kernel-induced self-representation learning to generate a representation matrix, encapsulating the inherent dynamics of co-evolving time series. This matrix serves as a key tool for identification and adaptation to concept drift by observing its temporal variations. Furthermore, CORAL effectively identifies prevailing patterns and offers insights into emerging trends through pattern evolution analysis. Our empirical evaluation of CORAL across various datasets demonstrates its effectiveness in handling the complexities of concept drift. This approach introduces a novel perspective in the theoretical domain of co-evolving time series analysis, enhancing adaptability and accuracy in the face of dynamic data environments, and can be easily integrated into most deep learning backbones.</description>

      <title>Model Alignment Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When can we say that two neural systems are the same? The answer to this question is goal-dependent, and it is often addressed through correlative methods such as Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) and Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). How do we target functionally relevant similarity, and how do we isolate specific causal aspects of the representations? In this work, we introduce Model Alignment Search (MAS), a method for causally exploring distributed representational similarity. The method learns invertible linear transformations that align a subspace between two distributed networks' representations where causal information can be freely interchanged. We first show that the method can be used to transfer values of specific causal variables -- such as the number of items in a counting task -- between networks with different training seeds. We then explore open questions in number cognition by comparing different types of numeric representations in models trained on structurally different tasks. We then explore differences between MAS vs preexisting causal similarity methods, and lastly, we introduce a counterfactual latent auxiliary loss function that helps shape causally relevant alignments even in cases where we do not have causal access to one of the two models for training.</description>

      <title>Polarized Patterns of Language Toxicity and Sentiment of Debunking Posts on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of misinformation and fake news in online political discourse poses significant challenges to democratic processes and public engagement. While debunking efforts aim to counteract misinformation and foster fact-based dialogue, these discussions often involve language toxicity and emotional polarization. We examined over 86 million debunking tweets and more than 4 million Reddit debunking comments to investigate the relationship between language toxicity, pessimism, and social polarization in debunking efforts. Focusing on discussions of the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections and the QAnon conspiracy theory, our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) peripheral participants (1-degree users) play a disproportionate role in shaping toxic discourse, driven by lower community accountability and emotional expression; (2) platform mechanisms significantly influence polarization, with Twitter amplifying partisan differences and Reddit fostering higher overall toxicity due to its structured, community-driven interactions; and (3) a negative correlation exists between language toxicity and pessimism, with increased interaction reducing toxicity, especially on Reddit. We show that platform architecture affects informational complexity of user interactions, with Twitter promoting concentrated, uniform discourse and Reddit encouraging diverse, complex communication. Our findings highlight the importance of user engagement patterns, platform dynamics, and emotional expressions in shaping polarization in debunking discourse. This study offers insights for policymakers and platform designers to mitigate harmful effects and promote healthier online discussions, with implications for understanding misinformation, hate speech, and political polarization in digital environments.</description>

      <title>Addressing Quality Challenges in Deep Learning: The Role of MLOps and Domain Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) systems present unique challenges in software engineering, especially concerning quality attributes like correctness and resource efficiency. While DL models excel in specific tasks, engineering DL systems is still essential. The effort, cost, and potential diminishing returns of continual improvements must be carefully evaluated, as software engineers often face the critical decision of when to stop refining a system relative to its quality attributes. This experience paper explores the role of MLOps practices -- such as monitoring and experiment tracking -- in creating transparent and reproducible experimentation environments that enable teams to assess and justify the impact of design decisions on quality attributes. Furthermore, we report on experiences addressing the quality challenges by embedding domain knowledge into the design of a DL model and its integration within a larger system. The findings offer actionable insights into the benefits of domain knowledge and MLOps and the strategic consideration of when to limit further optimizations in DL projects to maximize overall system quality and reliability.</description>

      <title>Dual Debiasing: Remove Stereotypes and Keep Factual Gender for Fair Language Modeling and Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mitigation of biases, such as language models' reliance on gender stereotypes, is a crucial endeavor required for the creation of reliable and useful language technology. The crucial aspect of debiasing is to ensure that the models preserve their versatile capabilities, including their ability to solve language tasks and equitably represent various genders. To address this issue, we introduce a streamlined Dual Dabiasing Algorithm through Model Adaptation (2DAMA). Novel Dual Debiasing enables robust reduction of stereotypical bias while preserving desired factual gender information encoded by language models. We show that 2DAMA effectively reduces gender bias in English and is one of the first approaches facilitating the mitigation of stereotypical tendencies in translation. The proposed method's key advantage is the preservation of factual gender cues, which are useful in a wide range of natural language processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Concurrent Learning with Aggregated States via Randomized Least Squares Value Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing learning agents that explore efficiently in a complex environment has been widely recognized as a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning. While a number of works have demonstrated the effectiveness of techniques based on randomized value functions on a single agent, it remains unclear, from a theoretical point of view, whether injecting randomization can help a society of agents {\it concurently} explore an environment. The theoretical results %that we established in this work tender an affirmative answer to this question. We adapt the concurrent learning framework to \textit{randomized least-squares value iteration} (RLSVI) with \textit{aggregated state representation}. We demonstrate polynomial worst-case regret bounds in both finite- and infinite-horizon environments. In both setups the per-agent regret decreases at an optimal rate of $\Theta\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\right)$, highlighting the advantage of concurent learning. Our algorithm exhibits significantly lower space complexity compared to \cite{russo2019worst} and \cite{agrawal2021improved}. We reduce the space complexity by a factor of $K$ while incurring only a $\sqrt{K}$ increase in the worst-case regret bound, compared to \citep{agrawal2021improved,russo2019worst}. Additionally, we conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Framework for Semantic Similarity Analysis of Human and AI-Generated Text Using Transformer Architectures and Ensemble Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has made detecting AI-generated text an increasingly critical challenge. Traditional methods often fail to capture the nuanced semantic differences between human and machine-generated content. We therefore propose a novel approach based on semantic similarity analysis, leveraging a multi-layered architecture that combines a pre-trained DeBERTa-v3-large model, Bi-directional LSTMs, and linear attention pooling to capture both local and global semantic patterns. To enhance performance, we employ advanced input and output augmentation techniques such as sector-level context integration and wide output configurations. These techniques enable the model to learn more discriminative features and generalize across diverse domains. Experimental results show that this approach works better than traditional methods, proving its usefulness for AI-generated text detection and other text comparison tasks.</description>

      <title>SpatialVLA: Exploring Spatial Representations for Visual-Language-Action Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we claim that spatial understanding is the keypoint in robot manipulation, and propose SpatialVLA to explore effective spatial representations for the robot foundation model. Specifically, we introduce Ego3D Position Encoding to inject 3D information into the input observations of the visual-language-action model, and propose Adaptive Action Grids to represent spatial robot movement actions with adaptive discretized action grids, facilitating learning generalizable and transferrable spatial action knowledge for cross-robot control. SpatialVLA is first pre-trained on top of a vision-language model with 1.1 Million real-world robot episodes, to learn a generalist manipulation policy across multiple robot environments and tasks. After pre-training, SpatialVLA is directly applied to perform numerous tasks in a zero-shot manner. The superior results in both simulation and real-world robots demonstrate its advantage of inferring complex robot motion trajectories and its strong in-domain multi-task generalization ability. We further show the proposed Adaptive Action Grids offer a new and effective way to fine-tune the pre-trained SpatialVLA model for new simulation and real-world setups, where the pre-learned action grids are re-discretized to capture robot-specific spatial action movements of new setups. The superior results from extensive evaluations demonstrate the exceptional in-distribution generalization and out-of-distribution adaptation capability, highlighting the crucial benefit of the proposed spatial-aware representations for generalist robot policy learning. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Automated Detection of Sport Highlights from Audio and Video Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel Deep Learning-based and lightweight approach for the automated detection of sports highlights (HLs) from audio and video sources. HL detection is a key task in sports video analysis, traditionally requiring significant human effort. Our solution leverages Deep Learning (DL) models trained on relatively small datasets of audio Mel-spectrograms and grayscale video frames, achieving promising accuracy rates of 89% and 83% for audio and video detection, respectively. The use of small datasets, combined with simple architectures, demonstrates the practicality of our method for fast and cost-effective deployment. Furthermore, an ensemble model combining both modalities shows improved robustness against false positives and false negatives. The proposed methodology offers a scalable solution for automated HL detection across various types of sports video content, reducing the need for manual intervention. Future work will focus on enhancing model architectures and extending this approach to broader scene-detection tasks in media analysis.</description>

      <title>Anatomy Might Be All You Need: Forecasting What to Do During Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surgical guidance can be delivered in various ways. In neurosurgery, spatial guidance and orientation are predominantly achieved through neuronavigation systems that reference pre-operative MRI scans. Recently, there has been growing interest in providing live guidance by analyzing video feeds from tools such as endoscopes. Existing approaches, including anatomy detection, orientation feedback, phase recognition, and visual question-answering, primarily focus on aiding surgeons in assessing the current surgical scene. This work aims to provide guidance on a finer scale, aiming to provide guidance by forecasting the trajectory of the surgical instrument, essentially addressing the question of what to do next. To address this task, we propose a model that not only leverages the historical locations of surgical instruments but also integrates anatomical features. Importantly, our work does not rely on explicit ground truth labels for instrument trajectories. Instead, the ground truth is generated by a detection model trained to detect both anatomical structures and instruments within surgical videos of a comprehensive dataset containing pituitary surgery videos. By analyzing the interaction between anatomy and instrument movements in these videos and forecasting future instrument movements, we show that anatomical features are a valuable asset in addressing this challenging task. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to address this task for manually operated surgeries.</description>

      <title>SAeUron: Interpretable Concept Unlearning in Diffusion Models with Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models, while powerful, can inadvertently generate harmful or undesirable content, raising significant ethical and safety concerns. Recent machine unlearning approaches offer potential solutions but often lack transparency, making it difficult to understand the changes they introduce to the base model. In this work, we introduce SAeUron, a novel method leveraging features learned by sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to remove unwanted concepts in text-to-image diffusion models. First, we demonstrate that SAEs, trained in an unsupervised manner on activations from multiple denoising timesteps of the diffusion model, capture sparse and interpretable features corresponding to specific concepts. Building on this, we propose a feature selection method that enables precise interventions on model activations to block targeted content while preserving overall performance. Evaluation with the competitive UnlearnCanvas benchmark on object and style unlearning highlights SAeUron's state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, we show that with a single SAE, we can remove multiple concepts simultaneously and that in contrast to other methods, SAeUron mitigates the possibility of generating unwanted content, even under adversarial attack. Code and checkpoints are available at: https://github.com/cywinski/SAeUron.</description>

      <title>o3-mini vs DeepSeek-R1: Which One is Safer?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The irruption of DeepSeek-R1 constitutes a turning point for the AI industry in general and the LLMs in particular. Its capabilities have demonstrated outstanding performance in several tasks, including creative thinking, code generation, maths and automated program repair, at apparently lower execution cost. However, LLMs must adhere to an important qualitative property, i.e., their alignment with safety and human values. A clear competitor of DeepSeek-R1 is its American counterpart, OpenAI's o3-mini model, which is expected to set high standards in terms of performance, safety and cost. In this technical report, we systematically assess the safety level of both DeepSeek-R1 (70b version) and OpenAI's o3-mini (beta version). To this end, we make use of our recently released automated safety testing tool, named ASTRAL. By leveraging this tool, we automatically and systematically generated and executed 1,260 test inputs on both models. After conducting a semi-automated assessment of the outcomes provided by both LLMs, the results indicate that DeepSeek-R1 produces significantly more unsafe responses (12%) than OpenAI's o3-mini (1.2%).</description>
