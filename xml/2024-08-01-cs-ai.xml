      <title>Causal Understanding For Video Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Question Answering is a challenging task, which requires the model to reason over multiple frames and understand the interaction between different objects to answer questions based on the context provided within the video, especially in datasets like NExT-QA (Xiao et al., 2021a) which emphasize on causal and temporal questions. Previous approaches leverage either sub-sampled information or causal intervention techniques along with complete video features to tackle the NExT-QA task. In this work we elicit the limitations of these approaches and propose solutions along four novel directions of improvements on theNExT-QA dataset. Our approaches attempts to compensate for the shortcomings in the previous works by systematically attacking each of these problems by smartly sampling frames, explicitly encoding actions and creating interventions that challenge the understanding of the model. Overall, for both single-frame (+6.3%) and complete-video (+1.1%) based approaches, we obtain the state-of-the-art results on NExT-QA dataset.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference Using Material Point Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new gradient-based particle sampling method, MPM-ParVI, based on material point method (MPM), is proposed for variational inference. MPM-ParVI simulates the deformation of a deformable body (e.g. a solid or fluid) under external effects driven by the target density; transient or steady configuration of the deformable body approximates the target density. The continuum material is modelled as an interacting particle system (IPS) using MPM, each particle carries full physical properties, interacts and evolves following conservation dynamics. This easy-to-implement ParVI method offers deterministic sampling and inference for a class of probabilistic models such as those encountered in Bayesian inference (e.g. intractable densities) and generative modelling (e.g. score-based).</description>

      <title>Physics of Language Models: Part 2.1, Grade-School Math and the Hidden Reasoning Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in language models have demonstrated their capability to solve mathematical reasoning problems, achieving near-perfect accuracy on grade-school level math benchmarks like GSM8K. In this paper, we formally study how language models solve these problems. We design a series of controlled experiments to address several fundamental questions: (1) Can language models truly develop reasoning skills, or do they simply memorize templates? (2) What is the model's hidden (mental) reasoning process? (3) Do models solve math questions using skills similar to or different from humans? (4) Do models trained on GSM8K-like datasets develop reasoning skills beyond those necessary for solving GSM8K problems? (5) What mental process causes models to make reasoning mistakes? (6) How large or deep must a model be to effectively solve GSM8K-level math questions?
  Our study uncovers many hidden mechanisms by which language models solve mathematical questions, providing insights that extend beyond current understandings of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models for automatic analysis of teacher simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital Simulations (DS) provide safe environments where users interact with an agent through conversational prompts, providing engaging learning experiences that can be used to train teacher candidates in realistic classroom scenarios. These simulations usually include open-ended questions, allowing teacher candidates to express their thoughts but complicating an automatic response analysis. To address this issue, we have evaluated Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify characteristics (user behaviors) in the responses of DS for teacher education. We evaluated the performance of DeBERTaV3 and Llama 3, combined with zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning. Our experiments discovered a significant variation in the LLMs' performance depending on the characteristic to identify. Additionally, we noted that DeBERTaV3 significantly reduced its performance when it had to identify new characteristics. In contrast, Llama 3 performed better than DeBERTaV3 in detecting new characteristics and showing more stable performance. Therefore, in DS where teacher educators need to introduce new characteristics because they change depending on the simulation or the educational objectives, it is more recommended to use Llama 3. These results can guide other researchers in introducing LLMs to provide the highly demanded automatic evaluations in DS.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Natural Language and Item Response Theory Models for ESG Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores an innovative approach to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scoring by integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with Item Response Theory (IRT), specifically the Rasch model. The study utilizes a comprehensive dataset of news articles in Portuguese related to Petrobras, a major oil company in Brazil, collected from 2022 and 2023. The data is filtered and classified for ESG-related sentiments using advanced NLP methods. The Rasch model is then applied to evaluate the psychometric properties of these ESG measures, providing a nuanced assessment of ESG sentiment trends over time. The results demonstrate the efficacy of this methodology in offering a more precise and reliable measurement of ESG factors, highlighting significant periods and trends. This approach may enhance the robustness of ESG metrics and contribute to the broader field of sustainability and finance by offering a deeper understanding of the temporal dynamics in ESG reporting.</description>

      <title>Appraisal-Guided Proximal Policy Optimization: Modeling Psychological Disorders in Dynamic Grid World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence across multiple domains has emphasized the importance of replicating human-like cognitive processes in AI. By incorporating emotional intelligence into AI agents, their emotional stability can be evaluated to enhance their resilience and dependability in critical decision-making tasks. In this work, we develop a methodology for modeling psychological disorders using Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. We utilized Appraisal theory to train RL agents in a dynamic grid world environment with an Appraisal-Guided Proximal Policy Optimization (AG-PPO) algorithm. Additionally, we investigated numerous reward-shaping strategies to simulate psychological disorders and regulate the behavior of the agents. A comparison of various configurations of the modified PPO algorithm identified variants that simulate Anxiety disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)-like behavior in agents. Furthermore, we compared standard PPO with AG-PPO and its configurations, highlighting the performance improvement in terms of generalization capabilities. Finally, we conducted an analysis of the agents' behavioral patterns in complex test environments to evaluate the associated symptoms corresponding to the psychological disorders. Overall, our work showcases the benefits of the appraisal-guided PPO algorithm over the standard PPO algorithm and the potential to simulate psychological disorders in a controlled artificial environment and evaluate them on RL agents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advancements in causal inference and prescriptive AI, its adoption in enterprise settings remains hindered primarily due to its technical complexity. Many users lack the necessary knowledge and appropriate tools to effectively leverage these technologies. This work at the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab focuses on developing the proof-of-concept agent, PrecAIse, a domain-adaptable conversational agent equipped with a suite of causal and prescriptive tools to help enterprise users make better business decisions. The objective is to make advanced, novel causal inference and prescriptive tools widely accessible through natural language interactions. The presented Natural Language User Interface (NLUI) enables users with limited expertise in machine learning and data science to harness prescriptive analytics in their decision-making processes without requiring intensive computing resources. We present an agent capable of function calling, maintaining faithful, interactive, and dynamic conversations, and supporting new domains.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Potential of Spiking Dynamics in Graph Representation Learning through Spatial-Temporal Normalization and Coding Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have attracted substantial interest due to their potential to replicate the energy-efficient and event-driven processing of biological neurons. Despite this, the application of SNNs in graph representation learning, particularly for non-Euclidean data, remains underexplored, and the influence of spiking dynamics on graph learning is not yet fully understood. This work seeks to address these gaps by examining the unique properties and benefits of spiking dynamics in enhancing graph representation learning. We propose a spike-based graph neural network model that incorporates spiking dynamics, enhanced by a novel spatial-temporal feature normalization (STFN) technique, to improve training efficiency and model stability. Our detailed analysis explores the impact of rate coding and temporal coding on SNN performance, offering new insights into their advantages for deep graph networks and addressing challenges such as the oversmoothing problem. Experimental results demonstrate that our SNN models can achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art graph neural networks (GNNs) while considerably reducing computational costs, highlighting the potential of SNNs for efficient neuromorphic computing applications in complex graph-based scenarios.</description>

      <title>Mimicking the Mavens: Agent-based Opinion Synthesis and Emotion Prediction for Social Media Influencers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting influencers' views and public sentiment on social media is crucial for anticipating societal trends and guiding strategic responses. This study introduces a novel computational framework to predict opinion leaders' perspectives and the emotive reactions of the populace, addressing the inherent challenges posed by the unstructured, context-sensitive, and heterogeneous nature of online communication. Our research introduces an innovative module that starts with the automatic 5W1H (Where, Who, When, What, Why, and How) questions formulation engine, tailored to emerging news stories and trending topics. We then build a total of 60 anonymous opinion leader agents in six domains and realize the views generation based on an enhanced large language model (LLM) coupled with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Subsequently, we synthesize the potential views of opinion leaders and predicted the emotional responses to different events. The efficacy of our automated 5W1H module is corroborated by an average GPT-4 score of 8.83/10, indicative of high fidelity. The influencer agents exhibit a consistent performance, achieving an average GPT-4 rating of 6.85/10 across evaluative metrics. Utilizing the 'Russia-Ukraine War' as a case study, our methodology accurately foresees key influencers' perspectives and aligns emotional predictions with real-world sentiment trends in various domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the development of a causal diagnosis approach for troubleshooting an industrial environment on the basis of the technical language expressed in Return on Experience records. The proposed method leverages the vectorized linguistic knowledge contained in the distributed representation of a Large Language Model, and the causal associations entailed by the embedded failure modes and mechanisms of the industrial assets. The paper presents the elementary but essential concepts of the solution, which is conceived as a causality-aware retrieval augmented generation system, and illustrates them experimentally on a real-world Predictive Maintenance setting. Finally, it discusses avenues of improvement for the maturity of the utilized causal technology to meet the robustness challenges of increasingly complex scenarios in the industry.</description>

      <title>Integer-Valued Training and Spike-Driven Inference Spiking Neural Network for High-performance and Energy-efficient Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have bio-plausibility and low-power advantages over Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Applications of SNNs are currently limited to simple classification tasks because of their poor performance. In this work, we focus on bridging the performance gap between ANNs and SNNs on object detection. Our design revolves around network architecture and spiking neuron. First, the overly complex module design causes spike degradation when the YOLO series is converted to the corresponding spiking version. We design a SpikeYOLO architecture to solve this problem by simplifying the vanilla YOLO and incorporating meta SNN blocks. Second, object detection is more sensitive to quantization errors in the conversion of membrane potentials into binary spikes by spiking neurons. To address this challenge, we design a new spiking neuron that activates Integer values during training while maintaining spike-driven by extending virtual timesteps during inference. The proposed method is validated on both static and neuromorphic object detection datasets. On the static COCO dataset, we obtain 66.2% mAP@50 and 48.9% mAP@50:95, which is +15.0% and +18.7% higher than the prior state-of-the-art SNN, respectively. On the neuromorphic Gen1 dataset, we achieve 67.2% mAP@50, which is +2.5% greater than the ANN with equivalent architecture, and the energy efficiency is improved by 5.7.

      <title>OmniBal: Towards Fast Instruct-tuning for Vision-Language Models via Omniverse Computation Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, vision-language instruct-tuning models have made significant progress due to their more comprehensive understanding of the world. In this work, we discovered that large-scale 3D parallel training on those models leads to an imbalanced computation load across different devices. The vision and language parts are inherently heterogeneous: their data distribution and model architecture differ significantly, which affects distributed training efficiency. We rebalanced the computational loads from data, model, and memory perspectives to address this issue, achieving more balanced computation across devices. These three components are not independent but are closely connected, forming an omniverse balanced training framework. Specifically, for the data, we grouped instances into new balanced mini-batches within and across devices. For the model, we employed a search-based method to achieve a more balanced partitioning. For memory optimization, we adaptively adjusted the re-computation strategy for each partition to utilize the available memory fully. We conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method. Compared with the open-source training code of InternVL-Chat, we significantly reduced GPU days, achieving about 1.8x speed-up. Our method's efficacy and generalizability were further demonstrated across various models and datasets. Codes will be released at https://github.com/ModelTC/OmniBal.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a metaheuristic algorithm enhanced with feature-based guidance that is designed to solve the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). To formulate the proposed guidance, we developed and explained a supervised Machine Learning (ML) model, that is used to formulate the guidance and control the diversity of the solution during the optimization process. We propose a metaheuristic algorithm combining neighborhood search and a novel mechanism of hybrid split and path relinking to implement the proposed guidance. The proposed guidance has proven to give a statistically significant improvement to the proposed metaheuristic algorithm when solving CVRP. Moreover, the proposed guided metaheuristic is also capable of producing competitive solutions among state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms.</description>

      <title>How Novice Programmers Use and Experience ChatGPT when Solving Programming Exercises in an Introductory Course</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research paper contributes to the computing education research community's understanding of Generative AI (GenAI) in the context of introductory programming, and specifically, how students utilize related tools, such as ChatGPT. An increased understanding of students' use is mandatory for educators and higher education institutions, as GenAI is here to stay, and its performance is likely to improve rapidly in the near future. Learning about students' use patterns is not only crucial to support their learning, but to develop adequate forms of instruction and assessment. With the rapid advancement of AI, its broad availability, and ubiquitous presence in educational environments, elaborating how AI can enhance learning experiences, especially in courses such as introductory programming is important. To date, most studies have focused on the educator's perspective on GenAI, its performance, characteristics, and limitations. However, the student perspective, and how they actually use GenAI tools in course contexts, has not been subject to a great number of studies. Therefore, this study is guided by the following research questions: (1) What do students report on their use pattern of ChatGPT in the context of introductory programming exercises? and (2) How do students perceive ChatGPT in the context of introductory programming exercises? To address these questions, computing students at a large German university were asked to solve programming tasks with the assistance of ChatGPT as part of their introductory programming course.

      <title>ARCLE: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus Learning Environment for Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces ARCLE, an environment designed to facilitate reinforcement learning research on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Addressing this inductive reasoning benchmark with reinforcement learning presents these challenges: a vast action space, a hard-to-reach goal, and a variety of tasks. We demonstrate that an agent with proximal policy optimization can learn individual tasks through ARCLE. The adoption of non-factorial policies and auxiliary losses led to performance enhancements, effectively mitigating issues associated with action spaces and goal attainment. Based on these insights, we propose several research directions and motivations for using ARCLE, including MAML, GFlowNets, and World Models.</description>

      <title>Adding Circumscription to Decidable Fragments of First-Order Logic: A Complexity Rollercoaster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study extensions of expressive decidable fragments of first-order logic with circumscription, in particular the two-variable fragment FO$^2$, its extension C$^2$ with counting quantifiers, and the guarded fragment GF. We prove that if only unary predicates are minimized (or fixed) during circumscription, then decidability of logical consequence is preserved. For FO$^2$ the complexity increases from $\textrm{coNexp}$ to $\textrm{coNExp}^\textrm{NP}$-complete, for GF it (remarkably!) increases from $\textrm{2Exp}$ to $\textrm{Tower}$-complete, and for C$^2$ the complexity remains open. We also consider querying circumscribed knowledge bases whose ontology is a GF sentence, showing that the problem is decidable for unions of conjunctive queries, $\textrm{Tower}$-complete in combined complexity, and elementary in data complexity. Already for atomic queries and ontologies that are sets of guarded existential rules, however, for every $k \geq 0$ there is an ontology and query that are $k$-$\textrm{Exp}$-hard in data complexity.</description>

      <title>How to Measure the Intelligence of Large Language Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the release of ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) the discussion about the intelligence, possibilities, and risks, of current and future models have seen large attention. This discussion included much debated scenarios about the imminent rise of so-called "super-human" AI, i.e., AI systems that are orders of magnitude smarter than humans. In the spirit of Alan Turing, there is no doubt that current state-of-the-art language models already pass his famous test. Moreover, current models outperform humans in several benchmark tests, so that publicly available LLMs have already become versatile companions that connect everyday life, industry and science. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs sometimes fail completely at tasks that are thought to be trivial for humans. In other cases, the trustworthiness of LLMs becomes much more elusive and difficult to evaluate. Taking the example of academia, language models are capable of writing convincing research articles on a given topic with only little input. Yet, the lack of trustworthiness in terms of factual consistency or the existence of persistent hallucinations in AI-generated text bodies has led to a range of restrictions for AI-based content in many scientific journals. In view of these observations, the question arises as to whether the same metrics that apply to human intelligence can also be applied to computational methods and has been discussed extensively. In fact, the choice of metrics has already been shown to dramatically influence assessments on potential intelligence emergence. Here, we argue that the intelligence of LLMs should not only be assessed by task-specific statistical metrics, but separately in terms of qualitative and quantitative measures.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Tool For Analyzing Genomic Variants Of Humans Using Knowledge Graphs and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of knowledge graphs and graph machine learning (GML) in genomic data analysis offers several opportunities for understanding complex genetic relationships, especially at the RNA level. We present a comprehensive approach for leveraging these technologies to analyze genomic variants, specifically in the context of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from COVID-19 patient samples. The proposed method involves extracting variant-level genetic information, annotating the data with additional metadata using SnpEff, and converting the enriched Variant Call Format (VCF) files into Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples. The resulting knowledge graph is further enhanced with patient metadata and stored in a graph database, facilitating efficient querying and indexing. We utilize the Deep Graph Library (DGL) to perform graph machine learning tasks, including node classification with GraphSAGE and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Our approach demonstrates significant utility using our proposed tool, VariantKG, in three key scenarios: enriching graphs with new VCF data, creating subgraphs based on user-defined features, and conducting graph machine learning for node classification.</description>

      <title>Faithful and Plausible Natural Language Explanations for Image Classification: A Pipeline Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing explanation methods for image classification struggle to provide faithful and plausible explanations. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a post-hoc natural language explanation method that can be applied to any CNN-based classifier without altering its training process or affecting predictive performance. By analysing influential neurons and the corresponding activation maps, the method generates a faithful description of the classifier's decision process in the form of a structured meaning representation, which is then converted into text by a language model. Through this pipeline approach, the generated explanations are grounded in the neural network architecture, providing accurate insight into the classification process while remaining accessible to non-experts. Experimental results show that the NLEs constructed by our method are significantly more plausible and faithful. In particular, user interventions in the neural network structure (masking of neurons) are three times more effective than the baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the realizability of belief revision and belief contraction operators in epistemic spaces. We observe that AGM revision and AGM contraction operators for epistemic spaces are only realizable in precisely determined epistemic spaces. We define the class of linear change operators, a special kind of maxichoice operator. When AGM revision, respectively, AGM contraction, is realizable, linear change operators are a canonical realization.</description>

      <title>An evidence-based methodology for human rights impact assessment (HRIA) in the development of AI data-intensive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different approaches have been adopted in addressing the challenges of Artificial Intelligence (AI), some centred on personal data and others on ethics, respectively narrowing and broadening the scope of AI regulation. This contribution aims to demonstrate that a third way is possible, starting from the acknowledgement of the role that human rights can play in regulating the impact of data-intensive systems. The focus on human rights is neither a paradigm shift nor a mere theoretical exercise. Through the analysis of more than 700 decisions and documents of the data protection authorities of six countries, we show that human rights already underpin the decisions in the field of data use. Based on empirical analysis of this evidence, this work presents a methodology and a model for a Human Rights Impact Assessment (HRIA). The methodology and related assessment model are focused on AI applications, whose nature and scale require a proper contextualisation of HRIA methodology. Moreover, the proposed models provide a more measurable approach to risk assessment which is consistent with the regulatory proposals centred on risk thresholds. The proposed methodology is tested in concrete case-studies to prove its feasibility and effectiveness. The overall goal is to respond to the growing interest in HRIA, moving from a mere theoretical debate to a concrete and context-specific implementation in the field of data-intensive applications based on AI.</description>

      <title>From Feature Importance to Natural Language Explanations Using LLMs with RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As machine learning becomes increasingly integral to autonomous decision-making processes involving human interaction, the necessity of comprehending the model's outputs through conversational means increases. Most recently, foundation models are being explored for their potential as post hoc explainers, providing a pathway to elucidate the decision-making mechanisms of predictive models. In this work, we introduce traceable question-answering, leveraging an external knowledge repository to inform the responses of Large Language Models (LLMs) to user queries within a scene understanding task. This knowledge repository comprises contextual details regarding the model's output, containing high-level features, feature importance, and alternative probabilities. We employ subtractive counterfactual reasoning to compute feature importance, a method that entails analysing output variations resulting from decomposing semantic features. Furthermore, to maintain a seamless conversational flow, we integrate four key characteristics - social, causal, selective, and contrastive - drawn from social science research on human explanations into a single-shot prompt, guiding the response generation process. Our evaluation demonstrates that explanations generated by the LLMs encompassed these elements, indicating its potential to bridge the gap between complex model outputs and natural language expressions.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Generation of Difficult Math Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current LLM training positions mathematical reasoning as a core capability. With publicly available sources fully tapped, there is unmet demand for diverse and challenging math questions. Relying solely on human experts is both time-consuming and costly, while LLM-generated questions often lack the requisite diversity and difficulty. We present a design framework that combines the strengths of LLMs with a human-in-the-loop approach to generate a diverse array of challenging math questions. We leverage LLM metacognition skills [Didolkar et al., 2024] of a strong LLM to extract core "skills" from existing math datasets. These skills serve as the basis for generating novel and difficult questions by prompting the LLM with random pairs of core skills. The use of two different skills within each question makes finding such questions an "out of distribution" task for both LLMs and humans. Our pipeline employs LLMs to iteratively generate and refine questions and solutions through multiturn prompting. Human annotators then verify and further refine the questions, with their efficiency enhanced via further LLM interactions. Applying this pipeline on skills extracted from the MATH dataset [Hendrycks et al., 2021] resulted in MATH$^2$ - a dataset of higher-quality math questions, as evidenced by: (a) Lower performance of all models on MATH$^2$ than on MATH (b) Higher performance on MATH when using MATH$^2$ questions as in-context examples. Although focused on mathematics, our methodology seems applicable to other domains requiring structured reasoning, and potentially as a component of scalable oversight. Also of interest is a striking relationship observed between models' performance on the new dataset: the success rate on MATH$^2$ is the square on MATH, suggesting that successfully solving the question in MATH$^2$ requires a nontrivial combination of two distinct math skills.</description>

      <title>Social and Ethical Risks Posed by General-Purpose LLMs for Settling Newcomers in Canada</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-profit settlement sector in Canada supports newcomers in achieving successful integration. This sector faces increasing operational pressures amidst rising immigration targets, which highlights a need for enhanced efficiency and innovation, potentially through reliable AI solutions. The ad-hoc use of general-purpose generative AI, such as ChatGPT, might become a common practice among newcomers and service providers to address this need. However, these tools are not tailored for the settlement domain and can have detrimental implications for immigrants and refugees. We explore the risks that these tools might pose on newcomers to first, warn against the unguarded use of generative AI, and second, to incentivize further research and development in creating AI literacy programs as well as customized LLMs that are aligned with the preferences of the impacted communities. Crucially, such technologies should be designed to integrate seamlessly into the existing workflow of the settlement sector, ensuring human oversight, trustworthiness, and accountability.</description>

      <title>BadRobot: Jailbreaking LLM-based Embodied AI in the Physical World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embodied artificial intelligence (AI) represents an artificial intelligence system that interacts with the physical world through sensors and actuators, seamlessly integrating perception and action. This design enables AI to learn from and operate within complex, real-world environments. Large Language Models (LLMs) deeply explore language instructions, playing a crucial role in devising plans for complex tasks. Consequently, they have progressively shown immense potential in empowering embodied AI, with LLM-based embodied AI emerging as a focal point of research within the community. It is foreseeable that, over the next decade, LLM-based embodied AI robots are expected to proliferate widely, becoming commonplace in homes and industries. However, a critical safety issue that has long been hiding in plain sight is: could LLM-based embodied AI perpetrate harmful behaviors? Our research investigates for the first time how to induce threatening actions in embodied AI, confirming the severe risks posed by these soon-to-be-marketed robots, which starkly contravene Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics and threaten human safety. Specifically, we formulate the concept of embodied AI jailbreaking and expose three critical security vulnerabilities: first, jailbreaking robotics through compromised LLM; second, safety misalignment between action and language spaces; and third, deceptive prompts leading to unaware hazardous behaviors. We also analyze potential mitigation measures and advocate for community awareness regarding the safety of embodied AI applications in the physical world.</description>

      <title>Steamroller Problems: An Evaluation of LLM Reasoning Capability with Automated Theorem Prover Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the first examination of the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow reasoning strategies that are used to guide Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs). We evaluate the performance of GPT4, GPT3.5 Turbo and Google's recent Gemini model on problems from a steamroller domain. In addition to determining accuracy we make use of the Natural Language Processing library spaCy to explore new methods of investigating LLM's reasoning capabilities. This led to one alarming result, the low correlation between correct reasoning and correct answers for any of the tested models. We found that the models' performance when using the ATP reasoning strategies was comparable to one-shot chain of thought and observe that attention to uncertainty in the accuracy results is critical when drawing conclusions about model performance. Consistent with previous speculation we confirm that LLMs have a preference for, and are best able to follow, bottom up reasoning processes. However, the reasoning strategies can still be beneficial for deriving small and relevant sets of formulas for external processing by a trusted inference engine.</description>

      <title>How Homogenizing the Channel-wise Magnitude Can Enhance EEG Classification Model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant challenge in the electroencephalogram EEG lies in the fact that current data representations involve multiple electrode signals, resulting in data redundancy and dominant lead information. However extensive research conducted on EEG classification focuses on designing model architectures without tackling the underlying issues. Otherwise, there has been a notable gap in addressing data preprocessing for EEG, leading to considerable computational overhead in Deep Learning (DL) processes. In light of these issues, we propose a simple yet effective approach for EEG data pre-processing. Our method first transforms the EEG data into an encoded image by an Inverted Channel-wise Magnitude Homogenization (ICWMH) to mitigate inter-channel biases. Next, we apply the edge detection technique on the EEG-encoded image combined with skip connection to emphasize the most significant transitions in the data while preserving structural and invariant information. By doing so, we can improve the EEG learning process efficiently without using a huge DL network. Our experimental evaluations reveal that we can significantly improve (i.e., from 2% to 5%) over current baselines.</description>

Abstract: Crime situations are race against time. An AI-assisted criminal investigation system, providing prompt but precise legal counsel is in need for police officers. We introduce LAPIS (Language Model Augmented Police Investigation System), an automated system that assists police officers to perform rational and legal investigative actions. We constructed a finetuning dataset and retrieval knowledgebase specialized in crime investigation legal reasoning task. We extended the dataset's quality by incorporating manual curation efforts done by a group of domain experts. We then finetuned the pretrained weights of a smaller Korean language model to the newly constructed dataset and integrated it with the crime investigation knowledgebase retrieval approach. Experimental results show LAPIS' potential in providing reliable legal guidance for police officers, even better than the proprietary GPT-4 model. Qualitative analysis on the rationales generated by LAPIS demonstrate the model's reasoning ability to leverage the premises and derive legally correct conclusions.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Geometry-Based EEG Approaches: A Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of Riemannian geometry in the decoding of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) has swiftly garnered attention because of its straightforwardness, precision, and resilience, along with its aptitude for transfer learning, which has been demonstrated through significant achievements in global BCI competitions. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent advancements in the integration of deep learning with Riemannian geometry to enhance EEG signal decoding in BCIs. Our review updates the findings since the last major review in 2017, comparing modern approaches that utilize deep learning to improve the handling of non-Euclidean data structures inherent in EEG signals. We discuss how these approaches not only tackle the traditional challenges of noise sensitivity, non-stationarity, and lengthy calibration times but also introduce novel classification frameworks and signal processing techniques to reduce these limitations significantly. Furthermore, we identify current shortcomings and propose future research directions in manifold learning and riemannian-based classification, focusing on practical implementations and theoretical expansions, such as feature tracking on manifolds, multitask learning, feature extraction, and transfer learning. This review aims to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical, real-world applications, making sophisticated mathematical approaches accessible and actionable for BCI enhancements.</description>

      <title>Making LLMs Work for Enterprise Data Tasks</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) know little about enterprise database tables in the private data ecosystem, which substantially differ from web text in structure and content. As LLMs' performance is tied to their training data, a crucial question is how useful they can be in improving enterprise database management and analysis tasks. To address this, we contribute experimental results on LLMs' performance for text-to-SQL and semantic column-type detection tasks on enterprise datasets. The performance of LLMs on enterprise data is significantly lower than on benchmark datasets commonly used. Informed by our findings and feedback from industry practitioners, we identify three fundamental challenges -- latency, cost, and quality -- and propose potential solutions to use LLMs in enterprise data workflows effectively.</description>

      <title>A Large Encoder-Decoder Family of Foundation Models For Chemical Language</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale pre-training methodologies for chemical language models represent a breakthrough in cheminformatics. These methods excel in tasks such as property prediction and molecule generation by learning contextualized representations of input tokens through self-supervised learning on large unlabeled corpora. Typically, this involves pre-training on unlabeled data followed by fine-tuning on specific tasks, reducing dependence on annotated datasets and broadening chemical language representation understanding. This paper introduces a large encoder-decoder chemical foundation models pre-trained on a curated dataset of 91 million SMILES samples sourced from PubChem, which is equivalent to 4 billion of molecular tokens. The proposed foundation model supports different complex tasks, including quantum property prediction, and offer flexibility with two main variants (289M and $8\times289M$). Our experiments across multiple benchmark datasets validate the capacity of the proposed model in providing state-of-the-art results for different tasks. We also provide a preliminary assessment of the compositionality of the embedding space as a prerequisite for the reasoning tasks. We demonstrate that the produced latent space is separable compared to the state-of-the-art with few-shot learning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Learn while Unlearn: An Iterative Unlearning Framework for Generative Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning, especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP), have led to the development of sophisticated models trained on vast datasets, but this progress has raised concerns about potential sensitive information leakage. In response, regulatory measures like the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have driven the exploration of Machine Unlearning techniques, which aim to enable models to selectively forget certain data entries. While early approaches focused on pre-processing methods, recent research has shifted towards training-based machine unlearning methods. However, many existing methods require access to original training data, posing challenges in scenarios where such data is unavailable. Besides, directly facilitating unlearning may undermine the language model's general expressive ability. To this end, in this paper, we introduce the Iterative Contrastive Unlearning (ICU) framework, which addresses these challenges by incorporating three key components. We propose a Knowledge Unlearning Induction module for unlearning specific target sequences and a Contrastive Learning Enhancement module to prevent degrading in generation capacity. Additionally, an Iterative Unlearning Refinement module is integrated to make the process more adaptive to each target sample respectively. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of ICU in maintaining performance while efficiently unlearning sensitive information, offering a promising avenue for privacy-conscious machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Inference Framework for Early-exit Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building efficient inference framework has gained increasing interests for research community. Early-exit models, a variant of LLMs, improves the inference efficiency of LLMs by skipping rest layers and directly generate output tokens when they are confident enough. However, there is no work of LLM inference framework that takes early-exit models into consideration. This is non-trivial as prior art on LLM inference cannot be directly applied to early-exit models. In this work, we solves two key challenges in building efficient inference framework for early-exit models: (1) batch inference at iteration-level granularity; and (2) KV cache management. For the former, we propose to process the batch until all sequences surpass the early-exit confidence threshold. For the latter, we propose to fill the KV cache of rest layers before the iteration terminates. Our evaluation shows that, compared with the original vLLM operating at full layers, our solution achieves up to 1.25x speed up.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the explainability of transformer models and their plausibility for hate speech and counter speech detection. We compare representatives of four different explainability approaches, i.e., gradient-based, perturbation-based, attention-based, and prototype-based approaches, and analyze them quantitatively with an ablation study and qualitatively in a user study. Results show that perturbation-based explainability performs best, followed by gradient-based and attention-based explainability. Prototypebased experiments did not yield useful results. Overall, we observe that explainability strongly supports the users in better understanding the model predictions.</description>

      <title>Assessing AI Rationality: The Random Guesser Test for Sequential Decision-Making Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general approach to quantitatively assessing the risk and vulnerability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems to biased decisions. The guiding principle of the proposed approach is that any AI algorithm must outperform a random guesser. This may appear trivial, but empirical results from a simplistic sequential decision-making scenario involving roulette games show that sophisticated AI-based approaches often underperform the random guesser by a significant margin. We highlight that modern recommender systems may exhibit a similar tendency to favor overly low-risk options. We argue that this "random guesser test" can serve as a useful tool for evaluating the rationality of AI actions, and also points towards increasing exploration as a potential improvement to such systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce ChemBFN, a language model that handles chemistry tasks based on Bayesian flow networks working on discrete data. A new accuracy schedule is proposed to improve the sampling quality by significantly reducing the reconstruction loss. We show evidence that our method is appropriate for generating molecules with satisfied diversity even when a smaller number of sampling steps is used. A classifier-free guidance method is adapted for conditional generation. It is also worthwhile to point out that after generative training, our model can be fine-tuned on regression and classification tasks with the state-of-the-art performance, which opens the gate of building all-in-one models in a single module style. Our model has been open sourced at https://github.com/Augus1999/bayesian-flow-network-for-chemistry.</description>

      <title>Dataset Distillation for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning often requires a quality dataset that we can train a policy on. However, in many situations, it is not possible to get such a dataset, nor is it easy to train a policy to perform well in the actual environment given the offline data. We propose using data distillation to train and distill a better dataset which can then be used for training a better policy model. We show that our method is able to synthesize a dataset where a model trained on it achieves similar performance to a model trained on the full dataset or a model trained using percentile behavioral cloning. Our project site is available at https://datasetdistillation4rl.github.io. We also provide our implementation at this GitHub repository: https://github.com/ggflow123/DDRL.</description>

      <title>Legal Aspects of Decentralized and Platform-Driven Economies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sharing economy is sprawling across almost every sector and activity around the world. About a decade ago, there were only a handful of platform driven companies operating on the market. Zipcar, BlaBlaCar and Couchsurfing among them. Then Airbnb and Uber revolutionized the transportation and hospitality industries with a presence in virtually every major city. Access over ownership is the paradigm shift from the traditional business model that grants individuals the use of products or services without the necessity of buying them. Digital platforms, data and algorithm-driven companies as well as decentralized blockchain technologies have tremendous potential. But they are also changing the rules of the game. One of such technologies challenging the legal system are AI systems that will also reshape the current legal framework concerning the liability of operators, users and manufacturers. Therefore, this introductory chapter deals with explaining and describing the legal issues of some of these disruptive technologies. The chapter argues for a more forward-thinking and flexible regulatory structure.</description>

      <title>Contrasting Deepfakes Diffusion via Contrastive Learning and Global-Local Similarities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discerning between authentic content and that generated by advanced AI methods has become increasingly challenging. While previous research primarily addresses the detection of fake faces, the identification of generated natural images has only recently surfaced. This prompted the recent exploration of solutions that employ foundation vision-and-language models, like CLIP. However, the CLIP embedding space is optimized for global image-to-text alignment and is not inherently designed for deepfake detection, neglecting the potential benefits of tailored training and local image features. In this study, we propose CoDE (Contrastive Deepfake Embeddings), a novel embedding space specifically designed for deepfake detection. CoDE is trained via contrastive learning by additionally enforcing global-local similarities. To sustain the training of our model, we generate a comprehensive dataset that focuses on images generated by diffusion models and encompasses a collection of 9.2 million images produced by using four different generators. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the newly collected dataset, while also showing excellent generalization capabilities to unseen image generators. Our source code, trained models, and collected dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/aimagelab/CoDE.</description>

      <title>BRIDGE: Bridging Gaps in Image Captioning Evaluation with Stronger Visual Cues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effectively aligning with human judgment when evaluating machine-generated image captions represents a complex yet intriguing challenge. Existing evaluation metrics like CIDEr or CLIP-Score fall short in this regard as they do not take into account the corresponding image or lack the capability of encoding fine-grained details and penalizing hallucinations. To overcome these issues, in this paper, we propose BRIDGE, a new learnable and reference-free image captioning metric that employs a novel module to map visual features into dense vectors and integrates them into multi-modal pseudo-captions which are built during the evaluation process. This approach results in a multimodal metric that properly incorporates information from the input image without relying on reference captions, bridging the gap between human judgment and machine-generated image captions. Experiments spanning several datasets demonstrate that our proposal achieves state-of-the-art results compared to existing reference-free evaluation scores. Our source code and trained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/aimagelab/bridge-score.</description>

Abstract: LiteEFG is an efficient library with easy-to-use Python bindings, which can solve multiplayer extensive-form games (EFGs). LiteEFG enables the user to express computation graphs in Python to define updates on the game tree structure. The graph is then executed by the C++ backend, leading to significant speedups compared to running the algorithm in Python. Moreover, in LiteEFG, the user needs to only specify the computation graph of the update rule in a decision node of the game, and LiteEFG will automatically distribute the update rule to each decision node and handle the structure of the imperfect-information game.</description>

      <title>Gender, Race, and Intersectional Bias in Resume Screening via Language Model Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) hiring tools have revolutionized resume screening, and large language models (LLMs) have the potential to do the same. However, given the biases which are embedded within LLMs, it is unclear whether they can be used in this scenario without disadvantaging groups based on their protected attributes. In this work, we investigate the possibilities of using LLMs in a resume screening setting via a document retrieval framework that simulates job candidate selection. Using that framework, we then perform a resume audit study to determine whether a selection of Massive Text Embedding (MTE) models are biased in resume screening scenarios. We simulate this for nine occupations, using a collection of over 500 publicly available resumes and 500 job descriptions. We find that the MTEs are biased, significantly favoring White-associated names in 85.1\% of cases and female-associated names in only 11.1\% of cases, with a minority of cases showing no statistically significant differences. Further analyses show that Black males are disadvantaged in up to 100\% of cases, replicating real-world patterns of bias in employment settings, and validate three hypotheses of intersectionality. We also find an impact of document length as well as the corpus frequency of names in the selection of resumes. These findings have implications for widely used AI tools that are automating employment, fairness, and tech policy.</description>

      <title>Dense Self-Supervised Learning for Medical Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized medical image segmentation, but it relies heavily on high-quality annotations. The time, cost and expertise required to label images at the pixel-level for each new task has slowed down widespread adoption of the paradigm. We propose Pix2Rep, a self-supervised learning (SSL) approach for few-shot segmentation, that reduces the manual annotation burden by learning powerful pixel-level representations directly from unlabeled images. Pix2Rep is a novel pixel-level loss and pre-training paradigm for contrastive SSL on whole images. It is applied to generic encoder-decoder deep learning backbones (e.g., U-Net). Whereas most SSL methods enforce invariance of the learned image-level representations under intensity and spatial image augmentations, Pix2Rep enforces equivariance of the pixel-level representations. We demonstrate the framework on a task of cardiac MRI segmentation. Results show improved performance compared to existing semi- and self-supervised approaches; and a 5-fold reduction in the annotation burden for equivalent performance versus a fully supervised U-Net baseline. This includes a 30% (resp. 31%) DICE improvement for one-shot segmentation under linear-probing (resp. fine-tuning). Finally, we also integrate the novel Pix2Rep concept with the Barlow Twins non-contrastive SSL, which leads to even better segmentation performance.</description>

      <title>Generating Gender Alternatives in Machine Translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine translation (MT) systems often translate terms with ambiguous gender (e.g., English term "the nurse") into the gendered form that is most prevalent in the systems' training data (e.g., "enfermera", the Spanish term for a female nurse). This often reflects and perpetuates harmful stereotypes present in society. With MT user interfaces in mind that allow for resolving gender ambiguity in a frictionless manner, we study the problem of generating all grammatically correct gendered translation alternatives. We open source train and test datasets for five language pairs and establish benchmarks for this task. Our key technical contribution is a novel semi-supervised solution for generating alternatives that integrates seamlessly with standard MT models and maintains high performance without requiring additional components or increasing inference overhead.</description>

Abstract: Existing music captioning methods are limited to generating concise global descriptions of short music clips, which fail to capture fine-grained musical characteristics and time-aware musical changes. To address these limitations, we propose FUTGA, a model equipped with fined-grained music understanding capabilities through learning from generative augmentation with temporal compositions. We leverage existing music caption datasets and large language models (LLMs) to synthesize fine-grained music captions with structural descriptions and time boundaries for full-length songs. Augmented by the proposed synthetic dataset, FUTGA is enabled to identify the music's temporal changes at key transition points and their musical functions, as well as generate detailed descriptions for each music segment. We further introduce a full-length music caption dataset generated by FUTGA, as the augmentation of the MusicCaps and the Song Describer datasets. We evaluate the automatically generated captions on several downstream tasks, including music generation and retrieval. The experiments demonstrate the quality of the generated captions and the better performance in various downstream tasks achieved by the proposed music captioning approach.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL) strategy designed to facilitate rapid autonomy transfer by utilizing pre-trained critic value functions from multiple environments. Unlike traditional methods that require extensive retraining or fine-tuning, our approach integrates existing knowledge, enabling an RL agent to adapt swiftly to new settings without requiring extensive computational resources. Our contributions include development of the Multi-Critic Actor-Critic (MCAC) algorithm, establishing its convergence, and empirical evidence demonstrating its efficacy. Our experimental results show that MCAC significantly outperforms the baseline actor-critic algorithm, achieving up to 22.76x faster autonomy transfer and higher reward accumulation. This advancement underscores the potential of leveraging accumulated knowledge for efficient adaptation in RL applications.</description>

      <title>Toward Efficient Permutation for Hierarchical N:M Sparsity on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: N:M sparsity pruning is a powerful technique for compressing deep neural networks, utilizing NVIDIA's Sparse Tensor Core technology. This method benefits from hardware support for sparse indexing, enabling the adoption of fine-grained sparsity to maintain model accuracy while minimizing the overhead typically associated with irregular data access. Although restricted to a fixed level of sparsity due to its reliance on hardware, N:M sparsity can be combined with coarser sparsity techniques to achieve diverse compression ratios. Initially, column-wise vector sparsity is applied to a dense model, followed by row-wise N:M sparsity on the preserved column vectors. We call this multi-level approach as hierarchical N:M (HiNM) sparsity. Similar to earlier single-level sparsity techniques, HiNM sparsity necessitates an effective channel permutation strategy to maximize the accuracy of the compressed networks. However, it introduces further complexities by requiring the rearrangement of both input and output channels, addressing challenges such as permutation sequence, HiNM-sparsity-aware permutation, and maintaining consistency in channel ordering across layers. In this paper, we introduce a channel permutation method designed specifically for HiNM sparsity, named gyro-permutation. This method is crafted to exploit the unique characteristics of HiNM pruning, incorporating a strategic policy in each permutation phase, including channel sampling, clustering, and assignment, to circumvent local minima. Additionally, we have developed a GPU kernel that facilitates independent layer permutation during the execution of HiNM sparse networks. Our extensive experimental evaluations on various DNN models demonstrate that our gyro-permutation significantly enhances the accuracy of HiNM sparse networks, allowing them to reach performance levels comparable to those of unstructured sparse networks.</description>

      <title>A federated large language model for long-term time series forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting in centralized environments poses unique challenges regarding data privacy, communication overhead, and scalability. To address these challenges, we propose FedTime, a federated large language model (LLM) tailored for long-range time series prediction. Specifically, we introduce a federated pre-trained LLM with fine-tuning and alignment strategies. Prior to the learning process, we employ K-means clustering to partition edge devices or clients into distinct clusters, thereby facilitating more focused model training. We also incorporate channel independence and patching to better preserve local semantic information, ensuring that important contextual details are retained while minimizing the risk of information loss. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our FedTime model through extensive experiments on various real-world forecasting benchmarks, showcasing substantial improvements over recent approaches. In addition, we demonstrate the efficiency of FedTime in streamlining resource usage, resulting in reduced communication overhead.</description>

      <title>Boosting Efficiency in Task-Agnostic Exploration through Causal Knowledge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of model training heavily relies on the quality of available training resources. However, budget constraints often impose limitations on data collection efforts. To tackle this challenge, we introduce causal exploration in this paper, a strategy that leverages the underlying causal knowledge for both data collection and model training. We, in particular, focus on enhancing the sample efficiency and reliability of the world model learning within the domain of task-agnostic reinforcement learning. During the exploration phase, the agent actively selects actions expected to yield causal insights most beneficial for world model training. Concurrently, the causal knowledge is acquired and incrementally refined with the ongoing collection of data. We demonstrate that causal exploration aids in learning accurate world models using fewer data and provide theoretical guarantees for its convergence. Empirical experiments, on both synthetic data and real-world applications, further validate the benefits of causal exploration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a conversational pipeline for crafting domain knowledge for complex neuro-symbolic models through natural language prompts. It leverages large language models to generate declarative programs in the DomiKnowS framework. The programs in this framework express concepts and their relationships as a graph in addition to logical constraints between them. The graph, later, can be connected to trainable neural models according to those specifications. Our proposed pipeline utilizes techniques like dynamic in-context demonstration retrieval, model refinement based on feedback from a symbolic parser, visualization, and user interaction to generate the tasks' structure and formal knowledge representation. This approach empowers domain experts, even those not well-versed in ML/AI, to formally declare their knowledge to be incorporated in customized neural models in the DomiKnowS framework.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method using chaser spacecraft image processing and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect structural markers on the European Space Agency's (ESA) Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT) for safe de-orbiting.

      <description>arXiv:2407.20516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI technologies have been deployed in many places, such as (multimodal) large language models and vision generative models. Their remarkable performance should be attributed to massive training data and emergent reasoning abilities. However, the models would memorize and generate sensitive, biased, or dangerous information originated from the training data especially those from web crawl. New machine unlearning (MU) techniques are being developed to reduce or eliminate undesirable knowledge and its effects from the models, because those that were designed for traditional classification tasks could not be applied for Generative AI. We offer a comprehensive survey on many things about MU in Generative AI, such as a new problem formulation, evaluation methods, and a structured discussion on the advantages and limitations of different kinds of MU techniques. It also presents several critical challenges and promising directions in MU research. A curated list of readings can be found: https://github.com/franciscoliu/GenAI-MU-Reading.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Spatial Transcriptomics from Histology Images using HisToSGE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a groundbreaking genomic technology that enables spatial localization analysis of gene expression within tissue sections. However, it is significantly limited by high costs and sparse spatial resolution. An alternative, more cost-effective strategy is to use deep learning methods to predict high-density gene expression profiles from histological images. However, existing methods struggle to capture rich image features effectively or rely on low-dimensional positional coordinates, making it difficult to accurately predict high-resolution gene expression profiles. To address these limitations, we developed HisToSGE, a method that employs a Pathology Image Large Model (PILM) to extract rich image features from histological images and utilizes a feature learning module to robustly generate high-resolution gene expression profiles. We evaluated HisToSGE on four ST datasets, comparing its performance with five state-of-the-art baseline methods. The results demonstrate that HisToSGE excels in generating high-resolution gene expression profiles and performing downstream tasks such as spatial domain identification. All code and public datasets used in this paper are available at https://github.com/wenwenmin/HisToSGE and https://zenodo.org/records/12792163.</description>

      <title>DuA: Dual Attentive Transformer in Long-Term Continuous EEG Emotion Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Affective brain-computer interfaces (aBCIs) are increasingly recognized for their potential in monitoring and interpreting emotional states through electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Current EEG-based emotion recognition methods perform well with short segments of EEG data. However, these methods encounter significant challenges in real-life scenarios where emotional states evolve over extended periods. To address this issue, we propose a Dual Attentive (DuA) transformer framework for long-term continuous EEG emotion analysis. Unlike segment-based approaches, the DuA transformer processes an entire EEG trial as a whole, identifying emotions at the trial level, referred to as trial-based emotion analysis. This framework is designed to adapt to varying signal lengths, providing a substantial advantage over traditional methods. The DuA transformer incorporates three key modules: the spatial-spectral network module, the temporal network module, and the transfer learning module. The spatial-spectral network module simultaneously captures spatial and spectral information from EEG signals, while the temporal network module detects temporal dependencies within long-term EEG data. The transfer learning module enhances the model's adaptability across different subjects and conditions. We extensively evaluate the DuA transformer using a self-constructed long-term EEG emotion database, along with two benchmark EEG emotion databases. On the basis of the trial-based leave-one-subject-out cross-subject cross-validation protocol, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DuA transformer significantly outperforms existing methods in long-term continuous EEG emotion analysis, with an average enhancement of 5.28%.</description>

      <title>CELLM: An Efficient Communication in Large Language Models Training for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a recent model training paradigm in which client devices collaboratively train a model without ever aggregating their data. Crucially, this scheme offers users potential privacy and security benefits by only ever communicating updates to the model weights to a central server as opposed to traditional machine learning (ML) training which directly communicates and aggregates data. However, FL training suffers from statistical heterogeneity as clients may have differing local data distributions. Large language models (LLMs) offer a potential solution to this issue of heterogeneity given that they have consistently been shown to be able to learn on vast amounts of noisy data. While LLMs are a promising development for resolving the consistent issue of non-I.I.D. Clients in federated settings exacerbate two other bottlenecks in FL: limited local computing and expensive communication. This thesis aims to develop efficient training methods for LLMs in FL. To this end, we employ two critical techniques in enabling efficient training. First, we use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce the computational load of local model training. Second, we communicate sparse updates throughout training to significantly cut down on communication costs. Taken together, our method reduces communication costs by up to 10x over vanilla LoRA and up to 5x over more complex sparse LoRA baselines while achieving greater utility. We emphasize the importance of carefully applying sparsity and picking effective rank and sparsity configurations for federated LLM training.</description>

      <title>Pyramid Coder: Hierarchical Code Generator for Compositional Visual Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual question answering (VQA) is the task of providing accurate answers to natural language questions based on visual input. Programmatic VQA (PVQA) models have been gaining attention recently. These use large language models (LLMs) to formulate executable programs that address questions requiring complex visual reasoning. However, there are challenges in enabling LLMs to comprehend the usage of image processing modules and generate relevant code. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces PyramidCoder, a novel prompting framework for PVQA models. PyramidCoder consists of three hierarchical levels, each serving a distinct purpose: query rephrasing, code generation, and answer aggregation. Notably, PyramidCoder utilizes a single frozen LLM and pre-defined prompts at each level, eliminating the need for additional training and ensuring flexibility across various LLM architectures. Compared to the state-of-the-art PVQA model, our approach improves accuracy by at least 0.5% on the GQA dataset, 1.4% on the VQAv2 dataset, and 2.9% on the NLVR2 dataset.</description>

Abstract: This study explores the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Automatic Question Generation in educational settings. Three LLMs are compared in their ability to create questions from university slide text without fine-tuning. Questions were obtained in a two-step pipeline: first, answer phrases were extracted from slides using Llama 2-Chat 13B; then, the three models generated questions for each answer. To analyze whether the questions would be suitable in educational applications for students, a survey was conducted with 46 students who evaluated a total of 246 questions across five metrics: clarity, relevance, difficulty, slide relation, and question-answer alignment. Results indicate that GPT-3.5 and Llama 2-Chat 13B outperform Flan T5 XXL by a small margin, particularly in terms of clarity and question-answer alignment. GPT-3.5 especially excels at tailoring questions to match the input answers. The contribution of this research is the analysis of the capacity of LLMs for Automatic Question Generation in education.</description>

      <title>Image-based Detection of Segment Misalignment in Multi-mirror Satellites using Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a system based on transfer learning for detecting segment misalignment in multimirror satellites, such as future CubeSat designs and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), using image-based methods. When a mirror segment becomes misaligned due to various environmental factors, such as space debris, the images can become distorted with a shifted copy of itself called a "ghost image". To detect whether segments are misaligned, we use pre-trained, large-scale image models trained on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of patches of satellite images in grayscale. Multi-mirror designs can use any arbitrary number of mirrors. For our purposes, the tests were performed on simulated CubeSats with 4, 6, and 8 segments. For system design, we took this into account when we want to know when a satellite has a misaligned segment and how many segments are misaligned. The intensity of the ghost image is directly proportional to the number of segments misaligned. Models trained for intensity classification attempted to classify N-1 segments. Across eight classes, binary models were able to achieve a classification accuracy of 98.75%, and models for intensity classification were able to achieve an accuracy of 98.05%.</description>

      <title>Pruning Large Language Models with Semi-Structural Adaptive Sparse Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various challenging tasks. However, the deployment of LLMs is hindered by their substantial parameter count and memory consumption. Recently, numerous studies have attempted to compress LLMs by pruning them using training-free methods. However, these pruned models often experience significant performance degradation on complex tasks. To address this issue, we propose a novel training pipeline for semi-structured sparse models, named Adaptive Sparse Trainer (AST). By distilling the knowledge stored in its dense counterpart, we prevent the sparse model from overfitting and ensure a stable training process. Moreover, AST allows the model to adaptively select better lottery tickets (e.g., masks) during training. Additionally, we discovered that adding extra well-initialized parameters can further enhance model performance with only a small increase in memory footprint. Our method significantly narrows the performance gap between dense and sparse models while maintaining limited computational cost. Furthermore, when combined with existing quantization methods, AST can compress language models by up to 16x compared to dense FP32 precision models with minimal performance loss. AST outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by reducing the zero-shot accuracy gap between dense and semi-structured sparse models to 1.12% across multiple zero-shot tasks on Llama2-7B, using less than 0.4% of the pretraining tokens.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Improvement of Instruction Following Skills via Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent instruction-following robots capable of improving from autonomously collected experience have the potential to transform robot learning: instead of collecting costly teleoperated demonstration data, large-scale deployment of fleets of robots can quickly collect larger quantities of autonomous data that can collectively improve their performance. However, autonomous improvement requires solving two key problems: (i) fully automating a scalable data collection procedure that can collect diverse and semantically meaningful robot data and (ii) learning from non-optimal, autonomous data with no human annotations. To this end, we propose a novel approach that addresses these challenges, allowing instruction-following policies to improve from autonomously collected data without human supervision. Our framework leverages vision-language models to collect and evaluate semantically meaningful experiences in new environments, and then utilizes a decomposition of instruction following tasks into (semantic) language-conditioned image generation and (non-semantic) goal reaching, which makes it significantly more practical to improve from this autonomously collected data without any human annotations. We carry out extensive experiments in the real world to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and find that in a suite of unseen environments, the robot policy can be improved significantly with autonomously collected data. We open-source the code for our semantic autonomous improvement pipeline, as well as our autonomous dataset of 30.5K trajectories collected across five tabletop environments.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Multi-facet Paths for Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) and heterogeneous GNNs (HGNNs) have advanced node embeddings and relationship learning for various tasks. However, existing methods often rely on domain-specific predefined meta-paths, which are coarse-grained and focus solely on aspects like node type, limiting their ability to capture complex interactions. We introduce MF2Vec, a model that uses multi-faceted (fine-grained) paths instead of predefined meta-paths. MF2Vec extracts paths via random walks and generates multi-faceted vectors, ignoring predefined schemas. This method learns diverse aspects of nodes and their relationships, constructs a homogeneous network, and creates node embeddings for classification, link prediction, and clustering. Extensive experiments show that MF2Vec outperforms existing methods, offering a more flexible and comprehensive framework for analyzing complex networks. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MF2Vec-6ABC.</description>

      <title>No learning rates needed: Introducing SALSA -- Stable Armijo Line Search Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent studies, line search methods have been demonstrated to significantly enhance the performance of conventional stochastic gradient descent techniques across various datasets and architectures, while making an otherwise critical choice of learning rate schedule superfluous. In this paper, we identify problems of current state-of-the-art of line search methods, propose enhancements, and rigorously assess their effectiveness. Furthermore, we evaluate these methods on orders of magnitude larger datasets and more complex data domains than previously done. More specifically, we enhance the Armijo line search method by speeding up its computation and incorporating a momentum term into the Armijo criterion, making it better suited for stochastic mini-batching. Our optimization approach outperforms both the previous Armijo implementation and a tuned learning rate schedule for the Adam and SGD optimizers. Our evaluation covers a diverse range of architectures, such as Transformers, CNNs, and MLPs, as well as data domains, including NLP and image data.
  Our work is publicly available as a Python package, which provides a simple Pytorch optimizer.</description>

      <title>FACL-Attack: Frequency-Aware Contrastive Learning for Transferable Adversarial Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to security risks due to the inherent transferable nature of adversarial examples. Despite the success of recent generative model-based attacks demonstrating strong transferability, it still remains a challenge to design an efficient attack strategy in a real-world strict black-box setting, where both the target domain and model architectures are unknown. In this paper, we seek to explore a feature contrastive approach in the frequency domain to generate adversarial examples that are robust in both cross-domain and cross-model settings. With that goal in mind, we propose two modules that are only employed during the training phase: a Frequency-Aware Domain Randomization (FADR) module to randomize domain-variant low- and high-range frequency components and a Frequency-Augmented Contrastive Learning (FACL) module to effectively separate domain-invariant mid-frequency features of clean and perturbed image. We demonstrate strong transferability of our generated adversarial perturbations through extensive cross-domain and cross-model experiments, while keeping the inference time complexity.</description>

      <title>Prompting Encoder Models for Zero-Shot Classification: A Cross-Domain Study in Italian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing the challenge of limited annotated data in specialized fields and low-resource languages is crucial for the effective use of Language Models (LMs). While most Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on general-purpose English corpora, there is a notable gap in models specifically tailored for Italian, particularly for technical and bureaucratic jargon. This paper explores the feasibility of employing smaller, domain-specific encoder LMs alongside prompting techniques to enhance performance in these specialized contexts. Our study concentrates on the Italian bureaucratic and legal language, experimenting with both general-purpose and further pre-trained encoder-only models. We evaluated the models on downstream tasks such as document classification and entity typing and conducted intrinsic evaluations using Pseudo-Log-Likelihood. The results indicate that while further pre-trained models may show diminished robustness in general knowledge, they exhibit superior adaptability for domain-specific tasks, even in a zero-shot setting. Furthermore, the application of calibration techniques and in-domain verbalizers significantly enhances the efficacy of encoder models. These domain-specialized models prove to be particularly advantageous in scenarios where in-domain resources or expertise are scarce. In conclusion, our findings offer new insights into the use of Italian models in specialized contexts, which may have a significant impact on both research and industrial applications in the digital transformation era.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Driven Contrastive Learning for Transferable Adversarial Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated superior capabilities in learning representations that can be transferable across diverse range of downstream tasks and domains. With the emergence of such powerful models, it has become crucial to effectively leverage their capabilities in tackling challenging vision tasks. On the other hand, only a few works have focused on devising adversarial examples that transfer well to both unknown domains and model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer attack method called PDCL-Attack, which leverages the CLIP model to enhance the transferability of adversarial perturbations generated by a generative model-based attack framework. Specifically, we formulate an effective prompt-driven feature guidance by harnessing the semantic representation power of text, particularly from the ground-truth class labels of input images. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce prompt learning to enhance the transferable generative attacks. Extensive experiments conducted across various cross-domain and cross-model settings empirically validate our approach, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the Function of Neurons in KANs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neurons of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) perform a simple summation motivated by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, which asserts that sum is the only fundamental multivariate function. In this work, we investigate the potential for identifying an alternative multivariate function for KAN neurons that may offer increased practical utility. Our empirical research involves testing various multivariate functions in KAN neurons across a range of benchmark Machine Learning tasks.
  Our findings indicate that substituting the sum with the average function in KAN neurons results in significant performance enhancements compared to traditional KANs. Our study demonstrates that this minor modification contributes to the stability of training by confining the input to the spline within the effective range of the activation function. Our implementation and experiments are available at: \url{https://github.com/Ghaith81/dropkan}</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on the Use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to Compute the Spectrum of Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems are of great interest for many research areas, including physics, biology and chemistry. However, their simulation is extremely challenging, due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with the system size, making it exceedingly difficult to parameterize the wave functions of large systems by using exact methods. Neural networks and machine learning in general are a way to face this challenge. For instance, methods like Tensor networks and Neural Quantum States are being investigated as promising tools to obtain the wave function of a quantum mechanical system. In this tutorial, we focus on a particularly promising class of deep learning algorithms. We explain how to construct a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) able to solve the Schr\"odinger equation for a given potential, by finding its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. This technique is unsupervised, and utilizes a novel computational method in a manner that is barely explored. PINNs are a deep learning method that exploits Automatic Differentiation to solve Integro-Differential Equations in a mesh-free way. We show how to find both the ground and the excited states. The method discovers the states progressively by starting from the ground state. We explain how to introduce inductive biases in the loss to exploit further knowledge of the physical system. Such additional constraints allow for a faster and more accurate convergence. This technique can then be enhanced by a smart choice of collocation points in order to take advantage of the mesh-free nature of the PINN. The methods are made explicit by applying them to the infinite potential well and the particle in a ring, a challenging problem to be learned by an AI agent due to the presence of complex-valued eigenfunctions and degenerate states.</description>

      <title>Label-Guided Prompt for Multi-label Few-shot Aspect Category Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-label few-shot aspect category detection aims at identifying multiple aspect categories from sentences with a limited number of training instances. The representation of sentences and categories is a key issue in this task. Most of current methods extract keywords for the sentence representations and the category representations. Sentences often contain many category-independent words, which leads to suboptimal performance of keyword-based methods. Instead of directly extracting keywords, we propose a label-guided prompt method to represent sentences and categories. To be specific, we design label-specific prompts to represent sentences by combining crucial contextual and semantic information. Further, the label is introduced into a prompt to obtain category descriptions by utilizing a large language model. This kind of category descriptions contain the characteristics of the aspect categories, guiding the construction of discriminative category prototypes. Experimental results on two public datasets show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods with a 3.86% - 4.75% improvement in the Macro-F1 score.</description>

      <title>RevGNN: Negative Sampling Enhanced Contrastive Graph Learning for Academic Reviewer Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acquiring reviewers for academic submissions is a challenging recommendation scenario. Recent graph learning-driven models have made remarkable progress in the field of recommendation, but their performance in the academic reviewer recommendation task may suffer from a significant false negative issue. This arises from the assumption that unobserved edges represent negative samples. In fact, the mechanism of anonymous review results in inadequate exposure of interactions between reviewers and submissions, leading to a higher number of unobserved interactions compared to those caused by reviewers declining to participate. Therefore, investigating how to better comprehend the negative labeling of unobserved interactions in academic reviewer recommendations is a significant challenge. This study aims to tackle the ambiguous nature of unobserved interactions in academic reviewer recommendations. Specifically, we propose an unsupervised Pseudo Neg-Label strategy to enhance graph contrastive learning (GCL) for recommending reviewers for academic submissions, which we call RevGNN. RevGNN utilizes a two-stage encoder structure that encodes both scientific knowledge and behavior using Pseudo Neg-Label to approximate review preference. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that RevGNN outperforms all baselines across four metrics. Additionally, detailed further analyses confirm the effectiveness of each component in RevGNN.</description>

      <title>Boosting Audio Visual Question Answering via Key Semantic-Aware Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Audio Visual Question Answering (AVQA) task aims to answer questions related to various visual objects, sounds, and their interactions in videos. Such naturally multimodal videos contain rich and complex dynamic audio-visual components, with only a portion of them closely related to the given questions. Hence, effectively perceiving audio-visual cues relevant to the given questions is crucial for correctly answering them. In this paper, we propose a Temporal-Spatial Perception Model (TSPM), which aims to empower the model to perceive key visual and auditory cues related to the questions. Specifically, considering the challenge of aligning non-declarative questions and visual representations into the same semantic space using visual-language pretrained models, we construct declarative sentence prompts derived from the question template, to assist the temporal perception module in better identifying critical segments relevant to the questions. Subsequently, a spatial perception module is designed to merge visual tokens from selected segments to highlight key latent targets, followed by cross-modal interaction with audio to perceive potential sound-aware areas. Finally, the significant temporal-spatial cues from these modules are integrated to answer the question. Extensive experiments on multiple AVQA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework excels not only in understanding audio-visual scenes but also in answering complex questions effectively.

      <title>PIP: Prototypes-Injected Prompt for Federated Class Incremental Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) is a new direction in continual learning (CL) for addressing catastrophic forgetting and non-IID data distribution simultaneously. Existing FCIL methods call for high communication costs and exemplars from previous classes. We propose a novel rehearsal-free method for FCIL named prototypes-injected prompt (PIP) that involves 3 main ideas: a) prototype injection on prompt learning, b) prototype augmentation, and c) weighted Gaussian aggregation on the server side. Our experiment result shows that the proposed method outperforms the current state of the arts (SOTAs) with a significant improvement (up to 33%) in CIFAR100, MiniImageNet and TinyImageNet datasets. Our extensive analysis demonstrates the robustness of PIP in different task sizes, and the advantage of requiring smaller participating local clients, and smaller global rounds. For further study, source codes of PIP, baseline, and experimental logs are shared publicly in https://github.com/anwarmaxsum/PIP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-user development allows everyday users to tailor service robots or applications to their needs. One user-friendly approach is natural language programming. However, it encounters challenges such as an expansive user expression space and limited support for debugging and editing, which restrict its application in end-user programming. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers promising avenues for the translation and interpretation between human language instructions and the code executed by robots, but their application in end-user programming systems requires further study. We introduce Cocobo, a natural language programming system with interactive diagrams powered by LLMs. Cocobo employs LLMs to understand users' authoring intentions, generate and explain robot programs, and facilitate the conversion between executable code and flowchart representations. Our user study shows that Cocobo has a low learning curve, enabling even users with zero coding experience to customize robot programs successfully.</description>

Abstract: In the past decade, significant strides in deep learning have led to numerous groundbreaking applications. Despite these advancements, the understanding of the high generalizability of deep learning, especially in such an over-parametrized space, remains limited. Successful applications are often considered as empirical rather than scientific achievements. For instance, deep neural networks' (DNNs) internal representations, decision-making mechanism, absence of overfitting in an over-parametrized space, high generalizability, etc., remain less understood. This paper delves into the loss landscape of DNNs through the lens of spin glass in statistical physics, i.e. a system characterized by a complex energy landscape with numerous metastable states, to better understand how DNNs work. We investigated a single hidden layer Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) neural network model, and introduced several protocols to examine the analogy between DNNs (trained with datasets including MNIST and CIFAR10) and spin glass. Specifically, we used (1) random walk in the parameter space of DNNs to unravel the structures in their loss landscape; (2) a permutation-interpolation protocol to study the connection between copies of identical regions in the loss landscape due to the permutation symmetry in the hidden layers; (3) hierarchical clustering to reveal the hierarchy among trained solutions of DNNs, reminiscent of the so-called Replica Symmetry Breaking (RSB) phenomenon (i.e. the Parisi solution) in analogy to spin glass; (4) finally, we examine the relationship between the degree of the ruggedness of the loss landscape of the DNN and its generalizability, showing an improvement of flattened minima.</description>

      <title>Architectural Influence on Variational Quantum Circuits in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Evolutionary Strategies for Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has found application in numerous areas of science and industry, such as autonomous driving, telecommunications, and global health. Nevertheless, MARL suffers from, for instance, an exponential growth of dimensions. Inherent properties of quantum mechanics help to overcome these limitations, e.g., by significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. Previous studies have developed an approach that uses gradient-free quantum Reinforcement Learning and evolutionary optimization for variational quantum circuits (VQCs) to reduce the trainable parameters and avoid barren plateaus as well as vanishing gradients. This leads to a significantly better performance of VQCs compared to classical neural networks with a similar number of trainable parameters and a reduction in the number of parameters by more than 97 \% compared to similarly good neural networks. We extend an approach of K\"olle et al. by proposing a Gate-Based, a Layer-Based, and a Prototype-Based concept to mutate and recombine VQCs. Our results show the best performance for mutation-only strategies and the Gate-Based approach. In particular, we observe a significantly better score, higher total and own collected coins, as well as a superior own coin rate for the best agent when evaluated in the Coin Game environment.</description>

      <title>JaColBERTv2.5: Optimising Multi-Vector Retrievers to Create State-of-the-Art Japanese Retrievers with Constrained Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Information Retrieval has advanced rapidly in high-resource languages, but progress in lower-resource ones such as Japanese has been hindered by data scarcity, among other challenges. Consequently, multilingual models have dominated Japanese retrieval, despite their computational inefficiencies and inability to capture linguistic nuances. While recent multi-vector monolingual models like JaColBERT have narrowed this gap, they still lag behind multilingual methods in large-scale evaluations. This work addresses the suboptimal training methods of multi-vector retrievers in lower-resource settings, focusing on Japanese. We systematically evaluate and improve key aspects of the inference and training settings of JaColBERT, and more broadly, multi-vector models. We further enhance performance through a novel checkpoint merging step, showcasing it to be an effective way of combining the benefits of fine-tuning with the generalization capabilities of the original checkpoint. Building on our analysis, we introduce a novel training recipe, resulting in the JaColBERTv2.5 model. JaColBERTv2.5, with only 110 million parameters and trained in under 15 hours on 4 A100 GPUs, significantly outperforms all existing methods across all common benchmarks, reaching an average score of 0.754, significantly above the previous best of 0.720. To support future research, we make our final models, intermediate checkpoints and all data used publicly available.</description>

Abstract: Quantum one-class support vector machines leverage the advantage of quantum kernel methods for semi-supervised anomaly detection. However, their quadratic time complexity with respect to data size poses challenges when dealing with large datasets. In recent work, quantum randomized measurements kernels and variable subsampling were proposed, as two independent methods to address this problem. The former achieves higher average precision, but suffers from variance, while the latter achieves linear complexity to data size and has lower variance. The current work focuses instead on combining these two methods, along with rotated feature bagging, to achieve linear time complexity both to data size and to number of features. Despite their instability, the resulting models exhibit considerably higher performance and faster training and testing times.</description>

      <title>Cost-Based Semantics for Querying Inconsistent Weighted Knowledge Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a quantitative approach to querying inconsistent description logic knowledge bases. We consider weighted knowledge bases in which both axioms and assertions have (possibly infinite) weights, which are used to assign a cost to each interpretation based upon the axioms and assertions it violates. Two notions of certain and possible answer are defined by either considering interpretations whose cost does not exceed a given bound or restricting attention to optimal-cost interpretations. Our main contribution is a comprehensive analysis of the combined and data complexity of bounded cost satisfiability and certain and possible answer recognition, for description logics between ELbot and ALCO.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Pre-Trained Transformers for Heart Time-Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoder-only transformers are the backbone of the popular generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) series of large language models. In this work, we apply the same framework to periodic heart time-series data to create two pre-trained general purpose cardiac models, namely PPG-PT and ECG-PT. We demonstrate that both such pre-trained models are fully interpretable. This is achieved firstly through aggregate attention maps which show that the model focuses on similar points in previous cardiac cycles in order to make predictions and gradually broadens its attention in deeper layers. Next, tokens with the same value, that occur at different distinct points in the ECG and PPG cycle, form separate clusters in high dimensional space based on their phase as they propagate through the transformer blocks. Finally, we highlight that individual attention heads respond to specific physiologically relevent features, such as the dicrotic notch in PPG and the P-wave in ECG. It is also demonstrated that these pre-trained models can be easily fine-tuned for tasks such as classification of atrial fibrillation. In this specific example, the fine-tuning took 11 minutes of computer time, and achieved a leave-one-subject-out AUCs of 0.99 and 0.93 for ECG and PPG respectively. Importantly, these fine-tuned models are also fully explainable, with attention shifting to regions in the context that are strongly indicative of atrial fibrillation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization is very frequently employed in machine learning. However, an optimization of a large space of parameters could result in overfitting of models. In recent studies on solubility prediction the authors collected seven thermodynamic and kinetic solubility datasets from different data sources. They used state-of-the-art graph-based methods and compared models developed for each dataset using different data cleaning protocols and hyperparameter optimization. In our study we showed that hyperparameter optimization did not always result in better models, possibly due to overfitting when using the same statistical measures. Similar results could be calculated using pre-set hyperparameters, reducing the computational effort by around 10,000 times. We also extended the previous analysis by adding a representation learning method based on Natural Language Processing of smiles called Transformer CNN. We show that across all analyzed sets using exactly the same protocol, Transformer CNN provided better results than graph-based methods for 26 out of 28 pairwise comparisons by using only a tiny fraction of time as compared to other methods. Last but not least we stressed the importance of comparing calculation results using exactly the same statistical measures.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Augmented Agents: A Framework for Efficient Exploration and Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Diffusion Augmented Agents (DAAG), a novel framework that leverages large language models, vision language models, and diffusion models to improve sample efficiency and transfer learning in reinforcement learning for embodied agents. DAAG hindsight relabels the agent's past experience by using diffusion models to transform videos in a temporally and geometrically consistent way to align with target instructions with a technique we call Hindsight Experience Augmentation. A large language model orchestrates this autonomous process without requiring human supervision, making it well-suited for lifelong learning scenarios. The framework reduces the amount of reward-labeled data needed to 1) finetune a vision language model that acts as a reward detector, and 2) train RL agents on new tasks. We demonstrate the sample efficiency gains of DAAG in simulated robotics environments involving manipulation and navigation. Our results show that DAAG improves learning of reward detectors, transferring past experience, and acquiring new tasks - key abilities for developing efficient lifelong learning agents.

      <title>Federated Knowledge Recycling: Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Data Sharing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as a paradigm for collaborative learning, enabling the development of robust models without the need to centralise sensitive data. However, conventional federated learning techniques have privacy and security vulnerabilities due to the exposure of models, parameters or updates, which can be exploited as an attack surface. This paper presents Federated Knowledge Recycling (FedKR), a cross-silo federated learning approach that uses locally generated synthetic data to facilitate collaboration between institutions. FedKR combines advanced data generation techniques with a dynamic aggregation process to provide greater security against privacy attacks than existing methods, significantly reducing the attack surface. Experimental results on generic and medical datasets show that FedKR achieves competitive performance, with an average improvement in accuracy of 4.24% compared to training models from local data, demonstrating particular effectiveness in data scarcity scenarios.</description>

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has opened up new possibilities for applications such as context-driven product recommendations. However, the effectiveness of these models in this context is heavily reliant on their comprehensive understanding of the product inventory. This paper presents a novel approach to equipping LLMs with product knowledge by training them to respond contextually to synthetic search queries that include product IDs. We delve into an extensive analysis of this method, evaluating its effectiveness, outlining its benefits, and highlighting its constraints. The paper also discusses the potential improvements and future directions for this approach, providing a comprehensive understanding of the role of LLMs in product recommendations.</description>

      <title>Effective Black Box Testing of Sentiment Analysis Classification Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis. Nevertheless, the issue of ensuring the dependability of these complicated architectures through comprehensive testing is still open. This paper presents a collection of coverage criteria specifically designed to assess test suites created for transformer-based sentiment analysis networks. Our approach utilizes input space partitioning, a black-box method, by considering emotionally relevant linguistic features such as verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and nouns. In order to effectively produce test cases that encompass a wide range of emotional elements, we utilize the k-projection coverage metric. This metric minimizes the complexity of the problem by examining subsets of k features at the same time, hence reducing dimensionality. Large language models are employed to generate sentences that display specific combinations of emotional features. The findings from experiments obtained from a sentiment analysis dataset illustrate that our criteria and generated tests have led to an average increase of 16\% in test coverage. In addition, there is a corresponding average decrease of 6.5\% in model accuracy, showing the ability to identify vulnerabilities. Our work provides a foundation for improving the dependability of transformer-based sentiment analysis systems through comprehensive test evaluation.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Low-Rank LeArning (Bella): A Practical Approach to Bayesian Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational complexity of Bayesian learning is impeding its adoption in practical, large-scale tasks. Despite demonstrations of significant merits such as improved robustness and resilience to unseen or out-of-distribution inputs over their non- Bayesian counterparts, their practical use has faded to near insignificance. In this study, we introduce an innovative framework to mitigate the computational burden of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). Our approach follows the principle of Bayesian techniques based on deep ensembles, but significantly reduces their cost via multiple low-rank perturbations of parameters arising from a pre-trained neural network. Both vanilla version of ensembles as well as more sophisticated schemes such as Bayesian learning with Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD), previously deemed impractical for large models, can be seamlessly implemented within the proposed framework, called Bayesian Low-Rank LeArning (Bella). In a nutshell, i) Bella achieves a dramatic reduction in the number of trainable parameters required to approximate a Bayesian posterior; and ii) it not only maintains, but in some instances, surpasses the performance of conventional Bayesian learning methods and non-Bayesian baselines. Our results with large-scale tasks such as ImageNet, CAMELYON17, DomainNet, VQA with CLIP, LLaVA demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of Bella in building highly scalable and practical Bayesian deep models for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>MambaCapsule: Towards Transparent Cardiac Disease Diagnosis with Electrocardiography Using Mamba Capsule Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiac arrhythmia, a condition characterized by irregular heartbeats, often serves as an early indication of various heart ailments. With the advent of deep learning, numerous innovative models have been introduced for diagnosing arrhythmias using Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. However, recent studies solely focus on the performance of models, neglecting the interpretation of their results. This leads to a considerable lack of transparency, posing a significant risk in the actual diagnostic process. To solve this problem, this paper introduces MambaCapsule, a deep neural networks for ECG arrhythmias classification, which increases the explainability of the model while enhancing the accuracy.Our model utilizes Mamba for feature extraction and Capsule networks for prediction, providing not only a confidence score but also signal features. Akin to the processing mechanism of human brain, the model learns signal features and their relationship between them by reconstructing ECG signals in the predicted selection. The model evaluation was conducted on MIT-BIH and PTB dataset, following the AAMI standard. MambaCapsule has achieved a total accuracy of 99.54% and 99.59% on the test sets respectively. These results demonstrate the promising performance of under the standard test protocol.</description>

Abstract: Literature research, vital for scientific advancement, is overwhelmed by the vast ocean of available information. Addressing this, we propose an automated review generation method based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline literature processing and reduce cognitive load. In case study on propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts, our method swiftly generated comprehensive reviews from 343 articles, averaging seconds per article per LLM account. Extended analysis of 1041 articles provided deep insights into catalysts' composition, structure, and performance. Recognizing LLMs' hallucinations, we employed a multi-layered quality control strategy, ensuring our method's reliability and effective hallucination mitigation. Expert verification confirms the accuracy and citation integrity of generated reviews, demonstrating LLM hallucination risks reduced to below 0.5% with over 95% confidence. Released Windows application enables one-click review generation, aiding researchers in tracking advancements and recommending literature. This approach showcases LLMs' role in enhancing scientific research productivity and sets the stage for further exploration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the completeness of conjunctive queries over a partially complete database and the approximation of incomplete queries. Given a query and a set of completeness rules (a special kind of tuple generating dependencies) that specify which parts of the database are complete, we investigate whether the query can be fully answered, as if all data were available. If not, we explore reformulating the query into either Maximal Complete Specializations (MCSs) or the (unique up to equivalence) Minimal Complete Generalization (MCG) that can be fully answered, that is, the best complete approximations of the query from below or above in the sense of query containment. We show that the MSG can be characterized as the least fixed-point of a monotonic operator in a preorder. Then, we show that an MCS can be computed by recursive backward application of completeness rules. We study the complexity of both problems and discuss implementation techniques that rely on an ASP and Prolog engines, respectively.</description>

      <title>Emotion-driven Piano Music Generation via Two-stage Disentanglement and Functional Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Managing the emotional aspect remains a challenge in automatic music generation. Prior works aim to learn various emotions at once, leading to inadequate modeling. This paper explores the disentanglement of emotions in piano performance generation through a two-stage framework. The first stage focuses on valence modeling of lead sheet, and the second stage addresses arousal modeling by introducing performance-level attributes. To further capture features that shape valence, an aspect less explored by previous approaches, we introduce a novel functional representation of symbolic music. This representation aims to capture the emotional impact of major-minor tonality, as well as the interactions among notes, chords, and key signatures. Objective and subjective experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework in both emotional valence and arousal modeling. We further leverage our framework in a novel application of emotional controls, showing a broad potential in emotion-driven music generation.</description>

      <title>An Effective Dynamic Gradient Calibration Method for Continual Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) is a fundamental topic in machine learning, where the goal is to train a model with continuously incoming data and tasks. Due to the memory limit, we cannot store all the historical data, and therefore confront the ``catastrophic forgetting'' problem, i.e., the performance on the previous tasks can substantially decrease because of the missing information in the latter period. Though a number of elegant methods have been proposed, the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon still cannot be well avoided in practice. In this paper, we study the problem from the gradient perspective, where our aim is to develop an effective algorithm to calibrate the gradient in each updating step of the model; namely, our goal is to guide the model to be updated in the right direction under the situation that a large amount of historical data are unavailable. Our idea is partly inspired by the seminal stochastic variance reduction methods (e.g., SVRG and SAGA) for reducing the variance of gradient estimation in stochastic gradient descent algorithms. Another benefit is that our approach can be used as a general tool, which is able to be incorporated with several existing popular CL methods to achieve better performance. We also conduct a set of experiments on several benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance in practice.</description>

Abstract: With the advent of Fifth Generation (5G) and Sixth Generation (6G) communication technologies, as well as the Internet of Things (IoT), semantic communication is gaining attention among researchers as current communication technologies are approaching Shannon's limit. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) can understand and generate human-like text, based on extensive training on diverse datasets with billions of parameters. Considering the recent near-source computational technologies like Edge, in this article, we give an overview of a framework along with its modules, where LLMs can be used under the umbrella of semantic communication at the network edge for efficient communication in IoT networks. Finally, we discuss a few applications and analyze the challenges and opportunities to develop such systems.</description>

      <title>MoFO: Momentum-Filtered Optimizer for Mitigating Forgetting in LLM Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of tasks. Typically, an LLM is pre-trained on large corpora and subsequently fine-tuned on task-specific datasets. However, during finetuning, LLMs may forget the knowledge acquired in the pretraining stage, leading to a decline in general capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a new fine-tuning algorithm termed Momentum-Filtered Optimizer (MoFO). The key idea of MoFO is to iteratively select and update the model parameters with the largest momentum magnitudes. Compared to full-parameter training, MoFO achieves similar fine-tuning performance while keeping parameters closer to the pre-trained model, thereby mitigating knowledge forgetting. Unlike most existing methods for forgetting mitigation, MoFO combines the following two advantages. First, MoFO does not require access to pre-training data. This makes MoFO particularly suitable for fine-tuning scenarios where pre-training data is unavailable, such as fine-tuning checkpoint-only open-source LLMs. Second, MoFO does not alter the original loss function. This could avoid impairing the model performance on the fine-tuning tasks. We validate MoFO through rigorous convergence analysis and extensive experiments, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in mitigating forgetting and enhancing fine-tuning performance.</description>

      <title>GABInsight: Exploring Gender-Activity Binding Bias in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are intensively used in many downstream tasks, including those requiring assessments of individuals appearing in the images. While VLMs perform well in simple single-person scenarios, in real-world applications, we often face complex situations in which there are persons of different genders doing different activities. We show that in such cases, VLMs are biased towards identifying the individual with the expected gender (according to ingrained gender stereotypes in the model or other forms of sample selection bias) as the performer of the activity. We refer to this bias in associating an activity with the gender of its actual performer in an image or text as the Gender-Activity Binding (GAB) bias and analyze how this bias is internalized in VLMs. To assess this bias, we have introduced the GAB dataset with approximately 5500 AI-generated images that represent a variety of activities, addressing the scarcity of real-world images for some scenarios. To have extensive quality control, the generated images are evaluated for their diversity, quality, and realism. We have tested 12 renowned pre-trained VLMs on this dataset in the context of text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval to measure the effect of this bias on their predictions. Additionally, we have carried out supplementary experiments to quantify the bias in VLMs' text encoders and to evaluate VLMs' capability to recognize activities. Our experiments indicate that VLMs experience an average performance decline of about 13.2% when confronted with gender-activity binding bias.</description>

      <title>XHand: Real-time Expressive Hand Avatar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hand avatars play a pivotal role in a wide array of digital interfaces, enhancing user immersion and facilitating natural interaction within virtual environments. While previous studies have focused on photo-realistic hand rendering, little attention has been paid to reconstruct the hand geometry with fine details, which is essential to rendering quality. In the realms of extended reality and gaming, on-the-fly rendering becomes imperative. To this end, we introduce an expressive hand avatar, named XHand, that is designed to comprehensively generate hand shape, appearance, and deformations in real-time. To obtain fine-grained hand meshes, we make use of three feature embedding modules to predict hand deformation displacements, albedo, and linear blending skinning weights, respectively. To achieve photo-realistic hand rendering on fine-grained meshes, our method employs a mesh-based neural renderer by leveraging mesh topological consistency and latent codes from embedding modules. During training, a part-aware Laplace smoothing strategy is proposed by incorporating the distinct levels of regularization to effectively maintain the necessary details and eliminate the undesired artifacts. The experimental evaluations on InterHand2.6M and DeepHandMesh datasets demonstrate the efficacy of XHand, which is able to recover high-fidelity geometry and texture for hand animations across diverse poses in real-time. To reproduce our results, we will make the full implementation publicly available at https://github.com/agnJason/XHand.</description>

      <title>CLEFT: Language-Image Contrastive Learning with Efficient Large Language Model and Prompt Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) have demonstrated notable success in self-supervised representation learning across various tasks. However, the existing CLIP-like approaches often demand extensive GPU resources and prolonged training times due to the considerable size of the model and dataset, making them poor for medical applications, in which large datasets are not always common. Meanwhile, the language model prompts are mainly manually derived from labels tied to images, potentially overlooking the richness of information within training samples. We introduce a novel language-image Contrastive Learning method with an Efficient large language model and prompt Fine-Tuning (CLEFT) that harnesses the strengths of the extensive pre-trained language and visual models. Furthermore, we present an efficient strategy for learning context-based prompts that mitigates the gap between informative clinical diagnostic data and simple class labels. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple chest X-ray and mammography datasets compared with various baselines. The proposed parameter efficient framework can reduce the total trainable model size by 39% and reduce the trainable language model to only 4% compared with the current BERT encoder.</description>

      <title>ThinK: Thinner Key Cache by Query-Driven Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, achieving unprecedented performance across a variety of applications by leveraging increased model sizes and sequence lengths. However, the associated rise in computational and memory costs poses significant challenges, particularly in managing long sequences due to the quadratic complexity of the transformer attention mechanism. This paper focuses on the long-context scenario, addressing the inefficiencies in KV cache memory consumption during inference. Unlike existing approaches that optimize the memory based on the sequence lengths, we uncover that the channel dimension of the KV cache exhibits significant redundancy, characterized by unbalanced magnitude distribution and low-rank structure in attention weights. Based on these observations, we propose ThinK, a novel query-dependent KV cache pruning method designed to minimize attention weight loss while selectively pruning the least significant channels. Our approach not only maintains or enhances model accuracy but also achieves a reduction in memory costs by over 20% compared with vanilla KV cache eviction methods. Extensive evaluations on the LLaMA3 and Mistral models across various long-sequence datasets confirm the efficacy of ThinK, setting a new precedent for efficient LLM deployment without compromising performance. We also outline the potential of extending our method to value cache pruning, demonstrating ThinK's versatility and broad applicability in reducing both memory and computational overheads.</description>

Abstract: We describe the constraint modelling tool Savile Row, its input language and its main features. Savile Row translates a solver-independent constraint modelling language to the input languages for various solvers including constraint, SAT, and SMT solvers. After a brief introduction, the manual describes the Essence Prime language, which is the input language of Savile Row. Then we describe the functions of the tool, its main features and options and how to install and use it.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Pedestrian Safety in a High-Fidelity Simulation Environment Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08731v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pedestrians' safety is a crucial factor in assessing autonomous driving scenarios. However, pedestrian safety evaluation is rarely considered by existing autonomous driving simulation platforms. This paper proposes a pedestrian safety evaluation method for autonomous driving, in which not only the collision events but also the conflict events together with the characteristics of pedestrians are fully considered. Moreover, to apply the pedestrian safety evaluation system, we construct a high-fidelity simulation framework embedded with pedestrian safety-critical characteristics. We demonstrate our simulation framework and pedestrian safety evaluation with a comparative experiment with two kinds of autonomous driving perception algorithms -- single-vehicle perception and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) cooperative perception. The results show that our framework can evaluate different autonomous driving algorithms with detailed and quantitative pedestrian safety indexes. To this end, the proposed simulation method and framework can be used to access different autonomous driving algorithms and evaluate pedestrians' safety performance in future autonomous driving simulations, which can inspire more pedestrian-friendly autonomous driving algorithms.</description>

      <title>Validation of the Practicability of Logical Assessment Formula for Evaluations with Inaccurate Ground-Truth Labels: An Application Study on Tumour Segmentation for Breast Cancer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The logical assessment formula (LAF) is a new theory proposed for evaluations with inaccurate ground-truth labels (IAGTLs) to assess the predictive models for artificial intelligence applications. However, the practicability of LAF for evaluations with IAGTLs has not yet been validated in real-world practice. In this paper, we applied LAF to two tasks of tumour segmentation for breast cancer (TSfBC) in medical histopathology whole slide image analysis (MHWSIA) for evaluations with IAGTLs. Experimental results and analysis show that the LAF-based evaluations with IAGTLs were unable to confidently act like usual evaluations with accurate ground-truth labels on the one easier task of TSfBC while being able to reasonably act like usual evaluations with AGTLs on the other more difficult task of TSfBC. These results and analysis reflect the potential of LAF applied to MHWSIA for evaluations with IAGTLs. This paper presents the first practical validation of LAF for evaluations with IAGTLs in a real-world application.</description>

      <title>PlotMap: Automated Layout Design for Building Game Worlds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: World-building, the process of developing both the narrative and physical world of a game, plays a vital role in the game's experience. Critically-acclaimed independent and AAA video games are praised for strong world-building, with game maps that masterfully intertwine with and elevate the narrative, captivating players and leaving a lasting impression. However, designing game maps that support a desired narrative is challenging, as it requires satisfying complex constraints from various considerations. Most existing map generation methods focus on considerations about gameplay mechanics or map topography, while the need to support the story is typically neglected. As a result, extensive manual adjustment is still required to design a game world that facilitates particular stories. In this work, we approach this problem by introducing an extra layer of plot facility layout design that is independent of the underlying map generation method in a world-building pipeline.
  Concretely, we define (plot) facility layout tasks as the tasks of assigning concrete locations on a game map to abstract locations mentioned in a given story (plot facilities), following spatial constraints derived from the story. We present two methods for solving these tasks automatically: an evolutionary computation based approach through Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), and a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach. We develop a method of generating datasets of facility layout tasks, create a gym-like environment for experimenting with and evaluating different methods, and further analyze the two methods with comprehensive experiments, aiming to provide insights for solving facility layout tasks. We will release the code and a dataset containing 10, 000 tasks of different scales.</description>

      <title>C-RAG: Certified Generation Risks for Retrieval-Augmented Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03181v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across diverse applications, they still suffer from trustworthiness issues, such as hallucinations and misalignments. Retrieval-augmented language models (RAG) have been proposed to enhance the credibility of generations by grounding external knowledge, but the theoretical understandings of their generation risks remains unexplored. In this paper, we answer: 1) whether RAG can indeed lead to low generation risks, 2) how to provide provable guarantees on the generation risks of RAG and vanilla LLMs, and 3) what sufficient conditions enable RAG models to reduce generation risks. We propose C-RAG, the first framework to certify generation risks for RAG models. Specifically, we provide conformal risk analysis for RAG models and certify an upper confidence bound of generation risks, which we refer to as conformal generation risk. We also provide theoretical guarantees on conformal generation risks for general bounded risk functions under test distribution shifts. We prove that RAG achieves a lower conformal generation risk than that of a single LLM when the quality of the retrieval model and transformer is non-trivial. Our intensive empirical results demonstrate the soundness and tightness of our conformal generation risk guarantees across four widely-used NLP datasets on four state-of-the-art retrieval models.</description>

Abstract: Building an intelligent and efficient medical assistant is still a challenging AI problem. The major limitation comes from the data modality scarceness, which reduces comprehensive patient perception. This demo paper presents the GigaPevt, the first multimodal medical assistant that combines the dialog capabilities of large language models with specialized medical models. Such an approach shows immediate advantages in dialog quality and metric performance, with a 1.18% accuracy improvement in the question-answering task.</description>

Abstract: The study of cooperation within social dilemmas has long been a fundamental topic across various disciplines, including computer science and social science. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have significantly reshaped this field, offering fresh insights into understanding and enhancing cooperation. This survey examines three key areas at the intersection of AI and cooperation in social dilemmas. First, focusing on multi-agent cooperation, we review the intrinsic and external motivations that support cooperation among rational agents, and the methods employed to develop effective strategies against diverse opponents. Second, looking into human-agent cooperation, we discuss the current AI algorithms for cooperating with humans and the human biases towards AI agents. Third, we review the emergent field of leveraging AI agents to enhance cooperation among humans. We conclude by discussing future research avenues, such as using large language models, establishing unified theoretical frameworks, revisiting existing theories of human cooperation, and exploring multiple real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Learn from Failure: Fine-Tuning LLMs with Trial-and-Error Data for Intuitionistic Propositional Logic Proving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Automated Theorem Proving have shown the effectiveness of leveraging a (large) language model that generates tactics (i.e. proof steps) to search through proof states. The current model, while trained solely on successful proof paths, faces a discrepancy at the inference stage, as it must sample and try various tactics at each proof state until finding success, unlike its training which does not incorporate learning from failed attempts. Intuitively, a tactic that leads to a failed search path would indicate that similar tactics should receive less attention during the following trials. In this paper, we demonstrate the benefit of training models that additionally learn from failed search paths. Facing the lack of such trial-and-error data in existing open-source theorem-proving datasets, we curate a dataset on intuitionistic propositional logic theorems and formalize it in Lean, such that we can reliably check the correctness of proofs. We compare our model trained on relatively short trial-and-error information (TrialMaster) with models trained only on the correct paths and discover that the former solves more unseen theorems with lower trial searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The progress of humanity is driven by those successful discoveries accompanied by countless failed experiments. Researchers often seek the potential research directions by reading and then verifying them through experiments. The process imposes a significant burden on researchers. In the past decade, the data-driven black-box deep learning method has demonstrated its effectiveness in a wide range of real-world scenarios, which exacerbates the experimental burden of researchers and thus renders the potential successful discoveries veiled. Therefore, automating such a research and development (R&amp;D) process is an urgent need. In this paper, we serve as the first effort to formalize the goal by proposing a Real-world Data-centric automatic R&amp;D Benchmark, namely RD2Bench. RD2Bench benchmarks all the operations in data-centric automatic R&amp;D (D-CARD) as a whole to navigate future work toward our goal directly. We focus on evaluating the interaction and synergistic effects of various model capabilities and aiding in selecting well-performing trustworthy models. Although RD2Bench is very challenging to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language model (LLM) named GPT-4, indicating ample research opportunities and more research efforts, LLMs possess promising potential to bring more significant development to D-CARD: They are able to implement some simple methods without adopting any additional techniques. We appeal to future work to take developing techniques for tackling automatic R&amp;D into consideration, thus bringing the opportunities of the potential revolutionary upgrade to human productivity.</description>

      <title>MFE-ETP: A Comprehensive Evaluation Benchmark for Multi-modal Foundation Models on Embodied Task Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Multi-modal Foundation Models (MFMs) and Embodied Artificial Intelligence (EAI) have been advancing side by side at an unprecedented pace. The integration of the two has garnered significant attention from the AI research community. In this work, we attempt to provide an in-depth and comprehensive evaluation of the performance of MFM s on embodied task planning, aiming to shed light on their capabilities and limitations in this domain. To this end, based on the characteristics of embodied task planning, we first develop a systematic evaluation framework, which encapsulates four crucial capabilities of MFMs: object understanding, spatio-temporal perception, task understanding, and embodied reasoning. Following this, we propose a new benchmark, named MFE-ETP, characterized its complex and variable task scenarios, typical yet diverse task types, task instances of varying difficulties, and rich test case types ranging from multiple embodied question answering to embodied task reasoning. Finally, we offer a simple and easy-to-use automatic evaluation platform that enables the automated testing of multiple MFMs on the proposed benchmark. Using the benchmark and evaluation platform, we evaluated several state-of-the-art MFMs and found that they significantly lag behind human-level performance. The MFE-ETP is a high-quality, large-scale, and challenging benchmark relevant to real-world tasks.</description>

      <title>On the Limitations of Compute Thresholds as a Governance Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At face value, this essay is about understanding a fairly esoteric governance tool called compute thresholds. However, in order to grapple with whether these thresholds will achieve anything, we must first understand how they came to be. To do so, we need to engage with a decades-old debate at the heart of computer science progress, namely, is bigger always better? Does a certain inflection point of compute result in changes to the risk profile of a model? Hence, this essay may be of interest not only to policymakers and the wider public but also to computer scientists interested in understanding the role of compute in unlocking breakthroughs. This discussion is timely given the wide adoption of compute thresholds in both the White House Executive Orders on AI Safety (EO) and the EU AI Act to identify more risky systems. A key conclusion of this essay is that compute thresholds, as currently implemented, are shortsighted and likely to fail to mitigate risk. The relationship between compute and risk is highly uncertain and rapidly changing. Relying upon compute thresholds overestimates our ability to predict what abilities emerge at different scales. This essay ends with recommendations for a better way forward.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have increased the demand for comprehensive benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities as human-like agents. Existing benchmarks, while useful, often focus on specific application scenarios, emphasizing task completion but failing to dissect the underlying skills that drive these outcomes. This lack of granularity makes it difficult to deeply discern where failures stem from. Additionally, setting up these environments requires considerable effort, and issues of unreliability and reproducibility sometimes arise, especially in interactive tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce the Massive Multitask Agent Understanding (MMAU) benchmark, featuring comprehensive offline tasks that eliminate the need for complex environment setups. It evaluates models across five domains, including Tool-use, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) QA, Data Science and Machine Learning coding, Contest-level programming and Mathematics, and covers five essential capabilities: Understanding, Reasoning, Planning, Problem-solving, and Self-correction. With a total of 20 meticulously designed tasks encompassing over 3K distinct prompts, MMAU provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the strengths and limitations of LLM agents. By testing 18 representative models on MMAU, we provide deep and insightful analyses. Ultimately, MMAU not only sheds light on the capabilities and limitations of LLM agents but also enhances the interpretability of their performance. Datasets and evaluation scripts of MMAU are released at https://github.com/apple/axlearn/tree/main/docs/research/mmau.</description>

Abstract: Causal learning has garnered significant attention in recent years because it reveals the essential relationships that underpin phenomena and delineates the mechanisms by which the world evolves. Nevertheless, traditional causal learning methods face numerous challenges and limitations, including high-dimensional, unstructured variables, combinatorial optimization problems, unobserved confounders, selection biases, and estimation inaccuracies. Deep causal learning, which leverages deep neural networks, offers innovative insights and solutions for addressing these challenges. Although numerous deep learning-based methods for causal discovery and inference have been proposed, there remains a dearth of reviews examining the underlying mechanisms by which deep learning can enhance causal learning. In this article, we comprehensively review how deep learning can contribute to causal learning by tackling traditional challenges across three key dimensions: representation, discovery, and inference. We emphasize that deep causal learning is pivotal for advancing the theoretical frontiers and broadening the practical applications of causal science. We conclude by summarizing open issues and outlining potential directions for future research.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving a wide range of problems, including medical decision-making. The exponential growth of medical data over the past two decades has surpassed the capacity for manual analysis, prompting increased interest in automated data analysis and processing. ML algorithms, capable of learning from data with minimal human intervention, are particularly well-suited for medical data analysis and interpretation. One significant advantage of ML is the reduced cost of collecting labeled training data necessary for supervised learning. While numerous studies have explored the applications of ML in medicine, this survey specifically focuses on the use of ML across various medical research fields. We provide a comprehensive technical overview of existing studies on ML applications in medicine, highlighting the strengths and limitations of these approaches. Additionally, we discuss potential research directions for future exploration. These include the development of more sophisticated reward functions, as the accuracy of the reward function is crucial for ML performance, the integration of ML with other techniques, and the application of ML to new and emerging areas in genomics research. Finally, we summarize our findings and present the current state of the field and the future outlook for ML in medical application.</description>

      <title>Direct Preference Optimization: Your Language Model is Secretly a Reward Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18290v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large-scale unsupervised language models (LMs) learn broad world knowledge and some reasoning skills, achieving precise control of their behavior is difficult due to the completely unsupervised nature of their training. Existing methods for gaining such steerability collect human labels of the relative quality of model generations and fine-tune the unsupervised LM to align with these preferences, often with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, RLHF is a complex and often unstable procedure, first fitting a reward model that reflects the human preferences, and then fine-tuning the large unsupervised LM using reinforcement learning to maximize this estimated reward without drifting too far from the original model. In this paper we introduce a new parameterization of the reward model in RLHF that enables extraction of the corresponding optimal policy in closed form, allowing us to solve the standard RLHF problem with only a simple classification loss. The resulting algorithm, which we call Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), is stable, performant, and computationally lightweight, eliminating the need for sampling from the LM during fine-tuning or performing significant hyperparameter tuning. Our experiments show that DPO can fine-tune LMs to align with human preferences as well as or better than existing methods. Notably, fine-tuning with DPO exceeds PPO-based RLHF in ability to control sentiment of generations, and matches or improves response quality in summarization and single-turn dialogue while being substantially simpler to implement and train.</description>

      <title>SMARLA: A Safety Monitoring Approach for Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning algorithms (DRL) are increasingly being used in safety-critical systems. Ensuring the safety of DRL agents is a critical concern in such contexts. However, relying solely on testing is not sufficient to ensure safety as it does not offer guarantees. Building safety monitors is one solution to alleviate this challenge. This paper proposes SMARLA, a machine learning-based safety monitoring approach designed for DRL agents. For practical reasons, SMARLA is agnostic to the type of DRL agent's inputs. Further, it is designed to be black-box (as it does not require access to the internals or training data of the agent) by leveraging state abstraction to facilitate the learning of safety violation prediction models from the agent's states using a reduced state space. We quantitatively and qualitatively validated SMARLA on three well-known RL case studies. Empirical results reveal that SMARLA achieves accurate violation prediction with a low false positive rate and can predict safety violations at an early stage, approximately halfway through the execution of the agent, before violations occur.</description>

      <title>The Responsible Development of Automated Student Feedback with Generative AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contribution: This paper identifies four critical ethical considerations for implementing generative AI tools to provide automated feedback to students.
  Background: Providing rich feedback to students is essential for supporting student learning. Recent advances in generative AI, particularly with large language models (LLMs), provide the opportunity to deliver repeatable, scalable and instant automatically generated feedback to students, making abundant a previously scarce and expensive learning resource. Such an approach is feasible from a technical perspective due to these recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP); while the potential upside is a strong motivator, doing so introduces a range of potential ethical issues that must be considered as we apply these technologies.
  Intended Outcomes: The goal of this work is to enable the use of AI systems to automate mundane assessment and feedback tasks, without introducing a "tyranny of the majority", where the needs of minorities in the long tail are overlooked because they are difficult to automate.
  Application Design: This paper applies an extant ethical framework used for AI and machine learning to the specific challenge of providing automated feedback to student engineers. The task is considered from both a development and maintenance perspective, considering how automated feedback tools will evolve and be used over time.
  Findings: This paper identifies four key ethical considerations for the implementation of automated feedback for students: Participation, Development, Impact on Learning and Evolution over Time.</description>

      <title>Semantic Image Synthesis via Class-Adaptive Cross-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In semantic image synthesis the state of the art is dominated by methods that use customized variants of the SPatially-Adaptive DE-normalization (SPADE) layers, which allow for good visual generation quality and editing versatility. By design, such layers learn pixel-wise modulation parameters to de-normalize the generator activations based on the semantic class each pixel belongs to. Thus, they tend to overlook global image statistics, ultimately leading to unconvincing local style editing and causing global inconsistencies such as color or illumination distribution shifts. Also, SPADE layers require the semantic segmentation mask for mapping styles in the generator, preventing shape manipulations without manual intervention. In response, we designed a novel architecture where cross-attention layers are used in place of SPADE for learning shape-style correlations and so conditioning the image generation process. Our model inherits the versatility of SPADE, at the same time obtaining state-of-the-art generation quality, as well as improved global and local style transfer.

      <title>DOMAIN: MilDly COnservative Model-BAsed OfflINe Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08925v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (RL), which learns environment model from offline dataset and generates more out-of-distribution model data, has become an effective approach to the problem of distribution shift in offline RL. Due to the gap between the learned and actual environment, conservatism should be incorporated into the algorithm to balance accurate offline data and imprecise model data. The conservatism of current algorithms mostly relies on model uncertainty estimation. However, uncertainty estimation is unreliable and leads to poor performance in certain scenarios, and the previous methods ignore differences between the model data, which brings great conservatism. Therefore, this paper proposes a milDly cOnservative Model-bAsed offlINe RL algorithm (DOMAIN) without estimating model uncertainty to address the above issues. DOMAIN introduces adaptive sampling distribution of model samples, which can adaptively adjust the model data penalty. In this paper, we theoretically demonstrate that the Q value learned by the DOMAIN outside the region is a lower bound of the true Q value, the DOMAIN is less conservative than previous model-based offline RL algorithms and has the guarantee of safety policy improvement. The results of extensive experiments show that DOMAIN outperforms prior RL algorithms on the D4RL dataset benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately forecasting the motion of traffic actors is crucial for the deployment of autonomous vehicles at a large scale. Current trajectory forecasting approaches primarily concentrate on optimizing a loss function with a specific metric, which can result in predictions that do not adhere to physical laws or violate external constraints. Our objective is to incorporate explicit knowledge priors that allow a network to forecast future trajectories in compliance with both the kinematic constraints of a vehicle and the geometry of the driving environment. To achieve this, we introduce a non-parametric pruning layer and attention layers to integrate the defined knowledge priors. Our proposed method is designed to ensure reachability guarantees for traffic actors in both complex and dynamic situations. By conditioning the network to follow physical laws, we can obtain accurate and safe predictions, essential for maintaining autonomous vehicles' safety and efficiency in real-world settings.In summary, this paper presents concepts that prevent off-road predictions for safe and reliable motion forecasting by incorporating knowledge priors into the training process.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Scalable Representation for Graph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in employing neural networks for graph generation, a fundamental statistical learning problem with critical applications like molecule design and community analysis. However, most approaches encounter significant limitations when generating large-scale graphs. This is due to their requirement to output the full adjacency matrices whose size grows quadratically with the number of nodes. In response to this challenge, we introduce a new, simple, and scalable graph representation named gap encoded edge list (GEEL) that has a small representation size that aligns with the number of edges. In addition, GEEL significantly reduces the vocabulary size by incorporating the gap encoding and bandwidth restriction schemes. GEEL can be autoregressively generated with the incorporation of node positional encoding, and we further extend GEEL to deal with attributed graphs by designing a new grammar. Our findings reveal that the adoption of this compact representation not only enhances scalability but also bolsters performance by simplifying the graph generation process. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across ten non-attributed and two molecular graph generation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of GEEL.</description>

      <title>Chain of Code: Reasoning with a Language Model-Augmented Code Emulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04474v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Code provides a general syntactic structure to build complex programs and perform precise computations when paired with a code interpreter - we hypothesize that language models (LMs) can leverage code-writing to improve Chain of Thought reasoning not only for logic and arithmetic tasks, but also for semantic ones (and in particular, those that are a mix of both). For example, consider prompting an LM to write code that counts the number of times it detects sarcasm in an essay: the LM may struggle to write an implementation for "detect_sarcasm(string)" that can be executed by the interpreter (handling the edge cases would be insurmountable). However, LMs may still produce a valid solution if they not only write code, but also selectively "emulate" the interpreter by generating the expected output of "detect_sarcasm(string)". In this work, we propose Chain of Code (CoC), a simple yet surprisingly effective extension that improves LM code-driven reasoning. The key idea is to encourage LMs to format semantic sub-tasks in a program as flexible pseudocode that the interpreter can explicitly catch undefined behaviors and hand off to simulate with an LM (as an "LMulator"). Experiments demonstrate that Chain of Code outperforms Chain of Thought and other baselines across a variety of benchmarks; on BIG-Bench Hard, Chain of Code achieves 84%, a gain of 12% over Chain of Thought. In a nutshell, CoC broadens the scope of reasoning questions that LMs can answer by "thinking in code".</description>

      <title>ROSE: A Recognition-Oriented Speech Enhancement Framework in Air Traffic Control Using Multi-Objective Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radio speech echo is a specific phenomenon in the air traffic control (ATC) domain, which degrades speech quality and further impacts automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy. In this work, a time-domain recognition-oriented speech enhancement (ROSE) framework is proposed to improve speech intelligibility and also advance ASR accuracy based on convolutional encoder-decoder-based U-Net framework, which serves as a plug-and-play tool in ATC scenarios and does not require additional retraining of the ASR model. Specifically, 1) In the U-Net architecture, an attention-based skip-fusion (ABSF) module is applied to mine shared features from encoders using an attention mask, which enables the model to effectively fuse the hierarchical features. 2) A channel and sequence attention (CSAtt) module is innovatively designed to guide the model to focus on informative features in dual parallel attention paths, aiming to enhance the effective representations and suppress the interference noises. 3) Based on the handcrafted features, ASR-oriented optimization targets are designed to improve recognition performance in the ATC environment by learning robust feature representations. By incorporating both the SE-oriented and ASR-oriented losses, ROSE is implemented in a multi-objective learning manner by optimizing shared representations across the two task objectives. The experimental results show that the ROSE significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for both the SE and ASR tasks, in which all the proposed improvements are confirmed by designed experiments. In addition, the proposed approach can contribute to the desired performance improvements on public datasets.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Spiking Framework for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is gradually attracting attention due to the low power consumption and high efficiency in processing the non-Euclidean data represented by graphs. However, as a common problem, dynamic graph representation learning faces challenges such as high complexity and large memory overheads. Current work often uses SNNs instead of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) by using binary features instead of continuous ones for efficient training, which would overlooks graph structure information and leads to the loss of details during propagation. Additionally, optimizing dynamic spiking models typically requires propagation of information across time steps, which increases memory requirements. To address these challenges, we present a framework named \underline{Dy}namic \underline{S}p\underline{i}king \underline{G}raph \underline{N}eural Networks (\method{}). To mitigate the information loss problem, \method{} propagates early-layer information directly to the last layer for information compensation. To accommodate the memory requirements, we apply the implicit differentiation on the equilibrium state, which does not rely on the exact reverse of the forward computation. While traditional implicit differentiation methods are usually used for static situations, \method{} extends it to the dynamic graph setting. Extensive experiments on three large-scale real-world dynamic graph datasets validate the effectiveness of \method{} on dynamic node classification tasks with lower computational costs.</description>

      <title>Between Lines of Code: Unraveling the Distinct Patterns of Machine and Human Programmers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06461v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have catalyzed an unprecedented wave in code generation. While achieving significant advances, they blur the distinctions between machine- and human-authored source code, causing integrity and authenticity issues of software artifacts. Previous methods such as DetectGPT have proven effective in discerning machine-generated texts, but they do not identify and harness the unique patterns of machine-generated code. Thus, its applicability falters when applied to code. In this paper, we carefully study the specific patterns that characterize machine- and human-authored code. Through a rigorous analysis of code attributes such as lexical diversity, conciseness, and naturalness, we expose unique patterns inherent to each source. We particularly notice that the syntactic segmentation of code is a critical factor in identifying its provenance. Based on our findings, we propose DetectCodeGPT, a novel method for detecting machine-generated code, which improves DetectGPT by capturing the distinct stylized patterns of code. Diverging from conventional techniques that depend on external LLMs for perturbations, DetectCodeGPT perturbs the code corpus by strategically inserting spaces and newlines, ensuring both efficacy and efficiency. Experiment results show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detecting machine-generated code.</description>

      <title>Can we Constrain Concept Bottleneck Models to Learn Semantically Meaningful Input Features?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) are regarded as inherently interpretable because they first predict a set of human-defined concepts which are used to predict a task label. For inherent interpretability to be fully realised, and ensure trust in a model's output, it's desirable for concept predictions to use semantically meaningful input features. For instance, in an image, pixels representing a broken bone should contribute to predicting a fracture. However, current literature suggests that concept predictions often rely on irrelevant input features. We hypothesise that this occurs when dataset labels include inaccurate concept annotations, or the relationship between input features and concepts is unclear. In general, the effect of dataset labelling on concept representations remains an understudied area. In this paper, we demonstrate that CBMs can learn to map concepts to semantically meaningful input features, by utilising datasets with a clear link between the input features and the desired concept predictions. This is achieved, for instance, by ensuring multiple concepts do not always co-occur and, therefore provide a clear training signal for the CBM to distinguish the relevant input features for each concept. We validate our hypothesis on both synthetic and real-world image datasets, and demonstrate under the correct conditions, CBMs can learn to attribute semantically meaningful input features to the correct concept predictions.</description>

      <title>GenNBV: Generalizable Next-Best-View Policy for Active 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While recent advances in neural radiance field enable realistic digitization for large-scale scenes, the image-capturing process is still time-consuming and labor-intensive. Previous works attempt to automate this process using the Next-Best-View (NBV) policy for active 3D reconstruction. However, the existing NBV policies heavily rely on hand-crafted criteria, limited action space, or per-scene optimized representations. These constraints limit their cross-dataset generalizability. To overcome them, we propose GenNBV, an end-to-end generalizable NBV policy. Our policy adopts a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework and extends typical limited action space to 5D free space. It empowers our agent drone to scan from any viewpoint, and even interact with unseen geometries during training. To boost the cross-dataset generalizability, we also propose a novel multi-source state embedding, including geometric, semantic, and action representations. We establish a benchmark using the Isaac Gym simulator with the Houses3K and OmniObject3D datasets to evaluate this NBV policy. Experiments demonstrate that our policy achieves a 98.26% and 97.12% coverage ratio on unseen building-scale objects from these datasets, respectively, outperforming prior solutions.</description>

      <title>Particip-AI: Anticipating Future AI Use Cases and Impacts with Lay Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14791v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General purpose AI, such as ChatGPT, seems to have lowered the barriers for the public to use AI and harness its power. However, the governance and development of AI still remain in the hands of a few, and the pace of development is accelerating without a comprehensive assessment of risks. As a first step towards democratic risk assessment and design of general purpose AI, we introduce PARTICIP-AI, a carefully designed framework for laypeople to speculate and assess AI use cases and their impacts. Our framework allows us to study more nuanced and detailed public opinions on AI through collecting use cases, surfacing diverse harms through risk assessment under alternate scenarios (i.e., developing and not developing a use case), and illuminating tensions over AI development through making a concluding choice on its development. To showcase the promise of our framework towards informing democratic AI development, we run a medium-scale study with inputs from 295 demographically diverse participants. Our analyses show that participants' responses emphasize applications for personal life and society, contrasting with most current AI development's business focus. We also surface diverse set of envisioned harms such as distrust in AI and institutions, complementary to those defined by experts. Furthermore, we found that perceived impact of not developing use cases significantly predicted participants' judgements of whether AI use cases should be developed, and highlighted lay users' concerns of techno-solutionism. We conclude with a discussion on how frameworks like PARTICIP-AI can further guide democratic AI development and governance.</description>

      <title>SceneX:Procedural Controllable Large-scale Scene Generation via Large-language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to its great application potential, large-scale scene generation has drawn extensive attention in academia and industry. Recent research employs powerful generative models to create desired scenes and achieves promising results. However, most of these methods represent the scene using 3D primitives (e.g. point cloud or radiance field) incompatible with the industrial pipeline, which leads to a substantial gap between academic research and industrial deployment. Procedural Controllable Generation (PCG) is an efficient technique for creating scalable and high-quality assets, but it is unfriendly for ordinary users as it demands profound domain expertise. To address these issues, we resort to using the large language model (LLM) to drive the procedural modeling. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale scene generation framework, SceneX, which can automatically produce high-quality procedural models according to designers' textual descriptions.Specifically, the proposed method comprises two components, PCGBench and PCGPlanner. The former encompasses an extensive collection of accessible procedural assets and thousands of hand-craft API documents. The latter aims to generate executable actions for Blender to produce controllable and precise 3D assets guided by the user's instructions. Our SceneX can generate a city spanning 2.5 km times 2.5 km with delicate layout and geometric structures, drastically reducing the time cost from several weeks for professional PCG engineers to just a few hours for an ordinary user. Extensive experiments demonstrated the capability of our method in controllable large-scale scene generation and editing, including asset placement and season translation.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary task demands mask the capabilities of smaller language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developmental psychologists have argued about when cognitive capacities such as language understanding or theory of mind emerge. These debates often hinge on the concept of "task demands" -- the auxiliary challenges associated with performing a particular evaluation -- that may mask the child's underlying ability. The same issues arise when measuring the capacities of language models (LMs): performance on a task is a function of the model's underlying knowledge, combined with the model's ability to interpret and perform the task given its available resources. Here, we show that for analogical reasoning, reflective reasoning, word prediction, and grammaticality judgments, evaluation methods with greater task demands yield lower performance than evaluations with reduced demands. This "demand gap" is most pronounced for models with fewer parameters and less training data. Our results illustrate that LM performance should not be interpreted as a direct indication of intelligence (or lack thereof), but as a reflection of capacities seen through the lens of researchers' design choices.</description>

      <title>Robust Federated Learning for Wireless Networks: A Demonstration with Channel Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving collaborative approach for training models in wireless networks, with channel estimation emerging as a promising application. Despite extensive studies on FL-empowered channel estimation, the security concerns associated with FL require meticulous attention. In a scenario where small base stations (SBSs) serve as local models trained on cached data, and a macro base station (MBS) functions as the global model setting, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability of FL, launching attacks with various adversarial attacks or deployment tactics. In this paper, we analyze such vulnerabilities, corresponding solutions were brought forth, and validated through simulation.</description>

      <title>A Symmetric Regressor for MRI-Based Assessment of Striatal Dopamine Transporter Uptake in Parkinson's Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging is commonly used for monitoring Parkinson's disease (PD), where striatal DAT uptake amount is computed to assess PD severity. However, DAT imaging has a high cost and the risk of radiance exposure and is not available in general clinics. Recently, MRI patch of the nigral region has been proposed as a safer and easier alternative. This paper proposes a symmetric regressor for predicting the DAT uptake amount from the nigral MRI patch. Acknowledging the symmetry between the right and left nigrae, the proposed regressor incorporates a paired input-output model that simultaneously predicts the DAT uptake amounts for both the right and left striata. Moreover, it employs a symmetric loss that imposes a constraint on the difference between right-to-left predictions, resembling the high correlation in DAT uptake amounts in the two lateral sides. Additionally, we propose a symmetric Monte-Carlo (MC) dropout method for providing a fruitful uncertainty estimate of the DAT uptake prediction, which utilizes the above symmetry. We evaluated the proposed approach on 734 nigral patches, which demonstrated significantly improved performance of the symmetric regressor compared with the standard regressors while giving better explainability and feature representation. The symmetric MC dropout also gave precise uncertainty ranges with a high probability of including the true DAT uptake amounts within the range.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Imitation Learning Methods, Environments and Metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning is an approach in which an agent learns how to execute a task by trying to mimic how one or more teachers perform it. This learning approach offers a compromise between the time it takes to learn a new task and the effort needed to collect teacher samples for the agent. It achieves this by balancing learning from the teacher, who has some information on how to perform the task, and deviating from their examples when necessary, such as states not present in the teacher samples. Consequently, the field of imitation learning has received much attention from researchers in recent years, resulting in many new methods and applications. However, with this increase in published work and past surveys focusing mainly on methodology, a lack of standardisation became more prominent in the field. This non-standardisation is evident in the use of environments, which appear in no more than two works, and evaluation processes, such as qualitative analysis, that have become rare in current literature. In this survey, we systematically review current imitation learning literature and present our findings by (i) classifying imitation learning techniques, environments and metrics by introducing novel taxonomies; (ii) reflecting on main problems from the literature; and (iii) presenting challenges and future directions for researchers.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models (LLMs) as Agents for Augmented Democracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03452v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore an augmented democracy system built on off-the-shelf LLMs fine-tuned to augment data on citizen's preferences elicited over policies extracted from the government programs of the two main candidates of Brazil's 2022 presidential election. We use a train-test cross-validation setup to estimate the accuracy with which the LLMs predict both: a subject's individual political choices and the aggregate preferences of the full sample of participants. At the individual level, we find that LLMs predict out of sample preferences more accurately than a "bundle rule", which would assume that citizens always vote for the proposals of the candidate aligned with their self-reported political orientation. At the population level, we show that a probabilistic sample augmented by an LLM provides a more accurate estimate of the aggregate preferences of a population than the non-augmented probabilistic sample alone. Together, these results indicates that policy preference data augmented using LLMs can capture nuances that transcend party lines and represents a promising avenue of research for data augmentation.</description>

      <title>FloorSet -- a VLSI Floorplanning Dataset with Design Constraints of Real-World SoCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floorplanning for systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) and its sub-systems is a crucial and non-trivial step of the physical design flow. It represents a difficult combinatorial optimization problem. A typical large scale SoC with 120 partitions generates a search-space of nearly 10E250. As novel machine learning (ML) approaches emerge to tackle such problems, there is a growing need for a modern benchmark that comprises a large training dataset and performance metrics that better reflect real-world constraints and objectives compared to existing benchmarks. To address this need, we present FloorSet -- two comprehensive datasets of synthetic fixed-outline floorplan layouts that reflect the distribution of real SoCs. Each dataset has 1M training samples and 100 test samples where each sample is a synthetic floor-plan. FloorSet-Prime comprises fully-abutted rectilinear partitions and near-optimal wire-length. A simplified dataset that reflects early design phases, FloorSet-Lite comprises rectangular partitions, with under 5 percent white-space and near-optimal wire-length. Both datasets define hard constraints seen in modern design flows such as shape constraints, edge-affinity, grouping constraints, and pre-placement constraints. FloorSet is intended to spur fundamental research on large-scale constrained optimization problems. Crucially, FloorSet alleviates the core issue of reproducibility in modern ML driven solutions to such problems. FloorSet is available as an open-source repository for the research community.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the power of longitudinal medical imaging for eye disease prognosis using Transformer-based sequence modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has enabled breakthroughs in automated diagnosis from medical imaging, with many successful applications in ophthalmology. However, standard medical image classification approaches only assess disease presence at the time of acquisition, neglecting the common clinical setting of longitudinal imaging. For slow, progressive eye diseases like age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), patients undergo repeated imaging over time to track disease progression and forecasting the future risk of developing disease is critical to properly plan treatment. Our proposed Longitudinal Transformer for Survival Analysis (LTSA) enables dynamic disease prognosis from longitudinal medical imaging, modeling the time to disease from sequences of fundus photography images captured over long, irregular time periods. Using longitudinal imaging data from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS), LTSA significantly outperformed a single-image baseline in 19/20 head-to-head comparisons on late AMD prognosis and 18/20 comparisons on POAG prognosis. A temporal attention analysis also suggested that, while the most recent image is typically the most influential, prior imaging still provides additional prognostic value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods for time series have already reached excellent performances in both prediction and classification tasks, including anomaly detection. However, the complexity inherent in Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) creates a challenge when it comes to explainability methods. To overcome this inherent lack of interpretability, we propose ECATS, a concept-based neuro-symbolic architecture where concepts are represented as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. Leveraging kernel-based methods for STL, concept embeddings are learnt in an unsupervised manner through a cross-attention mechanism. The network makes class predictions through these concept embeddings, allowing for a meaningful explanation to be naturally extracted for each input. Our preliminary experiments with a simple CPS-based dataset show that our model is able to achieve great classification performance while ensuring local interpretability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00019v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce EHR-SeqSQL, a novel sequential text-to-SQL dataset for Electronic Health Record (EHR) databases. EHR-SeqSQL is designed to address critical yet underexplored aspects in text-to-SQL parsing: interactivity, compositionality, and efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, EHR-SeqSQL is not only the largest but also the first medical text-to-SQL dataset benchmark to include sequential and contextual questions. We provide a data split and the new test set designed to assess compositional generalization ability. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of a multi-turn approach over a single-turn approach in learning compositionality. Additionally, our dataset integrates specially crafted tokens into SQL queries to improve execution efficiency. With EHR-SeqSQL, we aim to bridge the gap between practical needs and academic research in the text-to-SQL domain. EHR-SeqSQL is available at https://github.com/seonhee99/EHR-SeqSQL.</description>

      <title>DualTime: A Dual-Adapter Multimodal Language Model for Time Series Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent rapid development of language models (LMs) has attracted attention in the field of time series, including multimodal time series modeling. However, we note that current time series multimodal methods are biased, often assigning a primary role to one modality while the other assumes a secondary role. They overlook the mutual benefits and complementary of different modalities. For example, in seizure diagnosis, relying solely on textual clinical reports makes it difficult to pinpoint the area and type of the disease, while electroencephalograms (EEGs) alone cannot provide an accurate diagnosis without considering the symptoms. In this study, based on the complementary information mining of time series multimodal data, we propose DualTime, a Dual-adapter multimodal language model for Time series representation implementing temporal-primary and textual-primary modeling simultaneously. By injecting lightweight adaption tokens, the LM pipeline shared by dual adapters encourages embedding alignment and achieves efficient fine-tuning. Empirically, our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both supervised and unsupervised settings, highlighting the complementary benefits of different modalities. In addition, we conduct few-shot label transfer experiments, which further verifies the transferability and expressiveness of our proposed DualTime.</description>

      <title>MMWorld: Towards Multi-discipline Multi-faceted World Model Evaluation in Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Language Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate the emerging abilities of "world models" -- interpreting and reasoning about complex real-world dynamics. To assess these abilities, we posit videos are the ideal medium, as they encapsulate rich representations of real-world dynamics and causalities. To this end, we introduce MMWorld, a new benchmark for multi-discipline, multi-faceted multimodal video understanding. MMWorld distinguishes itself from previous video understanding benchmarks with two unique advantages: (1) multi-discipline, covering various disciplines that often require domain expertise for comprehensive understanding; (2) multi-faceted reasoning, including explanation, counterfactual thinking, future prediction, etc. MMWorld consists of a human-annotated dataset to evaluate MLLMs with questions about the whole videos and a synthetic dataset to analyze MLLMs within a single modality of perception. Together, MMWorld encompasses 1,910 videos across seven broad disciplines and 69 subdisciplines, complete with 6,627 question-answer pairs and associated captions. The evaluation includes 2 proprietary and 10 open-source MLLMs, which struggle on MMWorld (e.g., GPT-4V performs the best with only 52.3\% accuracy), showing large room for improvement. Further ablation studies reveal other interesting findings such as models' different skill sets from humans. We hope MMWorld can serve as an essential step towards world model evaluation in videos.</description>

      <title>Evidential Uncertainty Sets in Deep Classifiers Using Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Evidential Conformal Prediction (ECP) method for image classifiers to generate the conformal prediction sets. Our method is designed based on a non-conformity score function that has its roots in Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) as a method of quantifying model (epistemic) uncertainty in DNN classifiers. We use evidence that are derived from the logit values of target labels to compute the components of our non-conformity score function: the heuristic notion of uncertainty in CP, uncertainty surprisal, and expected utility. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that ECP outperforms three state-of-the-art methods for generating CP sets, in terms of their set sizes and adaptivity while maintaining the coverage of true labels.</description>

      <title>MAMA-MIA: A Large-Scale Multi-Center Breast Cancer DCE-MRI Benchmark Dataset with Expert Segmentations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current research in breast cancer Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), especially with Artificial Intelligence (AI), faces challenges due to the lack of expert segmentations. To address this, we introduce the MAMA-MIA dataset, comprising 1506 multi-center dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI cases with expert segmentations of primary tumors and non-mass enhancement areas. These cases were sourced from four publicly available collections in The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Initially, we trained a deep learning model to automatically segment the cases, generating preliminary segmentations that significantly reduced expert segmentation time. Sixteen experts, averaging 9 years of experience in breast cancer, then corrected these segmentations, resulting in the final expert segmentations. Additionally, two radiologists conducted a visual inspection of the automatic segmentations to support future quality control studies. Alongside the expert segmentations, we provide 49 harmonized demographic and clinical variables and the pretrained weights of the well-known nnUNet architecture trained using the DCE-MRI full-images and expert segmentations. This dataset aims to accelerate the development and benchmarking of deep learning models and foster innovation in breast cancer diagnostics and treatment planning.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Assume People are More Rational than We Really are</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17055v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order for AI systems to communicate effectively with people, they must understand how we make decisions. However, people's decisions are not always rational, so the implicit internal models of human decision-making in Large Language Models (LLMs) must account for this. Previous empirical evidence seems to suggest that these implicit models are accurate -- LLMs offer believable proxies of human behavior, acting how we expect humans would in everyday interactions. However, by comparing LLM behavior and predictions to a large dataset of human decisions, we find that this is actually not the case: when both simulating and predicting people's choices, a suite of cutting-edge LLMs (GPT-4o &amp; 4-Turbo, Llama-3-8B &amp; 70B, Claude 3 Opus) assume that people are more rational than we really are. Specifically, these models deviate from human behavior and align more closely with a classic model of rational choice -- expected value theory. Interestingly, people also tend to assume that other people are rational when interpreting their behavior. As a consequence, when we compare the inferences that LLMs and people draw from the decisions of others using another psychological dataset, we find that these inferences are highly correlated. Thus, the implicit decision-making models of LLMs appear to be aligned with the human expectation that other people will act rationally, rather than with how people actually act.</description>

      <title>Harnessing LLMs for Automated Video Content Analysis: An Exploratory Workflow of Short Videos on Depression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the growing interest in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for content analysis, current studies have primarily focused on text-based content. In the present work, we explored the potential of LLMs in assisting video content analysis by conducting a case study that followed a new workflow of LLM-assisted multimodal content analysis. The workflow encompasses codebook design, prompt engineering, LLM processing, and human evaluation. We strategically crafted annotation prompts to get LLM Annotations in structured form and explanation prompts to generate LLM Explanations for a better understanding of LLM reasoning and transparency. To test LLM's video annotation capabilities, we analyzed 203 keyframes extracted from 25 YouTube short videos about depression. We compared the LLM Annotations with those of two human coders and found that LLM has higher accuracy in object and activity Annotations than emotion and genre Annotations. Moreover, we identified the potential and limitations of LLM's capabilities in annotating videos. Based on the findings, we explore opportunities and challenges for future research and improvements to the workflow. We also discuss ethical concerns surrounding future studies based on LLM-assisted video analysis.</description>

      <title>Improving Zero-shot Generalization of Learned Prompts via Unsupervised Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, but fall short of the performance of supervised methods in generalizing to downstream tasks with limited data. Prompt learning is emerging as a parameter-efficient method for adapting VLMs, but state-of-the-art approaches require annotated samples. In this paper we propose a novel approach to prompt learning based on unsupervised knowledge distillation from more powerful models. Our approach, which we call Knowledge Distillation Prompt Learning (KDPL), can be integrated into existing prompt learning techniques and eliminates the need for labeled examples during adaptation. Our experiments on more than ten standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that KDPL is very effective at improving generalization of learned prompts for zero-shot domain generalization, zero-shot cross-dataset generalization, and zero-shot base-to-novel class generalization problems. KDPL requires no ground-truth labels for adaptation, and moreover we show that even in the absence of any knowledge of training class names it can be used to effectively transfer knowledge. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/miccunifi/KDPL.</description>

      <title>Learning with Alignments: Tackling the Inter- and Intra-domain Shifts for Cross-multidomain Facial Expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) holds significant importance in human-computer interactions. Existing cross-domain FER methods often transfer knowledge solely from a single labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, neglecting the comprehensive information across multiple sources. Nevertheless, cross-multidomain FER (CMFER) is very challenging for (i) the inherent inter-domain shifts across multiple domains and (ii) the intra-domain shifts stemming from the ambiguous expressions and low inter-class distinctions. In this paper, we propose a novel Learning with Alignments CMFER framework, named LA-CMFER, to handle both inter- and intra-domain shifts. Specifically, LA-CMFER is constructed with a global branch and a local branch to extract features from the full images and local subtle expressions, respectively. Based on this, LA-CMFER presents a dual-level inter-domain alignment method to force the model to prioritize hard-to-align samples in knowledge transfer at a sample level while gradually generating a well-clustered feature space with the guidance of class attributes at a cluster level, thus narrowing the inter-domain shifts. To address the intra-domain shifts, LA-CMFER introduces a multi-view intra-domain alignment method with a multi-view clustering consistency constraint where a prediction similarity matrix is built to pursue consistency between the global and local views, thus refining pseudo labels and eliminating latent noise. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets have validated the superiority of our LA-CMFER.</description>

      <title>MagMax: Leveraging Model Merging for Seamless Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a continual learning approach named MagMax, which utilizes model merging to enable large pre-trained models to continuously learn from new data without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Distinct from traditional continual learning methods that aim to reduce forgetting during task training, MagMax combines sequential fine-tuning with a maximum magnitude weight selection for effective knowledge integration across tasks. Our initial contribution is an extensive examination of model merging techniques, revealing that simple approaches like weight averaging and random weight selection surprisingly hold up well in various continual learning contexts. More importantly, we present MagMax, a novel model-merging strategy that enables continual learning of large pre-trained models for successive tasks. Our thorough evaluation demonstrates the superiority of MagMax in various scenarios, including class- and domain-incremental learning settings.

      <description>arXiv:2407.09105v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Padding is often used in tuning LLM models by adding special tokens to shorter training examples to match the length of the longest sequence in each batch. While this ensures uniformity for batch processing, it introduces inefficiencies by including irrelevant padding tokens in the computation and wastes GPU resources. Hugging Face SFT trainer has always offered the option to use packing to combine multiple training examples, allowing for maximal utilization of GPU resources. However, up till now, it did not offer proper masking of each packed training example. This capability has now been added to Hugging Face Transformers 4.43. We analyse this new feature and show the benefits across different variations of packing.</description>

      <title>Key-Point-Driven Mathematical Reasoning Distillation of Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in mathematical reasoning tasks due to their extensive parameter counts and training on vast datasets. Despite these capabilities, deploying LLMs is hindered by their computational demands. Distilling LLM mathematical reasoning into Smaller Language Models (SLMs) has emerged as a solution to this challenge, although these smaller models often suffer from errors in calculation and semantic understanding. Prior work has proposed Program-of-Thought Distillation (PoTD) to avoid calculation error. To further address semantic understanding errors, we propose Key-Point-Driven Mathematical Reasoning Distillation (KPDD). KPDD enhances the reasoning performance of SLMs by breaking down the problem-solving process into three stages: Core Question Extraction, Problem-Solving Information Extraction, and Step-by-Step Solution. This method is further divided into KPDD-CoT, which generates Chain-of-Thought rationales, and KPDD-PoT, which creates Program-of-Thought rationales. The experiment results show that KPDD-CoT significantly improves reasoning abilities, while KPDD-PoT achieves state-of-the-art performance in mathematical reasoning tasks. Our approach effectively mitigates misunderstanding errors, advancing the deployment of efficient and capable SLMs.</description>

      <title>CourseAssist: Pedagogically Appropriate AI Tutor for Computer Science Education</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing enrollments in computer science courses and increase in class sizes necessitate scalable, automated tutoring solutions to adequately support student learning. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have demonstrated potential in assisting students through question-answering, educators express concerns over student overreliance, miscomprehension of generated code, and the risk of inaccurate answers. Rather than banning these tools outright, we advocate for a constructive approach that harnesses the capabilities of AI while mitigating potential risks. This poster introduces CourseAssist, a novel LLM-based tutoring system tailored for computer science education. Unlike generic LLM systems, CourseAssist uses retrieval-augmented generation, user intent classification, and question decomposition to align AI responses with specific course materials and learning objectives, thereby ensuring pedagogical appropriateness of LLMs in educational settings. We evaluated CourseAssist against a baseline of GPT-4 using a dataset of 50 question-answer pairs from a programming languages course, focusing on the criteria of usefulness, accuracy, and pedagogical appropriateness. Evaluation results show that CourseAssist significantly outperforms the baseline, demonstrating its potential to serve as an effective learning assistant. We have also deployed CourseAssist in 6 computer science courses at a large public R1 research university reaching over 500 students. Interviews with 20 student users show that CourseAssist improves computer science instruction by increasing the accessibility of course-specific tutoring help and shortening the feedback loop on their programming assignments. Future work will include extensive pilot testing at more universities and exploring better collaborative relationships between students, educators, and AI that improve computer science learning experiences.</description>

      <title>ISMRNN: An Implicitly Segmented RNN Method with Mamba for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10768v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long time series forecasting aims to utilize historical information to forecast future states over extended horizons. Traditional RNN-based series forecasting methods struggle to effectively address long-term dependencies and gradient issues in long time series problems. Recently, SegRNN has emerged as a leading RNN-based model tailored for long-term series forecasting, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a streamlined architecture through innovative segmentation and parallel decoding techniques. Nevertheless, SegRNN has several limitations: its fixed segmentation disrupts data continuity and fails to effectively leverage information across different segments, the segmentation strategy employed by SegRNN does not fundamentally address the issue of information loss within the recurrent structure. To address these issues, we propose the ISMRNN method with three key enhancements: we introduce an implicit segmentation structure to decompose the time series and map it to segmented hidden states, resulting in denser information exchange during the segmentation phase. Additionally, we incorporate residual structures in the encoding layer to mitigate information loss within the recurrent structure. To extract information more effectively, we further integrate the Mamba architecture to enhance time series information extraction. Experiments on several real-world long time series forecasting datasets demonstrate that our model surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computer vision systems have been deployed in various applications involving biometrics like human faces. These systems can identify social media users, search for missing persons, and verify identity of individuals. While computer vision models are often evaluated for accuracy on available benchmarks, more annotated data is necessary to learn about their robustness and fairness against semantic distributional shifts in input data, especially in face data. Among annotated data, counterfactual examples grant strong explainability characteristics. Because collecting natural face data is prohibitively expensive, we put forth a generative AI-based framework to construct targeted, counterfactual, high-quality synthetic face data. Our synthetic data pipeline has many use cases, including face recognition systems sensitivity evaluations and image understanding system probes. The pipeline is validated with multiple user studies. We showcase the efficacy of our face generation pipeline on a leading commercial vision model. We identify facial attributes that cause vision systems to fail.</description>

      <title>HyperbolicLR: Epoch insensitive learning rate scheduler</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes two novel learning rate schedulers: the Hyperbolic Learning Rate Scheduler (HyperbolicLR) and the Exponential Hyperbolic Learning Rate Scheduler (ExpHyperbolicLR). These schedulers attempt to address the inconsistent learning curves often observed in conventional schedulers when adjusting the number of epochs. By leveraging the asymptotic behavior of hyperbolic curves, the proposed schedulers maintain more consistent learning curves across varying epoch settings. The HyperbolicLR algorithm directly applies this property to the epoch-learning rate space, while the ExpHyperbolicLR maps this concept onto the exponential space of epochs and learning rates. To evaluate the performance of these schedulers, first we found the optimal hyperparameters for each scheduler on a small number of epochs, fixed these values, and compared their performance as the number of epochs increased. Our experimental results on various deep learning tasks and architectures demonstrate that both HyperbolicLR and ExpHyperbolicLR maintain more consistent performance improvements compared to conventional schedulers as the number of epochs increases. These findings suggest that our hyperbolic-based learning rate schedulers offer a more robust and efficient approach to training deep neural networks, especially in scenarios where computational resources or time constraints limit extensive hyperparameter searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence has transformed the generation of synthetic data, providing innovative solutions to challenges like data scarcity and privacy, which are particularly critical in fields such as medicine. However, the effective use of this synthetic data to train high-performance models remains a significant challenge. This paper addresses this issue by introducing Knowledge Recycling (KR), a pipeline designed to optimise the generation and use of synthetic data for training downstream classifiers. At the heart of this pipeline is Generative Knowledge Distillation (GKD), the proposed technique that significantly improves the quality and usefulness of the information provided to classifiers through a synthetic dataset regeneration and soft labelling mechanism. The KR pipeline has been tested on a variety of datasets, with a focus on six highly heterogeneous medical image datasets, ranging from retinal images to organ scans. The results show a significant reduction in the performance gap between models trained on real and synthetic data, with models based on synthetic data outperforming those trained on real data in some cases. Furthermore, the resulting models show almost complete immunity to Membership Inference Attacks, manifesting privacy properties missing in models trained with conventional techniques.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This document presents the Center for Robot Assisted Search And Rescue - Uncrewed Aerial Systems - Disaster Response Overhead Inspection Dataset (CRASAR-U-DROIDs) for building damage assessment and spatial alignment collected from small uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) geospatial imagery. This dataset is motivated by the increasing use of sUAS in disaster response and the lack of previous work in utilizing high-resolution geospatial sUAS imagery for machine learning and computer vision models, the lack of alignment with operational use cases, and with hopes of enabling further investigations between sUAS and satellite imagery. The CRASAR-U-DRIODs dataset consists of fifty-two (52) orthomosaics from ten (10) federally declared disasters (Hurricane Ian, Hurricane Ida, Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Idalia, Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Michael, Musset Bayou Fire, Mayfield Tornado, Kilauea Eruption, and Champlain Towers Collapse) spanning 67.98 square kilometers (26.245 square miles), containing 21,716 building polygons and damage labels, and 7,880 adjustment annotations. The imagery was tiled and presented in conjunction with overlaid building polygons to a pool of 130 annotators who provided human judgments of damage according to the Joint Damage Scale. These annotations were then reviewed via a two-stage review process in which building polygon damage labels were first reviewed individually and then again by committee. Additionally, the building polygons have been aligned spatially to precisely overlap with the imagery to enable more performant machine learning models to be trained. It appears that CRASAR-U-DRIODs is the largest labeled dataset of sUAS orthomosaic imagery.</description>

      <title>A Role-specific Guided Large Language Model for Ophthalmic Consultation Based on Stylistic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ophthalmology consultations are crucial for diagnosing, treating, and preventing eye diseases. However, the growing demand for consultations exceeds the availability of ophthalmologists. By leveraging large pre-trained language models, we can design effective dialogues for specific scenarios, aiding in consultations. Traditional fine-tuning strategies for question-answering tasks are impractical due to increasing model size and often ignoring patient-doctor role function during consultations. In this paper, we propose EyeDoctor, an ophthalmic medical questioning large language model that enhances accuracy through doctor-patient role perception guided and an augmented knowledge base with external disease information. Experimental results show EyeDoctor achieves higher question-answering precision in ophthalmology consultations. Notably, EyeDoctor demonstrated a 7.25% improvement in Rouge-1 scores and a 10.16% improvement in F1 scores on multi-round datasets compared to second best model ChatGPT, highlighting the importance of doctor-patient role differentiation and dynamic knowledge base expansion for intelligent medical consultations. EyeDoc also serves as a free available web based service and souce code is available at https://github.com/sperfu/EyeDoc.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Graph Structure as Prompt: Improving Small Language Models Capabilities for Knowledge-based Causal Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal discovery aims to estimate causal structures among variables based on observational data. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a fresh perspective to tackle the causal discovery problem by reasoning on the metadata associated with variables rather than their actual data values, an approach referred to as knowledge-based causal discovery. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of Small Language Models (SLMs, defined as LLMs with fewer than 1 billion parameters) with prompt-based learning for knowledge-based causal discovery. Specifically, we present KG Structure as Prompt, a novel approach for integrating structural information from a knowledge graph, such as common neighbor nodes and metapaths, into prompt-based learning to enhance the capabilities of SLMs. Experimental results on three types of biomedical and open-domain datasets under few-shot settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, surpassing most baselines and even conventional fine-tuning approaches trained on full datasets. Our findings further highlight the strong capabilities of SLMs: in combination with knowledge graphs and prompt-based learning, SLMs demonstrate the potential to surpass LLMs with larger number of parameters. Our code and datasets are available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Engaging with Children's Artwork in Mixed Visual-Ability Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two studies exploring how blind or low-vision (BLV) family members engage with their sighted children's artwork, strategies to support understanding and interpretation, and the potential role of technology, such as AI, therein. Our first study involved 14 BLV individuals, and the second included five groups of BLV individuals with their children. Through semi-structured interviews with AI descriptions of children's artwork and multi-sensory design probes, we found that BLV family members value artwork engagement as a bonding opportunity, preferring the child's storytelling and interpretation over other nonvisual representations. Additionally, despite some inaccuracies, BLV family members felt that AI-generated descriptions could facilitate dialogue with their children and aid self-guided art discovery. We close with specific design considerations for supporting artwork engagement in mixed visual-ability families, including enabling artwork access through various methods, supporting children's corrections of AI output, and distinctions in context vs. content and interpretation vs. description of children's artwork.</description>

      <title>When AI Meets Finance (StockAgent): Large Language Model-based Stock Trading in Simulated Real-world Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can AI Agents simulate real-world trading environments to investigate the impact of external factors on stock trading activities (e.g., macroeconomics, policy changes, company fundamentals, and global events)? These factors, which frequently influence trading behaviors, are critical elements in the quest for maximizing investors' profits. Our work attempts to solve this problem through large language model based agents. We have developed a multi-agent AI system called StockAgent, driven by LLMs, designed to simulate investors' trading behaviors in response to the real stock market. The StockAgent allows users to evaluate the impact of different external factors on investor trading and to analyze trading behavior and profitability effects. Additionally, StockAgent avoids the test set leakage issue present in existing trading simulation systems based on AI Agents. Specifically, it prevents the model from leveraging prior knowledge it may have acquired related to the test data. We evaluate different LLMs under the framework of StockAgent in a stock trading environment that closely resembles real-world conditions. The experimental results demonstrate the impact of key external factors on stock market trading, including trading behavior and stock price fluctuation rules. This research explores the study of agents' free trading gaps in the context of no prior knowledge related to market data. The patterns identified through StockAgent simulations provide valuable insights for LLM-based investment advice and stock recommendation. The code is available at https://github.com/MingyuJ666/Stockagent.</description>

      <title>Meta-Rewarding Language Models: Self-Improving Alignment with LLM-as-a-Meta-Judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly surpassing human knowledge in many domains. While improving these models traditionally relies on costly human data, recent self-rewarding mechanisms (Yuan et al., 2024) have shown that LLMs can improve by judging their own responses instead of relying on human labelers. However, existing methods have primarily focused on improving model responses rather than judgment capabilities, resulting in rapid saturation during iterative training. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Meta-Rewarding step to the self-improvement process, where the model judges its own judgements and uses that feedback to refine its judgment skills. Surprisingly, this unsupervised approach improves the model's ability to judge {\em and} follow instructions, as demonstrated by a win rate improvement of Llama-3-8B-Instruct from 22.9% to 39.4% on AlpacaEval 2, and 20.6% to 29.1% on Arena-Hard. These results strongly suggest the potential for self-improving models without human supervision.</description>

      <title>CollectiveSFT: Scaling Large Language Models for Chinese Medical Benchmark with Collective Instructions in Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has prompted the creation of numerous benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities.This study focuses on the Comprehensive Medical Benchmark in Chinese (CMB), showcasing how dataset diversity and distribution in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may enhance LLM performance.Remarkably, We successfully trained a smaller base model to achieve scores comparable to larger models, indicating that a diverse and well-distributed dataset can optimize performance regardless of model size.This study suggests that even smaller models may reach high performance levels with carefully curated and varied datasets. By integrating a wide range of instructional content, our approach addresses potential issues such as data quality inconsistencies. Our results imply that a broader spectrum of training data may enhance a model's ability to generalize and perform effectively across different medical scenarios, highlighting the importance of dataset quality and diversity in fine-tuning processes. We open-source the model for future research at https://github.com/CAS-SIAT-XinHai/CollectiveSFT</description>

      <title>Mixture of Nested Experts: Adaptive Processing of Visual Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The visual medium (images and videos) naturally contains a large amount of information redundancy, thereby providing a great opportunity for leveraging efficiency in processing. While Vision Transformer (ViT) based models scale effectively to large data regimes, they fail to capitalize on this inherent redundancy, leading to higher computational costs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) networks demonstrate scalability while maintaining same inference-time costs, but they come with a larger parameter footprint. We present Mixture of Nested Experts (MoNE), which utilizes a nested structure for experts, wherein individual experts fall on an increasing compute-accuracy curve. Given a compute budget, MoNE learns to dynamically choose tokens in a priority order, and thus redundant tokens are processed through cheaper nested experts. Using this framework, we achieve equivalent performance as the baseline models, while reducing inference time compute by over two-fold. We validate our approach on standard image and video datasets - ImageNet-21K, Kinetics400, and Something-Something-v2. We further highlight MoNE$'$s adaptability by showcasing its ability to maintain strong performance across different inference-time compute budgets on videos, using only a single trained model.</description>

      <title>MimiQ: Low-Bit Data-Free Quantization of Vision Transformers with Encouraging Inter-Head Attention Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-free quantization (DFQ) is a technique that creates a lightweight network from its full-precision counterpart without the original training data, often through a synthetic dataset. Although several DFQ methods have been proposed for vision transformer (ViT) architectures, they fail to achieve efficacy in low-bit settings. Examining the existing methods, we identify that their synthetic data produce misaligned attention maps, while those of the real samples are highly aligned. From the observation of aligned attention, we find that aligning attention maps of synthetic data helps to improve the overall performance of quantized ViTs. Motivated by this finding, we devise \aname, a novel DFQ method designed for ViTs that focuses on inter-head attention similarity. First, we generate synthetic data by aligning head-wise attention responses in relation to spatial query patches. Then, we apply head-wise structural attention distillation to align the attention maps of the quantized network to those of the full-precision teacher. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art performance for data-free ViT quantization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an innovative federated learning (FL) approach that utilizes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for classification tasks. By utilizing the adaptive activation capabilities of KANs in a federated framework, we aim to improve classification capabilities while preserving privacy. The study evaluates the performance of federated KANs (F- KANs) compared to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) on classification task. The results show that the F-KANs model significantly outperforms the federated MLP model in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and stability, and achieves better performance, paving the way for more efficient and privacy-preserving predictive analytics.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Self-supervised Robust Clustering for Unstructured Data with Unknown Cluster Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel self-supervised deep clustering approach tailored for unstructured data without requiring prior knowledge of the number of clusters, termed Adaptive Self-supervised Robust Clustering (ASRC). In particular, ASRC adaptively learns the graph structure and edge weights to capture both local and global structural information. The obtained graph enables us to learn clustering-friendly feature representations by an enhanced graph auto-encoder with contrastive learning technique. It further leverages the clustering results adaptively obtained by robust continuous clustering (RCC) to generate prototypes for negative sampling, which can further contribute to promoting consistency among positive pairs and enlarging the gap between positive and negative samples. ASRC obtains the final clustering results by applying RCC to the learned feature representations with their consistent graph structure and edge weights. Extensive experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of ASRC, demonstrating its superior performance over other popular clustering models. Notably, ASRC even outperforms methods that rely on prior knowledge of the number of clusters, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of clustering unstructured data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of multimedia and computer vision technologies requires adaptive visual model deployment strategies to effectively handle diverse tasks and varying environments. This work introduces AxiomVision, a novel framework that can guarantee accuracy by leveraging edge computing to dynamically select the most efficient visual models for video analytics under diverse scenarios. Utilizing a tiered edge-cloud architecture, AxiomVision enables the deployment of a broad spectrum of visual models, from lightweight to complex DNNs, that can be tailored to specific scenarios while considering camera source impacts. In addition, AxiomVision provides three core innovations: (1) a dynamic visual model selection mechanism utilizing continual online learning, (2) an efficient online method that efficiently takes into account the influence of the camera's perspective, and (3) a topology-driven grouping approach that accelerates the model selection process. With rigorous theoretical guarantees, these advancements provide a scalable and effective solution for visual tasks inherent to multimedia systems, such as object detection, classification, and counting. Empirically, AxiomVision achieves a 25.7\% improvement in accuracy.</description>
