      <title>The collective use and evaluation of generative AI tools in digital humanities research: Survey-based results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies has revolutionized research, with significant implications for Digital Humanities (DH), a field inherently intertwined with technological progress. This article investigates how digital humanities scholars adopt, practice, as well as critically evaluate, GenAI technologies such as ChatGPT in the research process. Drawing on 76 responses collected from an international survey study, we explored digital humanities scholars' rationale for GenAI adoption in research, identified specific use cases and practices of using GenAI to support various DH research tasks, and analyzed scholars' collective perceptions of GenAI's benefits, risks, and impact on DH research. The survey results suggest that DH research communities hold divisive sentiments towards the value of GenAI in DH scholarship, whereas the actual usage diversifies among individuals and across research tasks. Our survey-based analysis has the potential to serve as a basis for further empirical research on the impact of GenAI on the evolution of DH scholarship.</description>

      <title>NLP-enabled trajectory map-matching in urban road networks using transformer sequence-to-sequence model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale geolocation telematics data acquired from connected vehicles has the potential to significantly enhance mobility infrastructures and operational systems within smart cities. To effectively utilize this data, it is essential to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally, statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale datasets and makes them more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a sequence-to-sequence deep-learning model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as a surrogate for map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a representation that automatically captures autoregressive behavior and spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates data points with the road network features and thus transforms these representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an accuracy of 76%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed in natural language processing presented a promising performance for translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.</description>

      <title>Centralized vs. Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Control of Electric Vehicle Charging Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) poses several challenges to power distribution networks and smart grid infrastructure due to the possibility of significantly increasing electricity demands, especially during peak hours. Furthermore, when EVs participate in demand-side management programs, charging expenses can be reduced by using optimal charging control policies that fully utilize real-time pricing schemes. However, devising optimal charging methods and control strategies for EVs is challenging due to various stochastic and uncertain environmental factors. Currently, most EV charging controllers operate based on a centralized model. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for distributed and cooperative charging strategy using a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework. Our method is built upon the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm for a group of EVs in a residential community, where all EVs are connected to a shared transformer. This method, referred to as CTDE-DDPG, adopts a Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) approach to establish cooperation between agents during the training phase, while ensuring a distributed and privacy-preserving operation during execution. We theoretically examine the performance of centralized and decentralized critics for the DDPG-based MARL implementation and demonstrate their trade-offs. Furthermore, we numerically explore the efficiency, scalability, and performance of centralized and decentralized critics. Our theoretical and numerical results indicate that, despite higher policy gradient variances and training complexity, the CTDE-DDPG framework significantly improves charging efficiency by reducing total variation by approximately %36 and charging cost by around %9.1 on average...</description>

      <title>Towards Large Language Models as Copilots for Theorem Proving in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theorem proving is an important challenge for large language models (LLMs), as formal proofs can be checked rigorously by proof assistants such as Lean, leaving no room for hallucination. Existing LLM-based provers try to prove theorems in a fully autonomous mode without human intervention. In this mode, they struggle with novel and challenging theorems, for which human insights may be critical. In this paper, we explore LLMs as copilots that assist humans in proving theorems. We introduce Lean Copilot, a framework for running LLM inference in Lean. It enables programmers to build various LLM-based proof automation tools that integrate seamlessly into the workflow of Lean users. Using Lean Copilot, we build tools for suggesting proof steps (tactic suggestion), completing intermediate proof goals (proof search), and selecting relevant premises (premise selection) using LLMs. Users can use our pretrained models or bring their own ones that run either locally (with or without GPUs) or on the cloud. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in assisting humans and automating theorem proving process compared to existing rule-based proof automation in Lean. We open source all codes under a permissive MIT license to facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>RetailOpt: An Opt-In, Easy-to-Deploy Trajectory Estimation System Leveraging Smartphone Motion Data and Retail Facility Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present RetailOpt, a novel opt-in, easy-to-deploy system for tracking customer movements in indoor retail environments. The system utilizes information presently accessible to customers through smartphones and retail apps: motion data, store map, and purchase records. The approach eliminates the need for additional hardware installations/maintenance and ensures customers maintain full control of their data. Specifically, RetailOpt first employs inertial navigation to recover relative trajectories from smartphone motion data. The store map and purchase records are then cross-referenced to identify a list of visited shelves, providing anchors to localize the relative trajectories in a store through continuous and discrete optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through systematic experiments in five diverse environments. The proposed system, if successful, would produce accurate customer movement data, essential for a broad range of retail applications, including customer behavior analysis and in-store navigation. The potential application could also extend to other domains such as entertainment and assistive technologies.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Approach for Integrating Compressed Contexts into Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread use of knowledge graphs in various fields has brought about a challenge in effectively integrating and updating information within them. When it comes to incorporating contexts, conventional methods often rely on rules or basic machine learning models, which may not fully grasp the complexity and fluidity of context information. This research suggests an approach based on reinforcement learning (RL), specifically utilizing Deep Q Networks (DQN) to enhance the process of integrating contexts into knowledge graphs. By considering the state of the knowledge graph as environment states defining actions as operations for integrating contexts and using a reward function to gauge the improvement in knowledge graph quality post-integration, this method aims to automatically develop strategies for optimal context integration. Our DQN model utilizes networks as function approximators, continually updating Q values to estimate the action value function, thus enabling effective integration of intricate and dynamic context information. Initial experimental findings show that our RL method outperforms techniques in achieving precise context integration across various standard knowledge graph datasets, highlighting the potential and effectiveness of reinforcement learning in enhancing and managing knowledge graphs.</description>

      <title>GluMarker: A Novel Predictive Modeling of Glycemic Control Through Digital Biomarkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating prevalence of diabetes globally underscores the need for diabetes management. Recent research highlights the growing focus on digital biomarkers in diabetes management, with innovations in computational frameworks and noninvasive monitoring techniques using personalized glucose metrics. However, they predominantly focus on insulin dosing and specific glucose values, or with limited attention given to overall glycemic control. This leaves a gap in expanding the scope of digital biomarkers for overall glycemic control in diabetes management. To address such a research gap, we propose GluMarker -- an end-to-end framework for modeling digital biomarkers using broader factors sources to predict glycemic control. Through the assessment and refinement of various machine learning baselines, GluMarker achieves state-of-the-art on Anderson's dataset in predicting next-day glycemic control. Moreover, our research identifies key digital biomarkers for the next day's glycemic control prediction. These identified biomarkers are instrumental in illuminating the daily factors that influence glycemic management, offering vital insights for diabetes care.</description>

      <title>Grasper: A Generalist Pursuer for Pursuit-Evasion Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pursuit-evasion games (PEGs) model interactions between a team of pursuers and an evader in graph-based environments such as urban street networks. Recent advancements have demonstrated the effectiveness of the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm in PSRO to improve scalability in solving large-scale PEGs. However, these methods primarily focus on specific PEGs with fixed initial conditions that may vary substantially in real-world scenarios, which significantly hinders the applicability of the traditional methods. To address this issue, we introduce Grasper, a GeneRAlist purSuer for Pursuit-Evasion pRoblems, capable of efficiently generating pursuer policies tailored to specific PEGs. Our contributions are threefold: First, we present a novel architecture that offers high-quality solutions for diverse PEGs, comprising critical components such as (i) a graph neural network (GNN) to encode PEGs into hidden vectors, and (ii) a hypernetwork to generate pursuer policies based on these hidden vectors. As a second contribution, we develop an efficient three-stage training method involving (i) a pre-pretraining stage for learning robust PEG representations through self-supervised graph learning techniques like GraphMAE, (ii) a pre-training stage utilizing heuristic-guided multi-task pre-training (HMP) where heuristic-derived reference policies (e.g., through Dijkstra's algorithm) regularize pursuer policies, and (iii) a fine-tuning stage that employs PSRO to generate pursuer policies on designated PEGs. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world maps, showcasing Grasper's significant superiority over baselines in terms of solution quality and generalizability. We demonstrate that Grasper provides a versatile approach for solving pursuit-evasion problems across a broad range of scenarios, enabling practical deployment in real-world situations.</description>

      <title>FlagVNE: A Flexible and Generalizable Reinforcement Learning Framework for Network Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual network embedding (VNE) is an essential resource allocation task in network virtualization, aiming to map virtual network requests (VNRs) onto physical infrastructure. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising solution to this problem. However, existing RL-based VNE methods are limited by the unidirectional action design and one-size-fits-all training strategy, resulting in restricted searchability and generalizability. In this paper, we propose a FLexible And Generalizable RL framework for VNE, named FlagVNE. Specifically, we design a bidirectional action-based Markov decision process model that enables the joint selection of virtual and physical nodes, thus improving the exploration flexibility of solution space. To tackle the expansive and dynamic action space, we design a hierarchical decoder to generate adaptive action probability distributions and ensure high training efficiency. Furthermore, to overcome the generalization issue for varying VNR sizes, we propose a meta-RL-based training method with a curriculum scheduling strategy, facilitating specialized policy training for each VNR size. Finally, extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of FlagVNE across multiple key metrics. Our code is available at GitHub (https://github.com/GeminiLight/flag-vne).</description>

      <title>Learning to Cut via Hierarchical Sequence/Set Model for Efficient Mixed-Integer Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cutting planes (cuts) play an important role in solving mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs), which formulate many important real-world applications. Cut selection heavily depends on (P1) which cuts to prefer and (P2) how many cuts to select. Although modern MILP solvers tackle (P1)-(P2) by human-designed heuristics, machine learning carries the potential to learn more effective heuristics. However, many existing learning-based methods learn which cuts to prefer, neglecting the importance of learning how many cuts to select. Moreover, we observe that (P3) what order of selected cuts to prefer significantly impacts the efficiency of MILP solvers as well. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hierarchical sequence/set model (HEM) to learn cut selection policies. Specifically, HEM is a bi-level model: (1) a higher-level module that learns how many cuts to select, (2) and a lower-level module -- that formulates the cut selection as a sequence/set to sequence learning problem -- to learn policies selecting an ordered subset with the cardinality determined by the higher-level module. To the best of our knowledge, HEM is the first data-driven methodology that well tackles (P1)-(P3) simultaneously. Experiments demonstrate that HEM significantly improves the efficiency of solving MILPs on eleven challenging MILP benchmarks, including two Huawei's real problems.</description>

      <title>How Real Is Real? A Human Evaluation Framework for Unrestricted Adversarial Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With an ever-increasing reliance on machine learning (ML) models in the real world, adversarial examples threaten the safety of AI-based systems such as autonomous vehicles. In the image domain, they represent maliciously perturbed data points that look benign to humans (i.e., the image modification is not noticeable) but greatly mislead state-of-the-art ML models. Previously, researchers ensured the imperceptibility of their altered data points by restricting perturbations via $\ell_p$ norms. However, recent publications claim that creating natural-looking adversarial examples without such restrictions is also possible. With much more freedom to instill malicious information into data, these unrestricted adversarial examples can potentially overcome traditional defense strategies as they are not constrained by the limitations or patterns these defenses typically recognize and mitigate. This allows attackers to operate outside of expected threat models. However, surveying existing image-based methods, we noticed a need for more human evaluations of the proposed image modifications. Based on existing human-assessment frameworks for image generation quality, we propose SCOOTER - an evaluation framework for unrestricted image-based attacks. It provides researchers with guidelines for conducting statistically significant human experiments, standardized questions, and a ready-to-use implementation. We propose a framework that allows researchers to analyze how imperceptible their unrestricted attacks truly are.</description>

      <title>Data Authenticity, Consent, &amp; Provenance for AI are all broken: what will it take to fix them?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New capabilities in foundation models are owed in large part to massive, widely-sourced, and under-documented training data collections. Existing practices in data collection have led to challenges in documenting data transparency, tracing authenticity, verifying consent, privacy, representation, bias, copyright infringement, and the overall development of ethical and trustworthy foundation models. In response, regulation is emphasizing the need for training data transparency to understand foundation models' limitations. Based on a large-scale analysis of the foundation model training data landscape and existing solutions, we identify the missing infrastructure to facilitate responsible foundation model development practices. We examine the current shortcomings of common tools for tracing data authenticity, consent, and documentation, and outline how policymakers, developers, and data creators can facilitate responsible foundation model development by adopting universal data provenance standards.</description>

      <title>A Clean-graph Backdoor Attack against Graph Convolutional Networks with Poisoned Label Only</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown excellent performance in dealing with various graph structures such as node classification, graph classification and other tasks. However,recent studies have shown that GCNs are vulnerable to a novel threat known as backdoor attacks. However, all existing backdoor attacks in the graph domain require modifying the training samples to accomplish the backdoor injection, which may not be practical in many realistic scenarios where adversaries have no access to modify the training samples and may leads to the backdoor attack being detected easily. In order to explore the backdoor vulnerability of GCNs and create a more practical and stealthy backdoor attack method, this paper proposes a clean-graph backdoor attack against GCNs (CBAG) in the node classification task,which only poisons the training labels without any modification to the training samples, revealing that GCNs have this security vulnerability. Specifically, CBAG designs a new trigger exploration method to find important feature dimensions as the trigger patterns to improve the attack performance. By poisoning the training labels, a hidden backdoor is injected into the GCNs model. Experimental results show that our clean graph backdoor can achieve 99% attack success rate while maintaining the functionality of the GCNs model on benign samples.</description>

      <title>Food Development through Co-creation with AI: bread with a "taste of love"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores a new method in food development by utilizing AI including generative AI, aiming to craft products that delight the senses and resonate with consumers' emotions. The food ingredient recommendation approach used in this study can be considered as a form of multimodal generation in a broad sense, as it takes text as input and outputs food ingredient candidates. This Study focused on producing "Romance Bread," a collection of breads infused with flavors that reflect the nuances of a romantic Japanese television program. We analyzed conversations from TV programs and lyrics from songs featuring fruits and sweets to recommend ingredients that express romantic feelings. Based on these recommendations, the bread developers then considered the flavoring of the bread and developed new bread varieties. The research included a tasting evaluation involving 31 participants and interviews with the product developers. Findings indicate a notable correlation between tastes generated by AI and human preferences. This study validates the concept of using AI in food innovation and highlights the broad potential for developing unique consumer experiences that focus on emotional engagement through AI and human collaboration.</description>

      <title>How should AI decisions be explained? Requirements for Explanations from the Perspective of European Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between law and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). While there is much discussion about the AI Act, for which the trilogue of the European Parliament, Council and Commission recently concluded, other areas of law seem underexplored. This paper focuses on European (and in part German) law, although with international concepts and regulations such as fiduciary plausibility checks, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and product safety and liability. Based on XAI-taxonomies, requirements for XAI-methods are derived from each of the legal bases, resulting in the conclusion that each legal basis requires different XAI properties and that the current state of the art does not fulfill these to full satisfaction, especially regarding the correctness (sometimes called fidelity) and confidence estimates of XAI-methods.</description>

      <title>MM-PhyRLHF: Reinforcement Learning Framework for Multimodal Physics Question-Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs have shown their significant potential in tasks like text summarization and generation. Yet, they often encounter difficulty while solving complex physics problems that require arithmetic calculation and a good understanding of concepts. Moreover, many physics problems include images that contain important details required to understand the problem's context. We propose an LMM-based chatbot to answer multimodal physics MCQs. For domain adaptation, we utilize the MM-PhyQA dataset comprising Indian high school-level multimodal physics problems. To improve the LMM's performance, we experiment with two techniques, RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) and Image Captioning. In image captioning, we add a detailed explanation of the diagram in each image, minimizing hallucinations and image processing errors. We further explore the integration of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methodology inspired by the ranking approach in RLHF to enhance the human-like problem-solving abilities of the models. The RLHF approach incorporates human feedback into the learning process of LLMs, improving the model's problem-solving skills, truthfulness, and reasoning capabilities, minimizing the hallucinations in the answers, and improving the quality instead of using vanilla-supervised fine-tuned models. We employ the LLaVA open-source model to answer multimodal physics MCQs and compare the performance with and without using RLHF.</description>

      <title>Mapping Social Choice Theory to RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work on the limitations of using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to incorporate human preferences into model behavior often raises social choice theory as a reference point. Social choice theory's analysis of settings such as voting mechanisms provides technical infrastructure that can inform how to aggregate human preferences amid disagreement. We analyze the problem settings of social choice and RLHF, identify key differences between them, and discuss how these differences may affect the RLHF interpretation of well-known technical results in social choice.</description>

      <title>One-Step Detection Paradigm for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection via Spectral Deviation Relationship Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) involves identifying the targets that deviate spectrally from their surroundings, without prior knowledge. Recently, deep learning based methods have become the mainstream HAD methods, due to their powerful spatial-spectral feature extraction ability. However, the current deep detection models are optimized to complete a proxy task (two-step paradigm), such as background reconstruction or generation, rather than achieving anomaly detection directly. This leads to suboptimal results and poor transferability, which means that the deep model is trained and tested on the same image. In this paper, an unsupervised transferred direct detection (TDD) model is proposed, which is optimized directly for the anomaly detection task (one-step paradigm) and has transferability. Specially, the TDD model is optimized to identify the spectral deviation relationship according to the anomaly definition. Compared to learning the specific background distribution as most models do, the spectral deviation relationship is universal for different images and guarantees the model transferability. To train the TDD model in an unsupervised manner, an anomaly sample simulation strategy is proposed to generate numerous pairs of anomaly samples. Furthermore, a global self-attention module and a local self-attention module are designed to help the model focus on the "spectrally deviating" relationship. The TDD model was validated on four public HAD datasets. The results show that the proposed TDD model can successfully overcome the limitation of traditional model training and testing on a single image, and the model has a powerful detection ability and excellent transferability.</description>

Abstract: We present a modification of the Rose-Machta algorithm (Phys. Rev. E 100 (2019) 063304) and estimate the density of states for a two-dimensional Blume-Capel model, simulating $10^5$ replicas in parallel for each set of parameters. We perform a finite-size analysis of the specific heat and Binder cumulant, determine the critical temperature along the critical line, and evaluate the critical exponents. The results obtained are in good agreement with those obtained previously using various methods -- Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation, Wang-Landau simulation, transfer matrix, and series expansion. The simulation results clearly illustrate the typical behavior of specific heat along the critical lines and through the tricritical point.</description>

      <title>Model Failure or Data Corruption? Exploring Inconsistencies in Building Energy Ratings with Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building Energy Rating (BER) stands as a pivotal metric, enabling building owners, policymakers, and urban planners to understand the energy-saving potential through improving building energy efficiency. As such, enhancing buildings' BER levels is expected to directly contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions and promote climate improvement. Nonetheless, the BER assessment process is vulnerable to missing and inaccurate measurements. In this study, we introduce \texttt{CLEAR}, a data-driven approach designed to scrutinize the inconsistencies in BER assessments through self-supervised contrastive learning. We validated the effectiveness of \texttt{CLEAR} using a dataset representing Irish building stocks. Our experiments uncovered evidence of inconsistent BER assessments, highlighting measurement data corruption within this real-world dataset.</description>

      <title>Items or Relations -- what do Artificial Neural Networks learn?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What has an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) learned after being successfully trained to solve a task - the set of training items or the relations between them? This question is difficult to answer for modern applied ANNs because of their enormous size and complexity. Therefore, here we consider a low-dimensional network and a simple task, i.e., the network has to reproduce a set of training items identically. We construct the family of solutions analytically and use standard learning algorithms to obtain numerical solutions. These numerical solutions differ depending on the optimization algorithm and the weight initialization and are shown to be particular members of the family of analytical solutions. In this simple setting, we observe that the general structure of the network weights represents the training set's symmetry group, i.e., the relations between training items. As a consequence, linear networks generalize, i.e., reproduce items that were not part of the training set but are consistent with the symmetry of the training set. In contrast, non-linear networks tend to learn individual training items and show associative memory. At the same time, their ability to generalize is limited. A higher degree of generalization is obtained for networks whose activation function contains a linear regime, such as tanh. Our results suggest ANN's ability to generalize - instead of learning items - could be improved by generating a sufficiently big set of elementary operations to represent relations and strongly depends on the applied non-linearity.</description>

      <title>Sup3r: A Semi-Supervised Algorithm for increasing Sparsity, Stability, and Separability in Hierarchy Of Time-Surfaces architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hierarchy Of Time-Surfaces (HOTS) algorithm, a neuromorphic approach for feature extraction from event data, presents promising capabilities but faces challenges in accuracy and compatibility with neuromorphic hardware. In this paper, we introduce Sup3r, a Semi-Supervised algorithm aimed at addressing these challenges. Sup3r enhances sparsity, stability, and separability in the HOTS networks. It enables end-to-end online training of HOTS networks replacing external classifiers, by leveraging semi-supervised learning. Sup3r learns class-informative patterns, mitigates confounding features, and reduces the number of processed events. Moreover, Sup3r facilitates continual and incremental learning, allowing adaptation to data distribution shifts and learning new tasks without forgetting. Preliminary results on N-MNIST demonstrate that Sup3r achieves comparable accuracy to similarly sized Artificial Neural Networks trained with back-propagation. This work showcases the potential of Sup3r to advance the capabilities of HOTS networks, offering a promising avenue for neuromorphic algorithms in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Hardware Aware Neural Architecture Search using Hardware Cost Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search approaches (HW-NAS) automate the design of deep learning architectures, tailored specifically to a given target hardware platform. Yet, these techniques demand substantial computational resources, primarily due to the expensive process of assessing the performance of identified architectures. To alleviate this problem, a recent direction in the literature has employed representation similarity metric for efficiently evaluating architecture performance. Nonetheless, since it is inherently a single objective method, it requires multiple runs to identify the optimal architecture set satisfying the diverse hardware cost constraints, thereby increasing the search cost. Furthermore, simply converting the single objective into a multi-objective approach results in an under-explored architectural search space. In this study, we propose a Multi-Objective method to address the HW-NAS problem, called MO-HDNAS, to identify the trade-off set of architectures in a single run with low computational cost. This is achieved by optimizing three objectives: maximizing the representation similarity metric, minimizing hardware cost, and maximizing the hardware cost diversity. The third objective, i.e. hardware cost diversity, is used to facilitate a better exploration of the architecture search space. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in efficiently addressing the HW-NAS problem across six edge devices for the image classification task.</description>

      <title>Group-wise Prompting for Synthetic Tabular Data Generation using Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating realistic synthetic tabular data presents a critical challenge in machine learning. This study introduces a simple yet effective method employing Large Language Models (LLMs) tailored to generate synthetic data, specifically addressing data imbalance problems. We propose a novel group-wise prompting method in CSV-style formatting that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs to produce data that closely adheres to the specified requirements and characteristics of the target dataset. Moreover, our proposed random word replacement strategy significantly improves the handling of monotonous categorical values, enhancing the accuracy and representativeness of the synthetic data. The effectiveness of our method is extensively validated across eight real-world public datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in downstream classification and regression tasks while maintaining inter-feature correlations and improving token efficiency over existing approaches. This advancement significantly contributes to addressing the key challenges of machine learning applications, particularly in the context of tabular data generation and handling class imbalance.

      <title>mOthello: When Do Cross-Lingual Representation Alignment and Cross-Lingual Transfer Emerge in Multilingual Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many pretrained multilingual models exhibit cross-lingual transfer ability, which is often attributed to a learned language-neutral representation during pretraining. However, it remains unclear what factors contribute to the learning of a language-neutral representation, and whether the learned language-neutral representation suffices to facilitate cross-lingual transfer. We propose a synthetic task, Multilingual Othello (mOthello), as a testbed to delve into these two questions. We find that: (1) models trained with naive multilingual pretraining fail to learn a language-neutral representation across all input languages; (2) the introduction of "anchor tokens" (i.e., lexical items that are identical across languages) helps cross-lingual representation alignment; and (3) the learning of a language-neutral representation alone is not sufficient to facilitate cross-lingual transfer. Based on our findings, we propose a novel approach - multilingual pretraining with unified output space - that both induces the learning of language-neutral representation and facilitates cross-lingual transfer.</description>

      <title>Enhancing AI Diagnostics: Autonomous Lesion Masking via Semi-Supervised Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an unsupervised domain adaptation method aimed at autonomously generating image masks outlining regions of interest (ROIs) for differentiating breast lesions in breast ultrasound (US) imaging. Our semi-supervised learning approach utilizes a primitive model trained on a small public breast US dataset with true annotations. This model is then iteratively refined for the domain adaptation task, generating pseudo-masks for our private, unannotated breast US dataset. The dataset, twice the size of the public one, exhibits considerable variability in image acquisition perspectives and demographic representation, posing a domain-shift challenge. Unlike typical domain adversarial training, we employ downstream classification outcomes as a benchmark to guide the updating of pseudo-masks in subsequent iterations. We found the classification precision to be highly correlated with the completeness of the generated ROIs, which promotes the explainability of the deep learning classification model. Preliminary findings demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of this approach in streamlining the ROI annotation process, thereby enhancing the classification and localization of breast lesions for more precise and interpretable diagnoses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Platooning of autonomous vehicles has the potential to increase safety and fuel efficiency on highways. The goal of platooning is to have each vehicle drive at some speed (set by the leader) while maintaining a safe distance from its neighbors. Many prior works have analyzed various controllers for platooning, most commonly linear feedback and distributed model predictive controllers. In this work, we introduce an algorithm for learning a stable, safe, distributed controller for a heterogeneous platoon. Our algorithm relies on recent developments in learning neural network stability and safety certificates. We train a controller for autonomous platooning in simulation and evaluate its performance on hardware with a platoon of four F1Tenth vehicles. We then perform further analysis in simulation with a platoon of 100 vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate the practicality of the algorithm and the learned controller by comparing the performance of the neural network controller to linear feedback and distributed model predictive controllers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contract scheduling is a widely studied framework for designing real-time systems with interruptible capabilities. Previous work has showed that a prediction on the interruption time can help improve the performance of contract-based systems, however it has relied on a single prediction that is provided by a deterministic oracle. In this work, we introduce and study more general and realistic learning-augmented settings in which the prediction is in the form of a probability distribution, or it is given as a set of multiple possible interruption times. For both prediction settings, we design and analyze schedules which perform optimally if the prediction is accurate, while simultaneously guaranteeing the best worst-case performance if the prediction is adversarial. We also provide evidence that the resulting system is robust to prediction errors in the distributional setting. Last, we present an experimental evaluation that confirms the theoretical findings, and illustrates the performance improvements that can be attained in practice.</description>

      <title>Global Counterfactual Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite increasing progress in development of methods for generating visual counterfactual explanations, especially with the recent rise of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, previous works consider them as an entirely local technique. In this work, we take the first step at globalizing them. Specifically, we discover that the latent space of Diffusion Autoencoders encodes the inference process of a given classifier in the form of global directions. We propose a novel proxy-based approach that discovers two types of these directions with the use of only single image in an entirely black-box manner. Precisely, g-directions allow for flipping the decision of a given classifier on an entire dataset of images, while h-directions further increase the diversity of explanations. We refer to them in general as Global Counterfactual Directions (GCDs). Moreover, we show that GCDs can be naturally combined with Latent Integrated Gradients resulting in a new black-box attribution method, while simultaneously enhancing the understanding of counterfactual explanations. We validate our approach on existing benchmarks and show that it generalizes to real-world use-cases.</description>

Abstract: Information extraction (IE) is an important task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), involving the extraction of named entities and their relationships from unstructured text. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to this task by formulating it as graph structure learning (GSL). By formulating IE as GSL, we enhance the model's ability to dynamically refine and optimize the graph structure during the extraction process. This formulation allows for better interaction and structure-informed decisions for entity and relation prediction, in contrast to previous models that have separate or untied predictions for these tasks. When compared against state-of-the-art baselines on joint entity and relation extraction benchmarks, our model, GraphER, achieves competitive results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint entity and relation extraction plays a pivotal role in various applications, notably in the construction of knowledge graphs. Despite recent progress, existing approaches often fall short in two key aspects: richness of representation and coherence in output structure. These models often rely on handcrafted heuristics for computing entity and relation representations, potentially leading to loss of crucial information. Furthermore, they disregard task and/or dataset-specific constraints, resulting in output structures that lack coherence. In our work, we introduce EnriCo, which mitigates these shortcomings. Firstly, to foster rich and expressive representation, our model leverage attention mechanisms that allow both entities and relations to dynamically determine the pertinent information required for accurate extraction. Secondly, we introduce a series of decoding algorithms designed to infer the highest scoring solutions while adhering to task and dataset-specific constraints, thus promoting structured and coherent outputs. Our model demonstrates competitive performance compared to baselines when evaluated on Joint IE datasets.</description>

Abstract: There have been growing discussions on estimating and subsequently reducing the operational carbon footprint of enterprise data centers. The design and intelligent control for data centers have an important impact on data center carbon footprint. In this paper, we showcase PyDCM, a Python library that enables extremely fast prototyping of data center design and applies reinforcement learning-enabled control with the purpose of evaluating key sustainability metrics including carbon footprint, energy consumption, and observing temperature hotspots. We demonstrate these capabilities of PyDCM and compare them to existing works in EnergyPlus for modeling data centers. PyDCM can also be used as a standalone Gymnasium environment for demonstrating sustainability-focused data center control.</description>

      <title>Compositional Neural Textures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Texture plays a vital role in enhancing visual richness in both real photographs and computer-generated imagery. However, the process of editing textures often involves laborious and repetitive manual adjustments of textons, which are the small, recurring local patterns that define textures. In this work, we introduce a fully unsupervised approach for representing textures using a compositional neural model that captures individual textons. We represent each texton as a 2D Gaussian function whose spatial support approximates its shape, and an associated feature that encodes its detailed appearance. By modeling a texture as a discrete composition of Gaussian textons, the representation offers both expressiveness and ease of editing. Textures can be edited by modifying the compositional Gaussians within the latent space, and new textures can be efficiently synthesized by feeding the modified Gaussians through a generator network in a feed-forward manner. This approach enables a wide range of applications, including transferring appearance from an image texture to another image, diversifying textures, texture interpolation, revealing/modifying texture variations, edit propagation, texture animation, and direct texton manipulation. The proposed approach contributes to advancing texture analysis, modeling, and editing techniques, and opens up new possibilities for creating visually appealing images with controllable textures.</description>

      <title>Neural Active Learning Beyond Bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study both stream-based and pool-based active learning with neural network approximations. A recent line of works proposed bandit-based approaches that transformed active learning into a bandit problem, achieving both theoretical and empirical success. However, the performance and computational costs of these methods may be susceptible to the number of classes, denoted as $K$, due to this transformation. Therefore, this paper seeks to answer the question: "How can we mitigate the adverse impacts of $K$ while retaining the advantages of principled exploration and provable performance guarantees in active learning?" To tackle this challenge, we propose two algorithms based on the newly designed exploitation and exploration neural networks for stream-based and pool-based active learning. Subsequently, we provide theoretical performance guarantees for both algorithms in a non-parametric setting, demonstrating a slower error-growth rate concerning $K$ for the proposed approaches. We use extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed algorithms, which consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>HalluciBot: Is There No Such Thing as a Bad Question?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hallucination continues to be one of the most critical challenges in the institutional adoption journey of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this context, an overwhelming number of studies have focused on analyzing the post-generation phase - refining outputs via feedback, analyzing logit output values, or deriving clues via the outputs' artifacts. We propose HalluciBot, a model that predicts the probability of hallucination $\textbf{before generation}$, for any query imposed to an LLM. In essence, HalluciBot does not invoke any generation during inference. To derive empirical evidence for HalluciBot, we employ a Multi-Agent Monte Carlo Simulation using a Query Perturbator to craft $n$ variations per query at train time. The construction of our Query Perturbator is motivated by our introduction of a new definition of hallucination - $\textit{truthful hallucination}$. Our training methodology generated 2,219,022 estimates for a training corpus of 369,837 queries, spanning 13 diverse datasets and 3 question-answering scenarios. HalluciBot predicts both binary and multi-class probabilities of hallucination, enabling a means to judge the query's quality with regards to its propensity to hallucinate. Therefore, HalluciBot paves the way to revise or cancel a query before generation and the ensuing computational waste. Moreover, it provides a lucid means to measure user accountability for hallucinatory queries.</description>

      <title>Multi-View Subgraph Neural Networks: Self-Supervised Learning with Scarce Labeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the de-facto standard for graph-based node classification, they impose a strong assumption on the availability of sufficient labeled samples. This assumption restricts the classification performance of prevailing GNNs on many real-world applications suffering from low-data regimes. Specifically, features extracted from scarce labeled nodes could not provide sufficient supervision for the unlabeled samples, leading to severe over-fitting. In this work, we point out that leveraging subgraphs to capture long-range dependencies can augment the representation of a node with homophily properties, thus alleviating the low-data regime. However, prior works leveraging subgraphs fail to capture the long-range dependencies among nodes. To this end, we present a novel self-supervised learning framework, called multi-view subgraph neural networks (Muse), for handling long-range dependencies. In particular, we propose an information theory-based identification mechanism to identify two types of subgraphs from the views of input space and latent space, respectively. The former is to capture the local structure of the graph, while the latter captures the long-range dependencies among nodes. By fusing these two views of subgraphs, the learned representations can preserve the topological properties of the graph at large, including the local structure and long-range dependencies, thus maximizing their expressiveness for downstream node classification tasks. Experimental results show that Muse outperforms the alternative methods on node classification tasks with limited labeled data.</description>

      <title>iTBLS: A Dataset of Interactive Conversations Over Tabular Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Interactive Tables (iTBLS), a dataset of interactive conversations situated in tables from scientific articles. This dataset is designed to facilitate human-AI collaborative problem-solving through AI-powered multi-task tabular capabilities. In contrast to prior work that models interactions as factoid QA or procedure synthesis, iTBLS broadens the scope of interactions to include mathematical reasoning, natural language manipulation, and expansion of existing tables from natural language conversation by delineating interactions into one of three tasks: interpretation, modification, or generation. Additionally, the paper presents a suite of baseline approaches to iTBLS, utilizing zero-shot prompting and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for different computing situations. We also introduce a novel multi-step approach and show how it can be leveraged in conjunction with parameter-efficient fine-tuning to achieve the state-of-the-art on iTBLS; outperforming standard parameter-efficient fine-tuning by up to 15% on interpretation, 18% on modification, and 38% on generation.</description>

      <title>Random Network Distillation Based Deep Reinforcement Learning for AGV Path Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the flourishing development of intelligent warehousing systems, the technology of Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) has experienced rapid growth. Within intelligent warehousing environments, AGV is required to safely and rapidly plan an optimal path in complex and dynamic environments. Most research has studied deep reinforcement learning to address this challenge. However, in the environments with sparse extrinsic rewards, these algorithms often converge slowly, learn inefficiently or fail to reach the target. Random Network Distillation (RND), as an exploration enhancement, can effectively improve the performance of proximal policy optimization, especially enhancing the additional intrinsic rewards of the AGV agent which is in sparse reward environments. Moreover, most of the current research continues to use 2D grid mazes as experimental environments. These environments have insufficient complexity and limited action sets. To solve this limitation, we present simulation environments of AGV path planning with continuous actions and positions for AGVs, so that it can be close to realistic physical scenarios. Based on our experiments and comprehensive analysis of the proposed method, the results demonstrate that our proposed method enables AGV to more rapidly complete path planning tasks with continuous actions in our environments. A video of part of our experiments can be found at https://youtu.be/lwrY9YesGmw.</description>

      <title>Parameter Efficient Diverse Paraphrase Generation Using Sequence-Level Knowledge Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past year, the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG) has experienced an exponential surge, largely due to the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs). These models have exhibited the most effective performance in a range of domains within the Natural Language Processing and Generation domains. However, their application in domain-specific tasks, such as paraphrasing, presents significant challenges. The extensive number of parameters makes them difficult to operate on commercial hardware, and they require substantial time for inference, leading to high costs in a production setting. In this study, we tackle these obstacles by employing LLMs to develop three distinct models for the paraphrasing field, applying a method referred to as sequence-level knowledge distillation. These distilled models are capable of maintaining the quality of paraphrases generated by the LLM. They demonstrate faster inference times and the ability to generate diverse paraphrases of comparable quality. A notable characteristic of these models is their ability to exhibit syntactic diversity while also preserving lexical diversity, features previously uncommon due to existing data quality issues in datasets and not typically observed in neural-based approaches. Human evaluation of our models shows that there is only a 4% drop in performance compared to the LLM teacher model used in the distillation process, despite being 1000 times smaller. This research provides a significant contribution to the NLG field, offering a more efficient and cost-effective solution for paraphrasing tasks.</description>

      <title>CORI: CJKV Benchmark with Romanization Integration -- A step towards Cross-lingual Transfer Beyond Textual Scripts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Naively assuming English as a source language may hinder cross-lingual transfer for many languages by failing to consider the importance of language contact. Some languages are more well-connected than others, and target languages can benefit from transferring from closely related languages; for many languages, the set of closely related languages does not include English. In this work, we study the impact of source language for cross-lingual transfer, demonstrating the importance of selecting source languages that have high contact with the target language. We also construct a novel benchmark dataset for close contact Chinese-Japanese-Korean-Vietnamese (CJKV) languages to further encourage in-depth studies of language contact. To comprehensively capture contact between these languages, we propose to integrate Romanized transcription beyond textual scripts via Contrastive Learning objectives, leading to enhanced cross-lingual representations and effective zero-shot cross-lingual transfer.</description>

      <title>A Soft e-Textile Sensor for Enhanced Deep Learning-based Shape Sensing of Soft Continuum Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The safety and accuracy of robotic navigation hold paramount importance, especially in the realm of soft continuum robotics, where the limitations of traditional rigid sensors become evident. Encoders, piezoresistive, and potentiometer sensors often fail to integrate well with the flexible nature of these robots, adding unwanted bulk and rigidity. To overcome these hurdles, our study presents a new approach to shape sensing in soft continuum robots through the use of soft e-textile resistive sensors. This sensor, designed to flawlessly integrate with the robot's structure, utilizes a resistive material that adjusts its resistance in response to the robot's movements and deformations. This adjustment facilitates the capture of multidimensional force measurements across the soft sensor layers. A deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed to decode the sensor signals, enabling precise estimation of the robot's shape configuration based on the detailed data from the e-textile sensor. Our research investigates the efficacy of this e-textile sensor in determining the curvature parameters of soft continuum robots. The findings are encouraging, showing that the soft e-textile sensor not only matches but potentially exceeds the capabilities of traditional rigid sensors in terms of shape sensing and estimation. This advancement significantly boosts the safety and efficiency of robotic navigation systems.</description>

      <title>Breaching the Bottleneck: Evolutionary Transition from Reward-Driven Learning to Reward-Agnostic Domain-Adapted Learning in Neuromodulated Neural Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced biological intelligence learns efficiently from an information-rich stream of stimulus information, even when feedback on behaviour quality is sparse or absent. Such learning exploits implicit assumptions about task domains. We refer to such learning as Domain-Adapted Learning (DAL). In contrast, AI learning algorithms rely on explicit externally provided measures of behaviour quality to acquire fit behaviour. This imposes an information bottleneck that precludes learning from diverse non-reward stimulus information, limiting learning efficiency. We consider the question of how biological evolution circumvents this bottleneck to produce DAL. We propose that species first evolve the ability to learn from reward signals, providing inefficient (bottlenecked) but broad adaptivity. From there, integration of non-reward information into the learning process can proceed via gradual accumulation of biases induced by such information on specific task domains. This scenario provides a biologically plausible pathway towards bottleneck-free, domain-adapted learning. Focusing on the second phase of this scenario, we set up a population of NNs with reward-driven learning modelled as Reinforcement Learning (A2C), and allow evolution to improve learning efficiency by integrating non-reward information into the learning process using a neuromodulatory update mechanism. On a navigation task in continuous 2D space, evolved DAL agents show a 300-fold increase in learning speed compared to pure RL agents. Evolution is found to eliminate reliance on reward information altogether, allowing DAL agents to learn from non-reward information exclusively, using local neuromodulation-based connection weight updates only.</description>

Abstract: This study proposes a multi-modal fusion framework Multitrans based on the Transformer architecture and self-attention mechanism. This architecture combines the study of non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) images and discharge diagnosis reports of patients undergoing stroke treatment, using a variety of methods based on Transformer architecture approach to predicting functional outcomes of stroke treatment. The results show that the performance of single-modal text classification is significantly better than single-modal image classification, but the effect of multi-modal combination is better than any single modality. Although the Transformer model only performs worse on imaging data, when combined with clinical meta-diagnostic information, both can learn better complementary information and make good contributions to accurately predicting stroke treatment effects..</description>

      <title>Pre-trained Vision-Language Models Learn Discoverable Visual Concepts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Do vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained to caption an image of a "durian" learn visual concepts such as "brown" (color) and "spiky" (texture) at the same time? We aim to answer this question as visual concepts learned "for free" would enable wide applications such as neuro-symbolic reasoning or human-interpretable object classification. We assume that the visual concepts, if captured by pre-trained VLMs, can be extracted by their vision-language interface with text-based concept prompts. We observe that recent works prompting VLMs with concepts often differ in their strategies to define and evaluate the visual concepts, leading to conflicting conclusions. We propose a new concept definition strategy based on two observations: First, certain concept prompts include shortcuts that recognize correct concepts for wrong reasons; Second, multimodal information (e.g. visual discriminativeness, and textual knowledge) should be leveraged when selecting the concepts. Our proposed concept discovery and learning (CDL) framework is thus designed to identify a diverse list of generic visual concepts (e.g. "spiky" as opposed to "spiky durian"), which are ranked and selected based on visual and language mutual information. We carefully design quantitative and human evaluations of the discovered concepts on six diverse visual recognition datasets, which confirm that pre-trained VLMs do learn visual concepts that provide accurate and thorough descriptions for the recognized objects. All code and models are publicly released.</description>

      <title>Detecting Out-Of-Distribution Earth Observation Images with Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth Observation imagery can capture rare and unusual events, such as disasters and major landscape changes, whose visual appearance contrasts with the usual observations. Deep models trained on common remote sensing data will output drastically different features for these out-of-distribution samples, compared to those closer to their training dataset. Detecting them could therefore help anticipate changes in the observations, either geographical or environmental. In this work, we show that the reconstruction error of diffusion models can effectively serve as unsupervised out-of-distribution detectors for remote sensing images, using them as a plausibility score. Moreover, we introduce ODEED, a novel reconstruction-based scorer using the probability-flow ODE of diffusion models. We validate it experimentally on SpaceNet 8 with various scenarios, such as classical OOD detection with geographical shift and near-OOD setups: pre/post-flood and non-flooded/flooded image recognition. We show that our ODEED scorer significantly outperforms other diffusion-based and discriminative baselines on the more challenging near-OOD scenarios of flood image detection, where OOD images are close to the distribution tail. We aim to pave the way towards better use of generative models for anomaly detection in remote sensing.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Understand Computer Networks? Towards a Virtual System Administrator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence, and particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), offer promising prospects for aiding system administrators in managing the complexity of modern networks. However, despite this potential, a significant gap exists in the literature regarding the extent to which LLMs can understand computer networks. Without empirical evidence, system administrators might rely on these models without assurance of their efficacy in performing network-related tasks accurately.
  In this paper, we are the first to conduct an exhaustive study on LLMs' comprehension of computer networks. We formulate several research questions to determine whether LLMs can provide correct answers when supplied with a network topology and questions on it. To assess them, we developed a thorough framework for evaluating LLMs' capabilities in various network-related tasks. We evaluate our framework on multiple computer networks employing private (e.g., GPT4) and open-source (e.g., Llama2) models. Our findings demonstrate promising results, with the best model achieving an average accuracy of 79.3%. Private LLMs achieve noteworthy results in small and medium networks, while challenges persist in comprehending complex network topologies, particularly for open-source models. Moreover, we provide insight into how prompt engineering can enhance the accuracy of some tasks.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Temperature Knowledge Distillation</title>

Abstract: Temperature plays a pivotal role in moderating label softness in the realm of knowledge distillation (KD). Traditional approaches often employ a static temperature throughout the KD process, which fails to address the nuanced complexities of samples with varying levels of difficulty and overlooks the distinct capabilities of different teacher-student pairings. This leads to a less-than-ideal transfer of knowledge. To improve the process of knowledge propagation, we proposed Dynamic Temperature Knowledge Distillation (DTKD) which introduces a dynamic, cooperative temperature control for both teacher and student models simultaneously within each training iterafion. In particular, we proposed "\textbf{sharpness}" as a metric to quantify the smoothness of a model's output distribution. By minimizing the sharpness difference between the teacher and the student, we can derive sample-specific temperatures for them respectively. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-2012 demonstrate that DTKD performs comparably to leading KD techniques, with added robustness in Target Class KD and None-target Class KD scenarios.The code is available at https://github.com/JinYu1998/DTKD.</description>

      <title>uTRAND: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Traffic Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based approaches have achieved significant improvements on public video anomaly datasets, but often do not perform well in real-world applications. This paper addresses two issues: the lack of labeled data and the difficulty of explaining the predictions of a neural network. To this end, we present a framework called uTRAND, that shifts the problem of anomalous trajectory prediction from the pixel space to a semantic-topological domain. The framework detects and tracks all types of traffic agents in bird's-eye-view videos of traffic cameras mounted at an intersection. By conceptualizing the intersection as a patch-based graph, it is shown that the framework learns and models the normal behaviour of traffic agents without costly manual labeling. Furthermore, uTRAND allows to formulate simple rules to classify anomalous trajectories in a way suited for human interpretation. We show that uTRAND outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on a dataset of anomalous trajectories collected in a real-world setting, while producing explainable detection results.</description>

      <title>Show and Grasp: Few-shot Semantic Segmentation for Robot Grasping through Zero-shot Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of a robot to pick an object, known as robot grasping, is crucial for several applications, such as assembly or sorting. In such tasks, selecting the right target to pick is as essential as inferring a correct configuration of the gripper. A common solution to this problem relies on semantic segmentation models, which often show poor generalization to unseen objects and require considerable time and massive data to be trained. To reduce the need for large datasets, some grasping pipelines exploit few-shot semantic segmentation models, which are capable of recognizing new classes given a few examples. However, this often comes at the cost of limited performance and fine-tuning is required to be effective in robot grasping scenarios. In this work, we propose to overcome all these limitations by combining the impressive generalization capability reached by foundation models with a high-performing few-shot classifier, working as a score function to select the segmentation that is closer to the support set. The proposed model is designed to be embedded in a grasp synthesis pipeline. The extensive experiments using one or five examples show that our novel approach overcomes existing performance limitations, improving the state of the art both in few-shot semantic segmentation on the Graspnet-1B (+10.5% mIoU) and Ocid-grasp (+1.6% AP) datasets, and real-world few-shot grasp synthesis (+21.7% grasp accuracy).

      <title>Generalized Few-Shot Meets Remote Sensing: Discovering Novel Classes in Land Cover Mapping via Hybrid Semantic Segmentation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Land-cover mapping is one of the vital applications in Earth observation, aiming at classifying each pixel's land-cover type of remote-sensing images. As natural and human activities change the landscape, the land-cover map needs to be rapidly updated. However, discovering newly appeared land-cover types in existing classification systems is still a non-trivial task hindered by various scales of complex land objects and insufficient labeled data over a wide-span geographic area. In this paper, we propose a generalized few-shot segmentation-based framework, named SegLand, to update novel classes in high-resolution land-cover mapping. Specifically, the proposed framework is designed in three parts: (a) Data pre-processing: the base training set and the few-shot support sets of novel classes are analyzed and augmented; (b) Hybrid segmentation structure; Multiple base learners and a modified Projection onto Orthogonal Prototypes (POP) network are combined to enhance the base-class recognition and to dig novel classes from insufficient labels data; (c) Ultimate fusion: the semantic segmentation results of the base learners and POP network are reasonably fused. The proposed framework has won first place in the leaderboard of the OpenEarthMap Land Cover Mapping Few-Shot Challenge. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the framework for automatically updating novel land-cover classes with limited labeled data.</description>

      <title>Beyond Human Norms: Unveiling Unique Values of Large Language Models through Interdisciplinary Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the AI field but also pose potential safety and ethical risks. Deciphering LLMs' embedded values becomes crucial for assessing and mitigating their risks. Despite extensive investigation into LLMs' values, previous studies heavily rely on human-oriented value systems in social sciences. Then, a natural question arises: Do LLMs possess unique values beyond those of humans? Delving into it, this work proposes a novel framework, ValueLex, to reconstruct LLMs' unique value system from scratch, leveraging psychological methodologies from human personality/value research. Based on Lexical Hypothesis, ValueLex introduces a generative approach to elicit diverse values from 30+ LLMs, synthesizing a taxonomy that culminates in a comprehensive value framework via factor analysis and semantic clustering. We identify three core value dimensions, Competence, Character, and Integrity, each with specific subdimensions, revealing that LLMs possess a structured, albeit non-human, value system. Based on this system, we further develop tailored projective tests to evaluate and analyze the value inclinations of LLMs across different model sizes, training methods, and data sources. Our framework fosters an interdisciplinary paradigm of understanding LLMs, paving the way for future AI alignment and regulation.</description>

      <title>AutoCrawler: A Progressive Understanding Web Agent for Web Crawler Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Web automation is a significant technique that accomplishes complicated web tasks by automating common web actions, enhancing operational efficiency, and reducing the need for manual intervention. Traditional methods, such as wrappers, suffer from limited adaptability and scalability when faced with a new website. On the other hand, generative agents empowered by large language models (LLMs) exhibit poor performance and reusability in open-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce a crawler generation task for vertical information web pages and the paradigm of combining LLMs with crawlers, which helps crawlers handle diverse and changing web environments more efficiently. We propose AutoCrawler, a two-stage framework that leverages the hierarchical structure of HTML for progressive understanding. Through top-down and step-back operations, AutoCrawler can learn from erroneous actions and continuously prune HTML for better action generation. We conduct comprehensive experiments with multiple LLMs and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

      <title>Adaptive Regularization of Representation Rank as an Implicit Constraint of Bellman Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representation rank is an important concept for understanding the role of Neural Networks (NNs) in Deep Reinforcement learning (DRL), which measures the expressive capacity of value networks. Existing studies focus on unboundedly maximizing this rank; nevertheless, that approach would introduce overly complex models in the learning, thus undermining performance. Hence, fine-tuning representation rank presents a challenging and crucial optimization problem. To address this issue, we find a guiding principle for adaptive control of the representation rank. We employ the Bellman equation as a theoretical foundation and derive an upper bound on the cosine similarity of consecutive state-action pairs representations of value networks. We then leverage this upper bound to propose a novel regularizer, namely BEllman Equation-based automatic rank Regularizer (BEER). This regularizer adaptively regularizes the representation rank, thus improving the DRL agent's performance. We first validate the effectiveness of automatic control of rank on illustrative experiments. Then, we scale up BEER to complex continuous control tasks by combining it with the deterministic policy gradient method. Among 12 challenging DeepMind control tasks, BEER outperforms the baselines by a large margin. Besides, BEER demonstrates significant advantages in Q-value approximation. Our code is available at https://github.com/sweetice/BEER-ICLR2024.</description>

      <title>MixLight: Borrowing the Best of both Spherical Harmonics and Gaussian Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately estimating scene lighting is critical for applications such as mixed reality. Existing works estimate illumination by generating illumination maps or regressing illumination parameters. However, the method of generating illumination maps has poor generalization performance and parametric models such as Spherical Harmonic (SH) and Spherical Gaussian (SG) fall short in capturing high-frequency or low-frequency components. This paper presents MixLight, a joint model that utilizes the complementary characteristics of SH and SG to achieve a more complete illumination representation, which uses SH and SG to capture low-frequency ambient and high-frequency light sources respectively. In addition, a special spherical light source sparsemax (SLSparsemax) module that refers to the position and brightness relationship between spherical light sources is designed to improve their sparsity, which is significant but omitted by prior works. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MixLight surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on multiple metrics. In addition, experiments on Web Dataset also show that MixLight as a parametric method has better generalization performance than non-parametric methods.</description>

      <title>Sentiment-oriented Transformer-based Variational Autoencoder Network for Live Video Commenting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic live video commenting is with increasing attention due to its significance in narration generation, topic explanation, etc. However, the diverse sentiment consideration of the generated comments is missing from the current methods. Sentimental factors are critical in interactive commenting, and lack of research so far. Thus, in this paper, we propose a Sentiment-oriented Transformer-based Variational Autoencoder (So-TVAE) network which consists of a sentiment-oriented diversity encoder module and a batch attention module, to achieve diverse video commenting with multiple sentiments and multiple semantics. Specifically, our sentiment-oriented diversity encoder elegantly combines VAE and random mask mechanism to achieve semantic diversity under sentiment guidance, which is then fused with cross-modal features to generate live video comments. Furthermore, a batch attention module is also proposed in this paper to alleviate the problem of missing sentimental samples, caused by the data imbalance, which is common in live videos as the popularity of videos varies. Extensive experiments on Livebot and VideoIC datasets demonstrate that the proposed So-TVAE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of the quality and diversity of generated comments.

      <title>Efficient Learning of Fuzzy Logic Systems for Large-Scale Data Using Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type-1 and Interval Type-2 (IT2) Fuzzy Logic Systems (FLS) excel in handling uncertainty alongside their parsimonious rule-based structure. Yet, in learning large-scale data challenges arise, such as the curse of dimensionality and training complexity of FLSs. The complexity is due mainly to the constraints to be satisfied as the learnable parameters define FSs and the complexity of the center of the sets calculation method, especially of IT2-FLSs. This paper explicitly focuses on the learning problem of FLSs and presents a computationally efficient learning method embedded within the realm of Deep Learning (DL). The proposed method tackles the learning challenges of FLSs by presenting computationally efficient implementations of FLSs, thereby minimizing training time while leveraging mini-batched DL optimizers and automatic differentiation provided within the DL frameworks. We illustrate the efficiency of the DL framework for FLSs on benchmark datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General Type-2 (GT2) Fuzzy Logic Systems (FLSs) are perfect candidates to quantify uncertainty, which is crucial for informed decisions in high-risk tasks, as they are powerful tools in representing uncertainty. In this paper, we travel back in time to provide a new look at GT2-FLSs by adopting Zadeh's (Z) GT2 Fuzzy Set (FS) definition, intending to learn GT2-FLSs that are capable of achieving reliable High-Quality Prediction Intervals (HQ-PI) alongside precision. By integrating Z-GT2-FS with the \(\alpha\)-plane representation, we show that the design flexibility of GT2-FLS is increased as it takes away the dependency of the secondary membership function from the primary membership function. After detailing the construction of Z-GT2-FLSs, we provide solutions to challenges while learning from high-dimensional data: the curse of dimensionality, and integrating Deep Learning (DL) optimizers. We develop a DL framework for learning dual-focused Z-GT2-FLSs with high performances. Our study includes statistical analyses, highlighting that the Z-GT2-FLS not only exhibits high-precision performance but also produces HQ-PIs in comparison to its GT2 and IT2 fuzzy counterparts which have more learnable parameters. The results show that the Z-GT2-FLS has a huge potential in uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of generating Prediction Intervals (PIs) in high-risk scenarios by proposing enhancements for learning Interval Type-2 (IT2) Fuzzy Logic Systems (FLSs) to address their learning challenges. In this context, we first provide extra design flexibility to the Karnik-Mendel (KM) and Nie-Tan (NT) center of sets calculation methods to increase their flexibility for generating PIs. These enhancements increase the flexibility of KM in the defuzzification stage while the NT in the fuzzification stage. To address the large-scale learning challenge, we transform the IT2-FLS's constraint learning problem into an unconstrained form via parameterization tricks, enabling the direct application of deep learning optimizers. To address the curse of dimensionality issue, we expand the High-Dimensional Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (HTSK) method proposed for type-1 FLS to IT2-FLSs, resulting in the HTSK2 approach. Additionally, we introduce a framework to learn the enhanced IT2-FLS with a dual focus, aiming for high precision and PI generation. Through exhaustive statistical results, we reveal that HTSK2 effectively addresses the dimensionality challenge, while the enhanced KM and NT methods improved learning and enhanced uncertainty quantification performances of IT2-FLSs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Counterfactual Explanation Search with Diffusion Distance and Directional Coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A pressing issue in the adoption of AI models is the increasing demand for more human-centric explanations of their predictions. To advance towards more human-centric explanations, understanding how humans produce and select explanations has been beneficial. In this work, inspired by insights of human cognition we propose and test the incorporation of two novel biases to enhance the search for effective counterfactual explanations. Central to our methodology is the application of diffusion distance, which emphasizes data connectivity and actionability in the search for feasible counterfactual explanations. In particular, diffusion distance effectively weights more those points that are more interconnected by numerous short-length paths. This approach brings closely connected points nearer to each other, identifying a feasible path between them. We also introduce a directional coherence term that allows the expression of a preference for the alignment between the joint and marginal directional changes in feature space to reach a counterfactual. This term enables the generation of counterfactual explanations that align with a set of marginal predictions based on expectations of how the outcome of the model varies by changing one feature at a time. We evaluate our method, named Coherent Directional Counterfactual Explainer (CoDiCE), and the impact of the two novel biases against existing methods such as DiCE, FACE, Prototypes, and Growing Spheres. Through a series of ablation experiments on both synthetic and real datasets with continuous and mixed-type features, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Generative Modelling with High-Order Langevin Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion generative modelling (DGM) based on stochastic
  differential equations (SDEs) with
  score matching has achieved unprecedented results in data
  generation.
  In this paper, we propose a novel fast high-quality
  generative modelling method
  based on high-order
  Langevin dynamics (HOLD) with score matching.
  This motive is proved by third-order
  Langevin dynamics. By augmenting the
  previous SDEs, e.g.
  variance exploding or variance preserving SDEs
  for single-data variable processes, HOLD can simultaneously
  model position, velocity, and
  acceleration, thereby improving the quality
  and speed of the data
  generation at the same time.
  HOLD is composed of one Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
  and two Hamiltonians,
  which reduce the mixing time by two orders of magnitude.
  Empirical experiments for unconditional image generation on the
  public data set CIFAR-10 and CelebA-HQ show that the effect is significant in
  both Frechet inception distance (FID) and negative log-likelihood,
  and achieves the
  state-of-the-art FID of 1.85 on CIFAR-10.</description>

      <title>COIN: Counterfactual inpainting for weakly supervised semantic segmentation for medical images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning is dramatically transforming the field of medical imaging and radiology, enabling the identification of pathologies in medical images, including computed tomography (CT) and X-ray scans. However, the performance of deep learning models, particularly in segmentation tasks, is often limited by the need for extensive annotated datasets. To address this challenge, the capabilities of weakly supervised semantic segmentation are explored through the lens of Explainable AI and the generation of counterfactual explanations. The scope of this research is development of a novel counterfactual inpainting approach (COIN) that flips the predicted classification label from abnormal to normal by using a generative model. For instance, if the classifier deems an input medical image X as abnormal, indicating the presence of a pathology, the generative model aims to inpaint the abnormal region, thus reversing the classifier's original prediction label. The approach enables us to produce precise segmentations for pathologies without depending on pre-existing segmentation masks. Crucially, image-level labels are utilized, which are substantially easier to acquire than creating detailed segmentation masks. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by segmenting synthetic targets and actual kidney tumors from CT images acquired from Tartu University Hospital in Estonia. The findings indicate that COIN greatly surpasses established attribution methods, such as RISE, ScoreCAM, and LayerCAM, as well as an alternative counterfactual explanation method introduced by Singla et al. This evidence suggests that COIN is a promising approach for semantic segmentation of tumors in CT images, and presents a step forward in making deep learning applications more accessible and effective in healthcare, where annotated data is scarce.</description>

      <title>ECOR: Explainable CLIP for Object Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have significantly contributed to various computer vision tasks, including object recognition and object detection. Their open vocabulary feature enhances their value. However, their black-box nature and lack of explainability in predictions make them less trustworthy in critical domains. Recently, some work has been done to force VLMs to provide reasonable rationales for object recognition, but this often comes at the expense of classification accuracy. In this paper, we first propose a mathematical definition of explainability in the object recognition task based on the joint probability distribution of categories and rationales, then leverage this definition to fine-tune CLIP in an explainable manner. Through evaluations of different datasets, our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in explainable classification. Notably, it excels in zero-shot settings, showcasing its adaptability. This advancement improves explainable object recognition, enhancing trust across diverse applications. The code will be made available online upon publication.</description>

      <title>Language-Driven Active Learning for Diverse Open-Set 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object detection is crucial for ensuring safe autonomous driving. However, data-driven approaches face challenges when encountering minority or novel objects in the 3D driving scene. In this paper, we propose VisLED, a language-driven active learning framework for diverse open-set 3D Object Detection. Our method leverages active learning techniques to query diverse and informative data samples from an unlabeled pool, enhancing the model's ability to detect underrepresented or novel objects. Specifically, we introduce the Vision-Language Embedding Diversity Querying (VisLED-Querying) algorithm, which operates in both open-world exploring and closed-world mining settings. In open-world exploring, VisLED-Querying selects data points most novel relative to existing data, while in closed-world mining, it mines new instances of known classes. We evaluate our approach on the nuScenes dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to random sampling and entropy-querying methods. Our results show that VisLED-Querying consistently outperforms random sampling and offers competitive performance compared to entropy-querying despite the latter's model-optimality, highlighting the potential of VisLED for improving object detection in autonomous driving scenarios.</description>

      <title>How Does the Textual Information Affect the Retrieval of Multimodal In-Context Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increase in parameter size of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) introduces significant capabilities, particularly in-context learning, where MLLMs enhance task performance without updating pre-trained parameters. This effectiveness, however, hinges on the appropriate selection of in-context examples, a process that is currently biased towards visual data, overlooking textual information. Furthermore, the area of supervised retrievers for MLLMs, crucial for optimal in-context example selection, continues to be uninvestigated. Our study offers an in-depth evaluation of the impact of textual information on the unsupervised selection of in-context examples in multimodal contexts, uncovering a notable sensitivity of retriever performance to the employed modalities. Responding to this, we introduce a novel supervised MLLM-retriever MSIER that employs a neural network to select examples that enhance multimodal in-context learning efficiency. This approach is validated through extensive testing across three distinct tasks, demonstrating the method's effectiveness. Additionally, we investigate the influence of modalities on our supervised retrieval method's training and pinpoint factors contributing to our model's success. This exploration paves the way for future advancements, highlighting the potential for refined in-context learning in MLLMs through the strategic use of multimodal data.</description>

      <title>A Large-scale Medical Visual Task Adaptation Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual task adaptation has been demonstrated to be effective in adapting pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) to general downstream visual tasks using specialized learnable layers or tokens. However, there is yet a large-scale benchmark to fully explore the effect of visual task adaptation on the realistic and important medical domain, particularly across diverse medical visual modalities, such as color images, X-ray, and CT. To close this gap, we present Med-VTAB, a large-scale Medical Visual Task Adaptation Benchmark consisting of 1.68 million medical images for diverse organs, modalities, and adaptation approaches. Based on Med-VTAB, we explore the scaling law of medical prompt tuning concerning tunable parameters and the generalizability of medical visual adaptation using non-medical/medical pre-train weights. Besides, we study the impact of patient ID out-of-distribution on medical visual adaptation, which is a real and challenging scenario. Furthermore, results from Med-VTAB indicate that a single pre-trained model falls short in medical task adaptation. Therefore, we introduce GMoE-Adapter, a novel method that combines medical and general pre-training weights through a gated mixture-of-experts adapter, achieving state-of-the-art results in medical visual task adaptation.</description>

      <title>Training-and-prompt-free General Painterly Harmonization Using Image-wise Attention Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Painterly Image Harmonization aims at seamlessly blending disparate visual elements within a single coherent image. However, previous approaches often encounter significant limitations due to training data constraints, the need for time-consuming fine-tuning, or reliance on additional prompts. To surmount these hurdles, we design a Training-and-prompt-Free General Painterly Harmonization method using image-wise attention sharing (TF-GPH), which integrates a novel "share-attention module". This module redefines the traditional self-attention mechanism by allowing for comprehensive image-wise attention, facilitating the use of a state-of-the-art pretrained latent diffusion model without the typical training data limitations. Additionally, we further introduce "similarity reweighting" mechanism enhances performance by effectively harnessing cross-image information, surpassing the capabilities of fine-tuning or prompt-based approaches. At last, we recognize the deficiencies in existing benchmarks and propose the "General Painterly Harmonization Benchmark", which employs range-based evaluation metrics to more accurately reflect real-world application. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior efficacy of our method across various benchmarks. The code and web demo are available at https://github.com/BlueDyee/TF-GPH.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Networking: Workflow, Advances and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The networking field is characterized by its high complexity and rapid iteration, requiring extensive expertise to accomplish network tasks, ranging from network design, diagnosis, configuration and security. The inherent complexity of these tasks, coupled with the ever-changing landscape of networking technologies and protocols, poses significant hurdles for traditional machine learning-based methods. These methods often struggle to generalize and automate complex tasks in networking, as they require extensive labeled data, domain-specific feature engineering, and frequent retraining to adapt to new scenarios. However, the recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a new wave of possibilities in addressing these challenges. LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, generation, and reasoning. These models, trained on extensive data, can benefit the networking domain. Some efforts have already explored the application of LLMs in the networking domain and revealed promising results. By reviewing recent advances, we present an abstract workflow to describe the fundamental process involved in applying LLM for Networking. We introduce the highlights of existing works by category and explain in detail how they operate at different stages of the workflow. Furthermore, we delve into the challenges encountered, discuss potential solutions, and outline future research prospects. We hope that this survey will provide insight for researchers and practitioners, promoting the development of this interdisciplinary research field.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Stitching in Reinforcement Learning using Relative Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning is a popular and powerful framework that takes full advantage of the Deep Learning breakthrough. However, it is also known that variations in the input (e.g., different colors of the panorama due to the season of the year) or the task (e.g., changing the speed limit for a car to respect) could require complete retraining of the agents. In this work, we leverage recent developments in unifying latent representations to demonstrate that it is possible to combine the components of an agent, rather than retrain it from scratch. We build upon the recent relative representations framework and adapt it for Visual RL. This allows us to create completely new agents capable of handling environment-task combinations never seen during training. Our work paves the road toward a more accessible and flexible use of reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Is Retain Set All You Need in Machine Unlearning? Restoring Performance of Unlearned Models with Out-Of-Distribution Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Selective-distillation for Class and Architecture-agnostic unleaRning (SCAR), a novel approximate unlearning method. SCAR efficiently eliminates specific information while preserving the model's test accuracy without using a retain set, which is a key component in state-of-the-art approximate unlearning algorithms. Our approach utilizes a modified Mahalanobis distance to guide the unlearning of the feature vectors of the instances to be forgotten, aligning them to the nearest wrong class distribution. Moreover, we propose a distillation-trick mechanism that distills the knowledge of the original model into the unlearning model with out-of-distribution images for retaining the original model's test performance without using any retain set. Importantly, we propose a self-forget version of SCAR that unlearns without having access to the forget set. We experimentally verified the effectiveness of our method, on three public datasets, comparing it with state-of-the-art methods. Our method obtains performance higher than methods that operate without the retain set and comparable w.r.t the best methods that rely on the retain set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) has emerged as a fundamental concept in the study of wide Neural Networks. In particular, it is known that the positivity of the NTK is directly related to the memorization capacity of sufficiently wide networks, i.e., to the possibility of reaching zero loss in training, via gradient descent. Here we will improve on previous works and obtain a sharp result concerning the positivity of the NTK of feedforward networks of any depth. More precisely, we will show that, for any non-polynomial activation function, the NTK is strictly positive definite. Our results are based on a novel characterization of polynomial functions which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Cross-cultural Inspiration Detection and Analysis in Real and LLM-generated Social Media Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspiration is linked to various positive outcomes, such as increased creativity, productivity, and happiness. Although inspiration has great potential, there has been limited effort toward identifying content that is inspiring, as opposed to just engaging or positive. Additionally, most research has concentrated on Western data, with little attention paid to other cultures. This work is the first to study cross-cultural inspiration through machine learning methods. We aim to identify and analyze real and AI-generated cross-cultural inspiring posts. To this end, we compile and make publicly available the InspAIred dataset, which consists of 2,000 real inspiring posts, 2,000 real non-inspiring posts, and 2,000 generated inspiring posts evenly distributed across India and the UK. The real posts are sourced from Reddit, while the generated posts are created using the GPT-4 model. Using this dataset, we conduct extensive computational linguistic analyses to (1) compare inspiring content across cultures, (2) compare AI-generated inspiring posts to real inspiring posts, and (3) determine if detection models can accurately distinguish between inspiring content across cultures and data sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deceptive reviews are becoming increasingly common, especially given the increase in performance and the prevalence of LLMs. While work to date has addressed the development of models to differentiate between truthful and deceptive human reviews, much less is known about the distinction between real reviews and AI-authored fake reviews. Moreover, most of the research so far has focused primarily on English, with very little work dedicated to other languages. In this paper, we compile and make publicly available the MAiDE-up dataset, consisting of 10,000 real and 10,000 AI-generated fake hotel reviews, balanced across ten languages. Using this dataset, we conduct extensive linguistic analyses to (1) compare the AI fake hotel reviews to real hotel reviews, and (2) identify the factors that influence the deception detection model performance. We explore the effectiveness of several models for deception detection in hotel reviews across three main dimensions: sentiment, location, and language. We find that these dimensions influence how well we can detect AI-generated fake reviews.</description>

      <title>Eyes Can Deceive: Benchmarking Counterfactual Reasoning Abilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning, as a crucial manifestation of human intelligence, refers to making presuppositions based on established facts and extrapolating potential outcomes. Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive cognitive and reasoning capabilities, which have been examined across a wide range of Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks. Nevertheless, how will existing MLLMs perform when faced with counterfactual questions? To answer this question, we first curate a novel \textbf{C}ounter\textbf{F}actual \textbf{M}ulti\textbf{M}odal reasoning benchmark, abbreviated as \textbf{CFMM}, to systematically assess the counterfactual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Our CFMM comprises six challenging tasks, each including hundreds of carefully human-labeled counterfactual questions, to evaluate MLLM's counterfactual reasoning capabilities across diverse aspects. Through experiments, interestingly, we find that existing MLLMs prefer to believe what they see, but ignore the counterfactual presuppositions presented in the question, thereby leading to inaccurate responses. Furthermore, we evaluate a wide range of prevalent MLLMs on our proposed CFMM. The significant gap between their performance on our CFMM and that on several VQA benchmarks indicates that there is still considerable room for improvement in existing MLLMs toward approaching human-level intelligence. On the other hand, through boosting MLLMs performances on our CFMM in the future, potential avenues toward developing MLLMs with advanced intelligence can be explored.</description>

      <title>Disentangling ID and Modality Effects for Session-based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Session-based recommendation aims to predict intents of anonymous users based on their limited behaviors. Modeling user behaviors involves two distinct rationales: co-occurrence patterns reflected by item IDs, and fine-grained preferences represented by item modalities (e.g., text and images). However, existing methods typically entangle these causes, leading to their failure in achieving accurate and explainable recommendations. To this end, we propose a novel framework DIMO to disentangle the effects of ID and modality in the task. At the item level, we introduce a co-occurrence representation schema to explicitly incorporate cooccurrence patterns into ID representations. Simultaneously, DIMO aligns different modalities into a unified semantic space to represent them uniformly. At the session level, we present a multi-view self-supervised disentanglement, including proxy mechanism and counterfactual inference, to disentangle ID and modality effects without supervised signals. Leveraging these disentangled causes, DIMO provides recommendations via causal inference and further creates two templates for generating explanations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the consistent superiority of DIMO over existing methods. Further analysis also confirms DIMO's effectiveness in generating explanations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation is dedicated to offering items of interest for users based on their history behaviors. The attribute-opinion pairs, expressed by users in their reviews for items, provide the potentials to capture user preferences and item characteristics at a fine-grained level. To this end, we propose a novel framework FineRec that explores the attribute-opinion pairs of reviews to finely handle sequential recommendation. Specifically, we utilize a large language model to extract attribute-opinion pairs from reviews. For each attribute, a unique attribute-specific user-opinion-item graph is created, where corresponding opinions serve as the edges linking heterogeneous user and item nodes. To tackle the diversity of opinions, we devise a diversity-aware convolution operation to aggregate information within the graphs, enabling attribute-specific user and item representation learning. Ultimately, we present an interaction-driven fusion mechanism to integrate attribute-specific user/item representations across all attributes for generating recommendations. Extensive experiments conducted on several realworld datasets demonstrate the superiority of our FineRec over existing state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis also verifies the effectiveness of our fine-grained manner in handling the task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease ranks as the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder globally. This research aims to develop a system leveraging Mixed Reality capabilities for tracking and assessing eye movements. In this paper, we present a medical scenario and outline the development of an application designed to capture eye-tracking signals through Mixed Reality technology for the evaluation of neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, we introduce a pipeline for extracting clinically relevant features from eye-gaze analysis, describing the capabilities of the proposed system from a medical perspective. The study involved a cohort of healthy control individuals and patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, showcasing the feasibility and potential of the proposed technology for non-intrusive monitoring of eye movement patterns for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.
  Clinical relevance - Developing a non-invasive biomarker for Parkinson's disease is urgently needed to accurately detect the disease's onset. This would allow for the timely introduction of neuroprotective treatment at the earliest stage and enable the continuous monitoring of intervention outcomes. The ability to detect subtle changes in eye movements allows for early diagnosis, offering a critical window for intervention before more pronounced symptoms emerge. Eye tracking provides objective and quantifiable biomarkers, ensuring reliable assessments of disease progression and cognitive function.

      <title>Goal Exploration via Adaptive Skill Distribution for Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploration efficiency poses a significant challenge in goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) tasks, particularly those with long horizons and sparse rewards. A primary limitation to exploration efficiency is the agent's inability to leverage environmental structural patterns. In this study, we introduce a novel framework, GEASD, designed to capture these patterns through an adaptive skill distribution during the learning process. This distribution optimizes the local entropy of achieved goals within a contextual horizon, enhancing goal-spreading behaviors and facilitating deep exploration in states containing familiar structural patterns. Our experiments reveal marked improvements in exploration efficiency using the adaptive skill distribution compared to a uniform skill distribution. Additionally, the learned skill distribution demonstrates robust generalization capabilities, achieving substantial exploration progress in unseen tasks containing similar local structures.</description>

      <title>FinLangNet: A Novel Deep Learning Framework for Credit Risk Prediction Using Linguistic Analogy in Financial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent industrial applications in risk prediction still heavily rely on extensively manually-tuned, statistical learning methods. Real-world financial data, characterized by its high-dimensionality, sparsity, high noise levels, and significant imbalance, poses unique challenges for the effective application of deep neural network models. In this work, we introduce a novel deep learning risk prediction framework, FinLangNet, which conceptualizes credit loan trajectories in a structure that mirrors linguistic constructs. This framework is tailored for credit risk prediction using real-world financial data, drawing on structural similarities to language by adapting natural language processing techniques. It focuses on analyzing the evolution and predictability of credit histories through detailed financial event sequences. Our research demonstrates that FinLangNet surpasses traditional statistical methods in predicting credit risk and that its integration with these methods enhances credit card fraud prediction models, achieving a significant improvement of over 1.5 points in the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric.</description>

      <title>Groma: Localized Visual Tokenization for Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Groma, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with grounded and fine-grained visual perception ability. Beyond holistic image understanding, Groma is adept at region-level tasks such as region captioning and visual grounding. Such capabilities are built upon a localized visual tokenization mechanism, where an image input is decomposed into regions of interest and subsequently encoded into region tokens. By integrating region tokens into user instructions and model responses, we seamlessly enable Groma to understand user-specified region inputs and ground its textual output to images. Besides, to enhance the grounded chat ability of Groma, we curate a visually grounded instruction dataset by leveraging the powerful GPT-4V and visual prompting techniques. Compared with MLLMs that rely on the language model or external module for localization, Groma consistently demonstrates superior performances in standard referring and grounding benchmarks, highlighting the advantages of embedding localization into image tokenization.

      <title>PhysDreamer: Physics-Based Interaction with 3D Objects via Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realistic object interactions are crucial for creating immersive virtual experiences, yet synthesizing realistic 3D object dynamics in response to novel interactions remains a significant challenge. Unlike unconditional or text-conditioned dynamics generation, action-conditioned dynamics requires perceiving the physical material properties of objects and grounding the 3D motion prediction on these properties, such as object stiffness. However, estimating physical material properties is an open problem due to the lack of material ground-truth data, as measuring these properties for real objects is highly difficult. We present PhysDreamer, a physics-based approach that endows static 3D objects with interactive dynamics by leveraging the object dynamics priors learned by video generation models. By distilling these priors, PhysDreamer enables the synthesis of realistic object responses to novel interactions, such as external forces or agent manipulations. We demonstrate our approach on diverse examples of elastic objects and evaluate the realism of the synthesized interactions through a user study. PhysDreamer takes a step towards more engaging and realistic virtual experiences by enabling static 3D objects to dynamically respond to interactive stimuli in a physically plausible manner. See our project page at https://physdreamer.github.io/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the LLM-ADE framework, a novel methodology for continued pre-training of large language models (LLMs) that addresses the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and double descent. LLM-ADE employs dynamic architectural adjustments, including selective block freezing and expansion, tailored to specific datasets. This strategy enhances model adaptability to new data while preserving previously acquired knowledge. We demonstrate LLM-ADE's effectiveness on the TinyLlama model across various general knowledge benchmarks, showing significant performance improvements without the drawbacks of traditional continuous training methods. This approach promises a more versatile and robust way to keep LLMs current and efficient in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Acting upon Imagination: when to trust imagined trajectories in model based reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.05716v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) aims to learn model(s) of the environment dynamics that can predict the outcome of its actions. Forward application of the model yields so called imagined trajectories (sequences of action, predicted state-reward) used to optimize the set of candidate actions that maximize expected reward. The outcome, an ideal imagined trajectory or plan, is imperfect and typically MBRL relies on model predictive control (MPC) to overcome this by continuously re-planning from scratch, incurring thus major computational cost and increasing complexity in tasks with longer receding horizon. We propose uncertainty estimation methods for online evaluation of imagined trajectories to assess whether further planned actions can be trusted to deliver acceptable reward. These methods include comparing the error after performing the last action with the standard expected error and using model uncertainty to assess the deviation from expected outcomes. Additionally, we introduce methods that exploit the forward propagation of the dynamics model to evaluate if the remainder of the plan aligns with expected results and assess the remainder of the plan in terms of the expected reward. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty estimation methods by applying them to avoid unnecessary trajectory replanning in a shooting MBRL setting. Results highlight significant reduction on computational costs without sacrificing performance.</description>

      <title>Learning Machine Morality through Experience and Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasing interest in ensuring safety of next-generation Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems calls for novel approaches to embedding morality into autonomous agents. Traditionally, this has been done by imposing explicit top-down rules or hard constraints on systems, for example by filtering system outputs through pre-defined ethical rules. Recently, instead, entirely bottom-up methods for learning implicit preferences from human behavior have become increasingly popular, such as those for training and fine-tuning Large Language Models. In this paper, we provide a systematization of existing approaches to the problem of introducing morality in machines - modeled as a continuum, and argue that the majority of popular techniques lie at the extremes - either being fully hard-coded, or entirely learned, where no explicit statement of any moral principle is required. Given the relative strengths and weaknesses of each type of methodology, we argue that more hybrid solutions are needed to create adaptable and robust, yet more controllable and interpretable agents.
  In particular, we present three case studies of recent works which use learning from experience (i.e., Reinforcement Learning) to explicitly provide moral principles to learning agents - either as intrinsic rewards, moral logical constraints or textual principles for language models. For example, using intrinsic rewards in Social Dilemma games, we demonstrate how it is possible to represent classical moral frameworks for agents. We also present an overview of the existing work in this area in order to provide empirical evidence for the potential of this hybrid approach. We then discuss strategies for evaluating the effectiveness of moral learning agents. Finally, we present open research questions and implications for the future of AI safety and ethics which are emerging from this framework.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Position Embedding of Graphs with Landmarks and Clustering for Link Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning positional information of nodes in a graph is important for link prediction tasks. We propose a representation of positional information using representative nodes called landmarks. A small number of nodes with high degree centrality are selected as landmarks, which serve as reference points for the nodes' positions. We justify this selection strategy for well-known random graph models and derive closed-form bounds on the average path lengths involving landmarks. In a model for power-law graphs, we prove that landmarks provide asymptotically exact information on inter-node distances. We apply theoretical insights to practical networks and propose Hierarchical Position embedding with Landmarks and Clustering (HPLC). HPLC combines landmark selection and graph clustering, where the graph is partitioned into densely connected clusters in which nodes with the highest degree are selected as landmarks. HPLC leverages the positional information of nodes based on landmarks at various levels of hierarchy such as nodes' distances to landmarks, inter-landmark distances and hierarchical grouping of clusters. Experiments show that HPLC achieves state-of-the-art performances of link prediction on various datasets in terms of HIT@K, MRR, and AUC. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/kmswin1/HPLC}.</description>

      <title>Re2LLM: Reflective Reinforcement Large Language Model for Session-based Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16427v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as promising approaches to enhance session-based recommendation (SBR), where both prompt-based and fine-tuning-based methods have been widely investigated to align LLMs with SBR. However, the former methods struggle with optimal prompts to elicit the correct reasoning of LLMs due to the lack of task-specific feedback, leading to unsatisfactory recommendations. Although the latter methods attempt to fine-tune LLMs with domain-specific knowledge, they face limitations such as high computational costs and reliance on open-source backbones. To address such issues, we propose a Reflective Reinforcement Large Language Model (Re2LLM) for SBR, guiding LLMs to focus on specialized knowledge essential for more accurate recommendations effectively and efficiently. In particular, we first design the Reflective Exploration Module to effectively extract knowledge that is readily understandable and digestible by LLMs. To be specific, we direct LLMs to examine recommendation errors through self-reflection and construct a knowledge base (KB) comprising hints capable of rectifying these errors. To efficiently elicit the correct reasoning of LLMs, we further devise the Reinforcement Utilization Module to train a lightweight retrieval agent. It learns to select hints from the constructed KB based on the task-specific feedback, where the hints can serve as guidance to help correct LLMs reasoning for better recommendations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

Abstract: We look at consciousness through the lens of Theoretical Computer Science, a branch of mathematics that studies computation under resource limitations. From this perspective, we develop a formal machine model for consciousness. The model is inspired by Alan Turing's simple yet powerful model of computation and Bernard Baars' theater model of consciousness. Though extremely simple, the model aligns at a high level with many of the major scientific theories of human and animal consciousness, supporting our claim that machine consciousness is inevitable.</description>

      <title>OWLOOP: Interfaces for Mapping OWL Axioms into OOP Hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper tackles the issue of mapping logic axioms formalised in the Ontology Web Language (OWL) within the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm. The issues of mapping OWL axioms hierarchies and OOP objects hierarchies are due to OWL-based reasoning algorithms, which might change an OWL hierarchy at runtime; instead, OOP hierarchies are usually defined as static structures. Although programming paradigms based on reflection allow changing the OOP hierarchies at runtime and mapping OWL axioms dynamically, there are no currently available mechanisms that do not limit the reasoning algorithms. Thus, the factory-based paradigm is typically used since it decouples the OWL and OOP hierarchies. However, the factory inhibits OOP polymorphism and introduces a paradigm shift with respect to widely accepted OOP paradigms. We present the OWLOOP API, which exploits the factory to not limit reasoning algorithms, and it provides novel OOP interfaces concerning the axioms in an ontology. OWLOOP is designed to limit the paradigm shift required for using ontologies while improving, through OOP-like polymorphism, the modularity of software architectures that exploit logic reasoning. The paper details our OWL to OOP mapping mechanism, and it shows the benefits and limitations of OWLOOP through examples concerning a robot in a smart environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown outstanding capabilities in many areas of multimodal reasoning. Therefore, we use the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models for environment description and scene understanding in complex transportation environments. In this paper, we propose AccidentBlip2, a multimodal large language model that can predict in real time whether an accident risk will occur. Our approach involves feature extraction based on the temporal scene of the six-view surround view graphs and temporal inference using the temporal blip framework through the vision transformer. We then input the generated temporal token into the MLLMs for inference to determine whether an accident will occur or not. Since AccidentBlip2 does not rely on any BEV images and LiDAR, the number of inference parameters and the inference cost of MLLMs can be significantly reduced, and it also does not incur a large training overhead during training. AccidentBlip2 outperforms existing solutions on the DeepAccident dataset and can also provide a reference solution for end-to-end automated driving accident prediction.</description>

      <title>AI-Based Automated Speech Therapy Tools for persons with Speech Sound Disorders: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.10325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic literature review of published studies on AI-based automated speech therapy tools for persons with speech sound disorders (SSD). The COVID-19 pandemic has initiated the requirement for automated speech therapy tools for persons with SSD making speech therapy accessible and affordable. However, there are no guidelines for designing such automated tools and their required degree of automation compared to human experts. In this systematic review, we followed the PRISMA framework to address four research questions: 1) what types of SSD do AI-based automated speech therapy tools address, 2) what is the level of autonomy achieved by such tools, 3) what are the different modes of intervention, and 4) how effective are such tools in comparison with human experts. An extensive search was conducted on digital libraries to find research papers relevant to our study from 2007 to 2022. The results show that AI-based automated speech therapy tools for persons with SSD are increasingly gaining attention among researchers. Articulation disorders were the most frequently addressed SSD based on the reviewed papers. Further, our analysis shows that most researchers proposed fully automated tools without considering the role of other stakeholders. Our review indicates that mobile-based and gamified applications were the most frequent mode of intervention. The results further show that only a few studies compared the effectiveness of such tools compared to expert Speech-Language Pathologists (SLP). Our paper presents the state-of-the-art in the field, contributes significant insights based on the research questions, and provides suggestions for future research directions.</description>

Abstract: Question answering systems are recognized as popular and frequently effective means of information seeking on the web. In such systems, information seekers can receive a concise response to their query by presenting their questions in natural language. Interactive question answering is a recently proposed and increasingly popular solution that resides at the intersection of question answering and dialogue systems. On the one hand, the user can ask questions in normal language and locate the actual response to her inquiry; on the other hand, the system can prolong the question-answering session into a dialogue if there are multiple probable replies, very few, or ambiguities in the initial request. By permitting the user to ask more questions, interactive question answering enables users to dynamically interact with the system and receive more precise results. This survey offers a detailed overview of the interactive question-answering methods that are prevalent in current literature. It begins by explaining the foundational principles of question-answering systems, hence defining new notations and taxonomies to combine all identified works inside a unified framework. The reviewed published work on interactive question-answering systems is then presented and examined in terms of its proposed methodology, evaluation approaches, and dataset/application domain. We also describe trends surrounding specific tasks and issues raised by the community, so shedding light on the future interests of scholars. Our work is further supported by a GitHub page with a synthesis of all the major topics covered in this literature study. https://sisinflab.github.io/interactive-question-answering-systems-survey/</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to learn sophisticated control policies for complex tasks including games, robotics, heating and cooling systems and text generation. The action-perception cycle in RL, however, generally assumes that a measurement of the state of the environment is available at each time step without a cost. In applications such as materials design, deep-sea and planetary robot exploration and medicine, however, there can be a high cost associated with measuring, or even approximating, the state of the environment. In this paper, we survey the recently growing literature that adopts the perspective that an RL agent might not need, or even want, a costly measurement at each time step. Within this context, we propose the Deep Dynamic Multi-Step Observationless Agent (DMSOA), contrast it with the literature and empirically evaluate it on OpenAI gym and Atari Pong environments. Our results, show that DMSOA learns a better policy with fewer decision steps and measurements than the considered alternative from the literature.</description>

Abstract: Data in tabular format is frequently occurring in real-world applications. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been extended to effectively handle such data, allowing feature interactions to be captured through representation learning. However, these approaches essentially produce black-box models, in the form of deep neural networks, precluding users from following the logic behind the model predictions. We propose an approach, called IGNNet (Interpretable Graph Neural Network for tabular data), which constrains the learning algorithm to produce an interpretable model, where the model shows how the predictions are exactly computed from the original input features. A large-scale empirical investigation is presented, showing that IGNNet is performing on par with state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms that target tabular data, including XGBoost, Random Forests, and TabNet. At the same time, the results show that the explanations obtained from IGNNet are aligned with the true Shapley values of the features without incurring any additional computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Aware Masked Autoencoders for Multimodal Pretraining on Biosignals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging multimodal information from biosignals is vital for building a comprehensive representation of people's physical and mental states. However, multimodal biosignals often exhibit substantial distributional shifts between pretraining and inference datasets, stemming from changes in task specification or variations in modality compositions. To achieve effective pretraining in the presence of potential distributional shifts, we propose a frequency-aware masked autoencoder ($\texttt{bio}$FAME) that learns to parameterize the representation of biosignals in the frequency space. $\texttt{bio}$FAME incorporates a frequency-aware transformer, which leverages a fixed-size Fourier-based operator for global token mixing, independent of the length and sampling rate of inputs. To maintain the frequency components within each input channel, we further employ a frequency-maintain pretraining strategy that performs masked autoencoding in the latent space. The resulting architecture effectively utilizes multimodal information during pretraining, and can be seamlessly adapted to diverse tasks and modalities at test time, regardless of input size and order. We evaluated our approach on a diverse set of transfer experiments on unimodal time series, achieving an average of $\uparrow$5.5% improvement in classification accuracy over the previous state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our architecture is robust in modality mismatch scenarios, including unpredicted modality dropout or substitution, proving its practical utility in real-world applications.

      <title>Channel Vision Transformers: An Image Is Worth 1 x 16 x 16 Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16108v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has emerged as a powerful architecture in the realm of modern computer vision. However, its application in certain imaging fields, such as microscopy and satellite imaging, presents unique challenges. In these domains, images often contain multiple channels, each carrying semantically distinct and independent information. Furthermore, the model must demonstrate robustness to sparsity in input channels, as they may not be densely available during training or testing. In this paper, we propose a modification to the ViT architecture that enhances reasoning across the input channels and introduce Hierarchical Channel Sampling (HCS) as an additional regularization technique to ensure robustness when only partial channels are presented during test time. Our proposed model, ChannelViT, constructs patch tokens independently from each input channel and utilizes a learnable channel embedding that is added to the patch tokens, similar to positional embeddings. We evaluate the performance of ChannelViT on ImageNet, JUMP-CP (microscopy cell imaging), and So2Sat (satellite imaging). Our results show that ChannelViT outperforms ViT on classification tasks and generalizes well, even when a subset of input channels is used during testing. Across our experiments, HCS proves to be a powerful regularizer, independent of the architecture employed, suggesting itself as a straightforward technique for robust ViT training. Lastly, we find that ChannelViT generalizes effectively even when there is limited access to all channels during training, highlighting its potential for multi-channel imaging under real-world conditions with sparse sensors. Our code is available at https://github.com/insitro/ChannelViT.</description>

      <title>SocREval: Large Language Models with the Socratic Method for Reference-Free Reasoning Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To comprehensively gauge the capacity of current models for complex reasoning, it is crucial to assess their step-by-step reasoning in a scalable manner. Established reference-based evaluation metrics rely on human-annotated reasoning chains as references to assess the model-derived chains. However, such "gold-standard" human-written reasoning chains may not be unique and their acquisition is often labor-intensive. Existing reference-free reasoning evaluation metrics, while eliminating the need for human-crafted reasoning chains as references, often require fine-tuning with human-derived chains before evaluation, complicating the process and questioning their adaptability to other datasets. To address these challenges, we harness GPT-4 to automatically evaluate reasoning chain quality, thereby removing the dependency on human-written reasoning chains for both model fine-tuning and evaluative purposes. Leveraging the Socratic method, we develop SocREval ({\bf Soc}ratic Method-Inspired {\bf R}easoning {\bf Eval}uation), a novel approach for prompt design in reference-free reasoning evaluation. Empirical results from four human annotated datasets reveal that SocREval significantly improves GPT-4's performance, surpassing existing reference-free and reference-based reasoning evaluation metrics. Beyond its demonstrated efficacy, SocREval, proves to be both cost-efficient and robust to prompt writing and example selection, as substantiated by our in-depth analysis.</description>

      <title>Lion Secretly Solves Constrained Optimization: As Lyapunov Predicts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05898v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lion (Evolved Sign Momentum), a new optimizer discovered through program search, has shown promising results in training large AI models. It performs comparably or favorably to AdamW but with greater memory efficiency. As we can expect from the results of a random search program, Lion incorporates elements from several existing algorithms, including signed momentum, decoupled weight decay, Polak, and Nesterov momentum, but does not fit into any existing category of theoretically grounded optimizers. Thus, even though Lion appears to perform well as a general-purpose optimizer for a wide range of tasks, its theoretical basis remains uncertain. This lack of theoretical clarity limits opportunities to further enhance and expand Lion's efficacy.
  This work aims to demystify Lion. Based on both continuous-time and discrete-time analysis, we demonstrate that Lion is a theoretically novel and principled approach for minimizing a general loss function $f(x)$ while enforcing a bound constraint $\|x\|_\infty \leq 1/\lambda$. Lion achieves this through the incorporation of decoupled weight decay, where $\lambda$ represents the weight decay coefficient. Our analysis is made possible by the development of a new Lyapunov function for the Lion updates. It applies to a broader family of Lion-$\kappa$ algorithms, where the $\text{sign}(\cdot)$ operator in Lion is replaced by the subgradient of a convex function $\kappa$, leading to the solution of a general composite optimization problem of $\min_x f(x) + \kappa^*(x)$. Our findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of Lion and pave the way for further improvements and extensions of Lion-related algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Survey on LLM-Generated Text Detection: Necessity, Methods, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The powerful ability to understand, follow, and generate complex language emerging from large language models (LLMs) makes LLM-generated text flood many areas of our daily lives at an incredible speed and is widely accepted by humans. As LLMs continue to expand, there is an imperative need to develop detectors that can detect LLM-generated text. This is crucial to mitigate potential misuse of LLMs and safeguard realms like artistic expression and social networks from harmful influence of LLM-generated content. The LLM-generated text detection aims to discern if a piece of text was produced by an LLM, which is essentially a binary classification task. The detector techniques have witnessed notable advancements recently, propelled by innovations in watermarking techniques, statistics-based detectors, neural-base detectors, and human-assisted methods. In this survey, we collate recent research breakthroughs in this area and underscore the pressing need to bolster detector research. We also delve into prevalent datasets, elucidating their limitations and developmental requirements. Furthermore, we analyze various LLM-generated text detection paradigms, shedding light on challenges like out-of-distribution problems, potential attacks, real-world data issues and the lack of effective evaluation framework. Conclusively, we highlight interesting directions for future research in LLM-generated text detection to advance the implementation of responsible artificial intelligence (AI). Our aim with this survey is to provide a clear and comprehensive introduction for newcomers while also offering seasoned researchers a valuable update in the field of LLM-generated text detection.

      <title>LitSumm: Large language models for literature summarisation of non-coding RNAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivation: Curation of literature in life sciences is a growing challenge. The continued increase in the rate of publication, coupled with the relatively fixed number of curators worldwide presents a major challenge to developers of biomedical knowledgebases. Very few knowledgebases have resources to scale to the whole relevant literature and all have to prioritise their efforts.
  Results: In this work, we take a first step to alleviating the lack of curator time in RNA science by generating summaries of literature for non-coding RNAs using large language models (LLMs). We demonstrate that high-quality, factually accurate summaries with accurate references can be automatically generated from the literature using a commercial LLM and a chain of prompts and checks. Manual assessment was carried out for a subset of summaries, with the majority being rated extremely high quality. We also applied the most commonly used automated evaluation approaches, finding that they do not correlate with human assessment. Finally, we apply our tool to a selection of over 4,600 ncRNAs and make the generated summaries available via the RNAcentral resource. We conclude that automated literature summarization is feasible with the current generation of LLMs, provided careful prompting and automated checking are applied.
  Availability: Code used to produce these summaries can be found here: https://github.com/RNAcentral/litscan-summarization and the dataset of contexts and summaries can be found here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/RNAcentral/litsumm-v1. Summaries are also displayed on the RNA report pages in RNAcentral (https://rnacentral.org/)</description>

      <title>Rephrase and Respond: Let Large Language Models Ask Better Questions for Themselves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Misunderstandings arise not only in interpersonal communication but also between humans and Large Language Models (LLMs). Such discrepancies can make LLMs interpret seemingly unambiguous questions in unexpected ways, yielding incorrect responses. While it is widely acknowledged that the quality of a prompt, such as a question, significantly impacts the quality of the response provided by LLMs, a systematic method for crafting questions that LLMs can better comprehend is still underdeveloped. In this paper, we present a method named `Rephrase and Respond' (RaR), which allows LLMs to rephrase and expand questions posed by humans and provide responses in a single prompt. This approach serves as a simple yet effective prompting method for improving performance. We also introduce a two-step variant of RaR, where a rephrasing LLM first rephrases the question and then passes the original and rephrased questions together to a different responding LLM. This facilitates the effective utilization of rephrased questions generated by one LLM with another. Our experiments demonstrate that our methods significantly improve the performance of different models across a wide range to tasks. We further provide a comprehensive comparison between RaR and the popular Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods, both theoretically and empirically. We show that RaR is complementary to CoT and can be combined with CoT to achieve even better performance. Our work not only contributes to enhancing LLM performance efficiently and effectively but also sheds light on a fair evaluation of LLM capabilities.

      <title>Empowering Multi-step Reasoning across Languages via Tree-of-Thoughts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reasoning methods, best exemplified by the well-known Chain-of-Thought (CoT), empower the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by eliciting them to solve complex tasks in a step-by-step manner. Although they are achieving significant success, the ability to deliver multi-step reasoning remains limited to English because of the imbalance in the distribution of pre-training data, which makes other languages a barrier. In this paper, we propose Cross-lingual Tree-of-Thoughts (Cross-ToT), a method for aligning Cross-lingual CoT reasoning across languages. The proposed method, through a self-consistent cross-lingual prompting mechanism inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts approach, provides multi-step reasoning paths in different languages that, during the steps, lead to the final solution. Experimental evaluations show that our method significantly outperforms existing prompting methods by reducing the number of interactions and achieving state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>When Large Language Models contradict humans? Large Language Models' Sycophantic Behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models have been demonstrating the ability to solve complex tasks by delivering answers that are positively evaluated by humans due in part to the intensive use of human feedback that refines responses. However, the suggestibility transmitted through human feedback increases the inclination to produce responses that correspond to the users' beliefs or misleading prompts as opposed to true facts, a behaviour known as sycophancy. This phenomenon decreases the bias, robustness, and, consequently, their reliability. In this paper, we shed light on the suggestibility of Large Language Models (LLMs) to sycophantic behaviour, demonstrating these tendencies via human-influenced prompts over different tasks. Our investigation reveals that LLMs show sycophantic tendencies when responding to queries involving subjective opinions and statements that should elicit a contrary response based on facts. In contrast, when confronted with mathematical tasks or queries that have an objective answer, these models at various scales seem not to follow the users' hints by demonstrating confidence in delivering the correct answers.</description>

      <title>An Embodied Generalist Agent in 3D World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging massive knowledge and learning schemes from large language models (LLMs), recent machine learning models show notable successes in building generalist agents that exhibit the capability of general-purpose task solving in diverse domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. However, a significant challenge remains as these models exhibit limited ability in understanding and interacting with the 3D world. We argue this limitation significantly hinders the current models from performing real-world tasks and further achieving general intelligence. To this end, we introduce an embodied multi-modal and multi-task generalist agent that excels in perceiving, grounding, reasoning, planning, and acting in the 3D world. Our proposed agent, referred to as LEO, is trained with shared LLM-based model architectures, objectives, and weights in two stages: (i) 3D vision-language alignment and (ii) 3D vision-language-action instruction tuning. To facilitate the training, we meticulously curate and generate an extensive dataset comprising object-level and scene-level multi-modal tasks with exceeding scale and complexity, necessitating a deep understanding of and interaction with the 3D world. Through rigorous experiments, we demonstrate LEO's remarkable proficiency across a wide spectrum of tasks, including 3D captioning, question answering, embodied reasoning, embodied navigation, and robotic manipulation. Our ablation results further provide valuable insights for the development of future embodied generalist agents.</description>

      <title>MultiModal-Learning for Predicting Molecular Properties: A Framework Based on Image and Graph Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quest for accurate prediction of drug molecule properties poses a fundamental challenge in the realm of Artificial Intelligence Drug Discovery (AIDD). An effective representation of drug molecules emerges as a pivotal component in this pursuit. Contemporary leading-edge research predominantly resorts to self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to extract meaningful structural representations from large-scale, unlabeled molecular data, subsequently fine-tuning these representations for an array of downstream tasks. However, an inherent shortcoming of these studies lies in their singular reliance on one modality of molecular information, such as molecule image or SMILES representations, thus neglecting the potential complementarity of various molecular modalities. In response to this limitation, we propose MolIG, a novel MultiModaL molecular pre-training framework for predicting molecular properties based on Image and Graph structures. MolIG model innovatively leverages the coherence and correlation between molecule graph and molecule image to execute self-supervised tasks, effectively amalgamating the strengths of both molecular representation forms. This holistic approach allows for the capture of pivotal molecular structural characteristics and high-level semantic information. Upon completion of pre-training, Graph Neural Network (GNN) Encoder is used for the prediction of downstream tasks. In comparison to advanced baseline models, MolIG exhibits enhanced performance in downstream tasks pertaining to molecular property prediction within benchmark groups such as MoleculeNet Benchmark Group and ADMET Benchmark Group.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Open-Vocabulary Caption Hallucinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While recent years have seen rapid progress in image-conditioned text generation, image captioning still suffers from the fundamental issue of hallucinations, namely, the generation of spurious details that cannot be inferred from the given image. Existing methods largely use closed-vocabulary object lists to mitigate or evaluate hallucinations in image captioning, ignoring the long-tailed nature of hallucinations that occur in practice. To this end, we propose a framework for addressing hallucinations in image captioning in the open-vocabulary setting. Our framework includes a new benchmark, OpenCHAIR, that leverages generative foundation models to evaluate open-vocabulary object hallucinations for image captioning, surpassing the popular and similarly-sized CHAIR benchmark in both diversity and accuracy. Furthermore, to mitigate open-vocabulary hallucinations without using a closed object list, we propose MOCHa, an approach harnessing advancements in reinforcement learning. Our multi-objective reward function explicitly targets the trade-off between fidelity and adequacy in generations without requiring any strong supervision. MOCHa improves a large variety of image captioning models, as captured by our OpenCHAIR benchmark and other existing metrics. We will release our code and models.</description>

      <title>Lite-Mind: Towards Efficient and Robust Brain Representation Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The limited data availability and the low signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI signals lead to the challenging task of fMRI-to-image retrieval. State-of-the-art MindEye remarkably improves fMRI-to-image retrieval performance by leveraging a large model, i.e., a 996M MLP Backbone per subject, to align fMRI embeddings to the final hidden layer of CLIP's Vision Transformer (ViT). However, significant individual variations exist among subjects, even under identical experimental setups, mandating the training of large subject-specific models. The substantial parameters pose significant challenges in deploying fMRI decoding on practical devices. To this end, we propose Lite-Mind, a lightweight, efficient, and robust brain representation learning paradigm based on Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), which efficiently aligns fMRI voxels to fine-grained information of CLIP. We elaborately design a DFT backbone with Spectrum Compression and Frequency Projector modules to learn informative and robust voxel embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that Lite-Mind achieves an impressive 94.6% fMRI-to-image retrieval accuracy on the NSD dataset for Subject 1, with 98.7% fewer parameters than MindEye. Lite-Mind is also proven to be able to be migrated to smaller fMRI datasets and establishes a new state-of-the-art for zero-shot classification on the GOD dataset.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancements of sensor technology and deep learning, autonomous driving systems are providing safe and efficient access to intelligent vehicles as well as intelligent transportation. Among these equipped sensors, the radar sensor plays a crucial role in providing robust perception information in diverse environmental conditions. This review focuses on exploring different radar data representations utilized in autonomous driving systems. Firstly, we introduce the capabilities and limitations of the radar sensor by examining the working principles of radar perception and signal processing of radar measurements. Then, we delve into the generation process of five radar representations, including the ADC signal, radar tensor, point cloud, grid map, and micro-Doppler signature. For each radar representation, we examine the related datasets, methods, advantages and limitations. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges faced in these data representations and propose potential research directions. Above all, this comprehensive review offers an in-depth insight into how these representations enhance autonomous system capabilities, providing guidance for radar perception researchers. To facilitate retrieval and comparison of different data representations, datasets and methods, we provide an interactive website at https://radar-camera-fusion.github.io/radar.</description>

      <title>Attacking Byzantine Robust Aggregation in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training modern neural networks or models typically requires averaging over a sample of high-dimensional vectors. Poisoning attacks can skew or bias the average vectors used to train the model, forcing the model to learn specific patterns or avoid learning anything useful. Byzantine robust aggregation is a principled algorithmic defense against such biasing. Robust aggregators can bound the maximum bias in computing centrality statistics, such as mean, even when some fraction of inputs are arbitrarily corrupted. Designing such aggregators is challenging when dealing with high dimensions. However, the first polynomial-time algorithms with strong theoretical bounds on the bias have recently been proposed. Their bounds are independent of the number of dimensions, promising a conceptual limit on the power of poisoning attacks in their ongoing arms race against defenses.
  In this paper, we show a new attack called HIDRA on practical realization of strong defenses which subverts their claim of dimension-independent bias. HIDRA highlights a novel computational bottleneck that has not been a concern of prior information-theoretic analysis. Our experimental evaluation shows that our attacks almost completely destroy the model performance, whereas existing attacks with the same goal fail to have much effect. Our findings leave the arms race between poisoning attacks and provable defenses wide open.</description>

      <title>HyKGE: A Hypothesis Knowledge Graph Enhanced Framework for Accurate and Reliable Medical LLMs Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based on Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to improve the accuracy and reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent approaches suffer from insufficient and repetitive knowledge retrieval, tedious and time-consuming query parsing, and monotonous knowledge utilization. To this end, we develop a Hypothesis Knowledge Graph Enhanced (HyKGE) framework, which leverages LLMs' powerful reasoning capacity to compensate for the incompleteness of user queries, optimizes the interaction process with LLMs, and provides diverse retrieved knowledge. Specifically, HyKGE explores the zero-shot capability and the rich knowledge of LLMs with Hypothesis Outputs to extend feasible exploration directions in the KGs, as well as the carefully curated prompt to enhance the density and efficiency of LLMs' responses. Furthermore, we introduce the HO Fragment Granularity-aware Rerank Module to filter out noise while ensuring the balance between diversity and relevance in retrieved knowledge. Experiments on two Chinese medical multiple-choice question datasets and one Chinese open-domain medical Q&amp;A dataset with two LLM turbos demonstrate the superiority of HyKGE in terms of accuracy and explainability.</description>

      <title>Routers in Vision Mixture of Experts: An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are a promising way to scale up model capacity without significantly increasing computational cost. A key component of MoEs is the router, which decides which subset of parameters (experts) process which feature embeddings (tokens). In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of routers in MoEs for computer vision tasks. We introduce a unified MoE formulation that subsumes different MoEs with two parametric routing tensors. This formulation covers both sparse MoE, which uses a binary or hard assignment between experts and tokens, and soft MoE, which uses a soft assignment between experts and weighted combinations of tokens. Routers for sparse MoEs can be further grouped into two variants: Token Choice, which matches experts to each token, and Expert Choice, which matches tokens to each expert. We conduct head-to-head experiments with 6 different routers, including existing routers from prior work and new ones we introduce. We show that (i) many routers originally developed for language modeling can be adapted to perform strongly in vision tasks, (ii) in sparse MoE, Expert Choice routers generally outperform Token Choice routers, and (iii) soft MoEs generally outperform sparse MoEs with a fixed compute budget. These results provide new insights regarding the crucial role of routers in vision MoE models.</description>

      <title>Improving Global Weather and Ocean Wave Forecast with Large Artificial Intelligence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technologies, particularly in recent years, has led to the emergence of several large parameter artificial intelligence weather forecast models. These models represent a significant breakthrough, overcoming the limitations of traditional numerical weather prediction models and indicating the emergence of profound potential tools for atmosphere-ocean forecasts. This study explores the evolution of these advanced artificial intelligence forecast models, and based on the identified commonalities, proposes the "Three Large Rules" to measure their development. We discuss the potential of artificial intelligence in revolutionizing numerical weather prediction, and briefly outlining the underlying reasons for its great potential. While acknowledging the high accuracy, computational efficiency, and ease of deployment of large artificial intelligence forecast models, we also emphasize the irreplaceable values of traditional numerical forecasts and explore the challenges in the future development of large-scale artificial intelligence atmosphere-ocean forecast models. We believe that the optimal future of atmosphere-ocean weather forecast lies in achieving a seamless integration of artificial intelligence and traditional numerical models. Such a synthesis is anticipated to offer a more advanced and reliable approach for improved atmosphere-ocean forecasts. Additionally, we illustrate how forecasters can adapt and leverage the advanced artificial intelligence model through an example by building a large artificial intelligence model for global ocean wave forecast.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model based Multi-Agents: A Survey of Progress and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide array of tasks. Due to the impressive planning and reasoning abilities of LLMs, they have been used as autonomous agents to do many tasks automatically. Recently, based on the development of using one LLM as a single planning or decision-making agent, LLM-based multi-agent systems have achieved considerable progress in complex problem-solving and world simulation. To provide the community with an overview of this dynamic field, we present this survey to offer an in-depth discussion on the essential aspects of multi-agent systems based on LLMs, as well as the challenges. Our goal is for readers to gain substantial insights on the following questions: What domains and environments do LLM-based multi-agents simulate? How are these agents profiled and how do they communicate? What mechanisms contribute to the growth of agents' capacities? For those interested in delving into this field of study, we also summarize the commonly used datasets or benchmarks for them to have convenient access. To keep researchers updated on the latest studies, we maintain an open-source GitHub repository, dedicated to outlining the research on LLM-based multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Policy Improvement using Language Feedback Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07876v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Language Feedback Models (LFMs) that identify desirable behaviour - actions that help achieve tasks specified in the instruction - for imitation learning in instruction following. To train LFMs, we obtain feedback from Large Language Models (LLMs) on visual trajectories verbalized to language descriptions. First, by using LFMs to identify desirable behaviour to imitate, we improve in task-completion rate over strong behavioural cloning baselines on three distinct language grounding environments (Touchdown, ScienceWorld, and ALFWorld). Second, LFMs outperform using LLMs as experts to directly predict actions, when controlling for the number of LLM output tokens. Third, LFMs generalize to unseen environments, improving task-completion rate by 3.5-12.0% through one round of adaptation. Finally, LFM can be modified to provide human-interpretable feedback without performance loss, allowing human verification of desirable behaviour for imitation learning.</description>

      <title>LLMBind: A Unified Modality-Task Integration Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14891v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the multi-modal domain, the dependence of various models on specific input formats leads to user confusion and hinders progress. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{LLMBind}, a novel framework designed to unify a diverse array of multi-modal tasks. By harnessing a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Model (LLM), LLMBind processes multi-modal inputs and generates task-specific tokens, enabling the invocation of corresponding models to accomplish tasks. This unique approach empowers LLMBind to interpret inputs and generate outputs across various modalities, including image, text, video, and audio. Furthermore, we have constructed an interaction dataset comprising 400k instructions, which unlocks the ability of LLMBind for interactive visual generation and editing tasks. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that LLMBind achieves very superior performance across diverse tasks and outperforms existing models in user evaluations conducted in real-world scenarios. Moreover, the adaptability of LLMBind allows for seamless integration with the latest models and extension to new modality tasks, highlighting its potential to serve as a unified AI agent for modeling universal modalities.</description>

      <title>What Generative Artificial Intelligence Means for Terminological Definitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools like ChatGPT on the creation and consumption of terminological definitions. From the terminologist's point of view, the strategic use of GenAI tools can streamline the process of crafting definitions, reducing both time and effort, while potentially enhancing quality. GenAI tools enable AI-assisted terminography, notably post-editing terminography, where the machine produces a definition that the terminologist then corrects or refines. However, the potential of GenAI tools to fulfill all the terminological needs of a user, including term definitions, challenges the very existence of terminological definitions and resources as we know them. Unlike terminological definitions, GenAI tools can describe the knowledge activated by a term in a specific context. However, a main drawback of these tools is that their output can contain errors. For this reason, users requiring reliability will likely still resort to terminological resources for definitions. Nevertheless, with the inevitable integration of AI into terminology work, the distinction between human-created and AI-created content will become increasingly blurred.</description>

      <title>BESA: Pruning Large Language Models with Blockwise Parameter-Efficient Sparsity Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various tasks, such as text summarization, text question-answering, and etc. While their performance is impressive, the computational footprint due to their vast number of parameters can be prohibitive. Existing solutions such as SparseGPT and Wanda attempt to alleviate this issue through weight pruning. However, their layer-wise approach results in significant perturbation to the model's output and requires meticulous hyperparameter tuning, such as the pruning rate, which can adversely affect overall model performance. To address this, this paper introduces a novel LLM pruning technique dubbed blockwise parameter-efficient sparsity allocation (BESA) by applying a blockwise reconstruction loss. In contrast to the typical layer-wise pruning techniques, BESA is characterized by two distinctive attributes: i) it targets the overall pruning error with respect to individual transformer blocks, and ii) it allocates layer-specific sparsity in a differentiable manner, both of which ensure reduced performance degradation after pruning. Our experiments show that BESA achieves state-of-the-art performance, efficiently pruning LLMs like LLaMA1, and LLaMA2 with 7B to 70B parameters on a single A100 GPU in just five hours. Code is available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/LLMPrune-BESA.</description>

      <title>Measuring Vision-Language STEM Skills of Neural Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new challenge to test the STEM skills of neural models. The problems in the real world often require solutions, combining knowledge from STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math). Unlike existing datasets, our dataset requires the understanding of multimodal vision-language information of STEM. Our dataset features one of the largest and most comprehensive datasets for the challenge. It includes 448 skills and 1,073,146 questions spanning all STEM subjects. Compared to existing datasets that often focus on examining expert-level ability, our dataset includes fundamental skills and questions designed based on the K-12 curriculum. We also add state-of-the-art foundation models such as CLIP and GPT-3.5-Turbo to our benchmark. Results show that the recent model advances only help master a very limited number of lower grade-level skills (2.5% in the third grade) in our dataset. In fact, these models are still well below (averaging 54.7%) the performance of elementary students, not to mention near expert-level performance. To understand and increase the performance on our dataset, we teach the models on a training split of our dataset. Even though we observe improved performance, the model performance remains relatively low compared to average elementary students. To solve STEM problems, we will need novel algorithmic innovations from the community.</description>

      <title>Flatten Long-Range Loss Landscapes for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) aims to acquire knowledge from limited training data in the target domain by leveraging prior knowledge transferred from source domains with abundant training samples. CDFSL faces challenges in transferring knowledge across dissimilar domains and fine-tuning models with limited training data. To address these challenges, we initially extend the analysis of loss landscapes from the parameter space to the representation space, which allows us to simultaneously interpret the transferring and fine-tuning difficulties of CDFSL models. We observe that sharp minima in the loss landscapes of the representation space result in representations that are hard to transfer and fine-tune. Moreover, existing flatness-based methods have limited generalization ability due to their short-range flatness. To enhance the transferability and facilitate fine-tuning, we introduce a simple yet effective approach to achieve long-range flattening of the minima in the loss landscape. This approach considers representations that are differently normalized as minima in the loss landscape and flattens the high-loss region in the middle by randomly sampling interpolated representations. We implement this method as a new normalization layer that replaces the original one in both CNNs and ViTs. This layer is simple and lightweight, introducing only a minimal number of additional parameters. Experimental results on 8 datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of average accuracy. Moreover, our method achieves performance improvements of up to 9\% compared to the current best approaches on individual datasets. Our code will be released.</description>

      <title>Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? The Misleading Success of Simulating Social Interactions With LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLM) have enabled richer social simulations, allowing for the study of various social phenomena. However, most recent work has used a more omniscient perspective on these simulations (e.g., single LLM to generate all interlocutors), which is fundamentally at odds with the non-omniscient, information asymmetric interactions that involve humans and AI agents in the real world. To examine these differences, we develop an evaluation framework to simulate social interactions with LLMs in various settings (omniscient, non-omniscient). Our experiments show that LLMs perform better in unrealistic, omniscient simulation settings but struggle in ones that more accurately reflect real-world conditions with information asymmetry. Our findings indicate that addressing information asymmetry remains a fundamental challenge for LLM-based agents.</description>

      <title>Non-negative Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep representations have shown promising performance when transferred to downstream tasks in a black-box manner. Yet, their inherent lack of interpretability remains a significant challenge, as these features are often opaque to human understanding. In this paper, we propose Non-negative Contrastive Learning (NCL), a renaissance of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) aimed at deriving interpretable features. The power of NCL lies in its enforcement of non-negativity constraints on features, reminiscent of NMF's capability to extract features that align closely with sample clusters. NCL not only aligns mathematically well with an NMF objective but also preserves NMF's interpretability attributes, resulting in a more sparse and disentangled representation compared to standard contrastive learning (CL). Theoretically, we establish guarantees on the identifiability and downstream generalization of NCL. Empirically, we show that these advantages enable NCL to outperform CL significantly on feature disentanglement, feature selection, as well as downstream classification tasks. At last, we show that NCL can be easily extended to other learning scenarios and benefit supervised learning as well. Code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/non_neg.</description>

      <title>UAlign: Pushing the Limit of Template-free Retrosynthesis Prediction with Unsupervised SMILES Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivation: Retrosynthesis planning poses a formidable challenge in the organic chemical industry. Single-step retrosynthesis prediction, a crucial step in the planning process, has witnessed a surge in interest in recent years due to advancements in AI for science. Various deep learning-based methods have been proposed for this task in recent years, incorporating diverse levels of additional chemical knowledge dependency.
  Results: This paper introduces UAlign, a template-free graph-to-sequence pipeline for retrosynthesis prediction. By combining graph neural networks and Transformers, our method can more effectively leverage the inherent graph structure of molecules. Based on the fact that the majority of molecule structures remain unchanged during a chemical reaction, we propose a simple yet effective SMILES alignment technique to facilitate the reuse of unchanged structures for reactant generation. Extensive experiments show that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art template-free and semi-template-based approaches. Importantly, our template-free method achieves effectiveness comparable to, or even surpasses, established powerful template-based methods.
  Scientific contribution: We present a novel graph-to-sequence template-free retrosynthesis prediction pipeline that overcomes the limitations of Transformer-based methods in molecular representation learning and insufficient utilization of chemical information. We propose an unsupervised learning mechanism for establishing product-atom correspondence with reactant SMILES tokens, achieving even better results than supervised SMILES alignment methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UAlign significantly outperforms state-of-the-art template-free methods and rivals or surpasses template-based approaches, with up to 5\% (top-5) and 5.4\% (top-10) increased accuracy over the strongest baseline.</description>

      <title>Towards Realistic Scene Generation with LiDAR Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in photo-realistic image synthesis, but their adaptation to LiDAR scene generation poses a substantial hurdle. This is primarily because DMs operating in the point space struggle to preserve the curve-like patterns and 3D geometry of LiDAR scenes, which consumes much of their representation power. In this paper, we propose LiDAR Diffusion Models (LiDMs) to generate LiDAR-realistic scenes from a latent space tailored to capture the realism of LiDAR scenes by incorporating geometric priors into the learning pipeline. Our method targets three major desiderata: pattern realism, geometry realism, and object realism. Specifically, we introduce curve-wise compression to simulate real-world LiDAR patterns, point-wise coordinate supervision to learn scene geometry, and patch-wise encoding for a full 3D object context. With these three core designs, our method achieves competitive performance on unconditional LiDAR generation in 64-beam scenario and state of the art on conditional LiDAR generation, while maintaining high efficiency compared to point-based DMs (up to 107$\times$ faster). Furthermore, by compressing LiDAR scenes into a latent space, we enable the controllability of DMs with various conditions such as semantic maps, camera views, and text prompts.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Optimization-based Task and Motion Planning: From Classical To Learning Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) integrates high-level task planning and low-level motion planning to equip robots with the autonomy to effectively reason over long-horizon, dynamic tasks. Optimization-based TAMP focuses on hybrid optimization approaches that define goal conditions via objective functions and are capable of handling open-ended goals, robotic dynamics, and physical interaction between the robot and the environment. Therefore, optimization-based TAMP is particularly suited to solve highly complex, contact-rich locomotion and manipulation problems. This survey provides a comprehensive review on optimization-based TAMP, covering (i) planning domain representations, including action description languages and temporal logic, (ii) individual solution strategies for components of TAMP, including AI planning and trajectory optimization (TO), and (iii) the dynamic interplay between logic-based task planning and model-based TO. A particular focus of this survey is to highlight the algorithm structures to efficiently solve TAMP, especially hierarchical and distributed approaches. Additionally, the survey emphasizes the synergy between the classical methods and contemporary learning-based innovations such as large language models. Furthermore, the future research directions for TAMP is discussed in this survey, highlighting both algorithmic and application-specific challenges.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Performance of Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to predict sentiment polarity with fine granularity. While Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are widely utilized for sentimental feature extraction, their naive application for syntactic feature extraction can compromise information preservation. This study introduces an innovative edge-enhanced GCN, named SentiSys, to navigate the syntactic graph while preserving intact feature information, leading to enhanced performance. Specifically,we first integrate a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network and a self-attention-based transformer. This combination facilitates effective text encoding, preventing the loss of information and predicting long dependency text. A bidirectional GCN (Bi-GCN) with message passing is then employed to encode relationships between entities. Additionally, unnecessary information is filtered out using an aspect-specific masking technique. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we conduct extensive evaluation experiments and ablation studies on four benchmark datasets. The results consistently demonstrate improved performance in aspect-based sentiment analysis when employing SentiSys. This approach successfully addresses the challenges associated with syntactic feature extraction, highlighting its potential for advancing sentiment analysis methodologies.</description>

      <title>Adapting LLMs for Efficient Context Processing through Soft Prompt Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has inaugurated a transformative epoch in natural language processing, fostering unprecedented proficiency in text generation, comprehension, and contextual scrutiny. Nevertheless, effectively handling extensive contexts, crucial for myriad applications, poses a formidable obstacle owing to the intrinsic constraints of the models' context window sizes and the computational burdens entailed by their operations. This investigation presents an innovative framework that strategically tailors LLMs for streamlined context processing by harnessing the synergies among natural language summarization, soft prompt compression, and augmented utility preservation mechanisms. Our methodology, dubbed SoftPromptComp, amalgamates natural language prompts extracted from summarization methodologies with dynamically generated soft prompts to forge a concise yet semantically robust depiction of protracted contexts. This depiction undergoes further refinement via a weighting mechanism optimizing information retention and utility for subsequent tasks. We substantiate that our framework markedly diminishes computational overhead and enhances LLMs' efficacy across various benchmarks, while upholding or even augmenting the caliber of the produced content. By amalgamating soft prompt compression with sophisticated summarization, SoftPromptComp confronts the dual challenges of managing lengthy contexts and ensuring model scalability. Our findings point towards a propitious trajectory for augmenting LLMs' applicability and efficiency, rendering them more versatile and pragmatic for real-world applications. This research enriches the ongoing discourse on optimizing language models, providing insights into the potency of soft prompts and summarization techniques as pivotal instruments for the forthcoming generation of NLP solutions.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology, AI-enabled image recognition has emerged as a potent tool for addressing challenges in traditional environmental monitoring. This study focuses on the detection of floating objects in river and lake environments, exploring an innovative approach based on deep learning. By intricately analyzing the technical pathways for detecting static and dynamic features and considering the characteristics of river and lake debris, a comprehensive image acquisition and processing workflow has been developed.

      <title>Large Language Model Can Continue Evolving From Mistakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance in various downstream tasks. However, they may still generate incorrect responses in certain scenarios due to the knowledge deficiencies and the flawed pre-training data. Continual Learning (CL) is a commonly used method to address this issue. Traditional CL is task-oriented, using novel or factually accurate data to retrain LLMs from scratch. However, this method requires more task-related training data and incurs expensive training costs. To address this challenge, we propose the Continue Evolving from Mistakes (CEM) method, inspired by the 'summarize mistakes' learning skill, to achieve iterative refinement of LLMs. Specifically, the incorrect responses of LLMs indicate knowledge deficiencies related to the questions. Therefore, we collect corpora with these knowledge from multiple data sources and follow it up with iterative supplementary training for continuous, targeted knowledge updating and supplementation. Meanwhile, we developed two strategies to construct supplementary training sets to enhance the LLM's understanding of the corpus and prevent catastrophic forgetting. We conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of this CL method. In the best case, our method resulted in a 17.00\% improvement in the accuracy of the LLM.</description>

      <title>Watermark-embedded Adversarial Examples for Copyright Protection against Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various image-generation tasks. However, there are growing concerns that DMs could be used to imitate unauthorized creations and thus raise copyright issues. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that embeds personal watermarks in the generation of adversarial examples. Such examples can force DMs to generate images with visible watermarks and prevent DMs from imitating unauthorized images. We construct a generator based on conditional adversarial networks and design three losses (adversarial loss, GAN loss, and perturbation loss) to generate adversarial examples that have subtle perturbation but can effectively attack DMs to prevent copyright violations. Training a generator for a personal watermark by our method only requires 5-10 samples within 2-3 minutes, and once the generator is trained, it can generate adversarial examples with that watermark significantly fast (0.2s per image). We conduct extensive experiments in various conditional image-generation scenarios. Compared to existing methods that generate images with chaotic textures, our method adds visible watermarks on the generated images, which is a more straightforward way to indicate copyright violations. We also observe that our adversarial examples exhibit good transferability across unknown generative models. Therefore, this work provides a simple yet powerful way to protect copyright from DM-based imitation.</description>

      <title>RanLayNet: A Dataset for Document Layout Detection used for Domain Adaptation and Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large ground-truth datasets and recent advances in deep learning techniques have been useful for layout detection. However, because of the restricted layout diversity of these datasets, training on them requires a sizable number of annotated instances, which is both expensive and time-consuming. As a result, differences between the source and target domains may significantly impact how well these models function. To solve this problem, domain adaptation approaches have been developed that use a small quantity of labeled data to adjust the model to the target domain. In this research, we introduced a synthetic document dataset called RanLayNet, enriched with automatically assigned labels denoting spatial positions, ranges, and types of layout elements. The primary aim of this endeavor is to develop a versatile dataset capable of training models with robustness and adaptability to diverse document formats. Through empirical experimentation, we demonstrate that a deep layout identification model trained on our dataset exhibits enhanced performance compared to a model trained solely on actual documents. Moreover, we conduct a comparative analysis by fine-tuning inference models using both PubLayNet and IIIT-AR-13K datasets on the Doclaynet dataset. Our findings emphasize that models enriched with our dataset are optimal for tasks such as achieving 0.398 and 0.588 mAP95 score in the scientific document domain for the TABLE class.</description>

      <title>Learning Symbolic Task Representation from a Human-Led Demonstration: A Memory to Store, Retrieve, Consolidate, and Forget Experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a symbolic learning framework inspired by cognitive-like memory functionalities (i.e., storing, retrieving, consolidating and forgetting) to generate task representations to support high-level task planning and knowledge bootstrapping. We address a scenario involving a non-expert human, who performs a single task demonstration, and a robot, which online learns structured knowledge to re-execute the task based on experiences, i.e., observations. We consider a one-shot learning process based on non-annotated data to store an intelligible representation of the task, which can be refined through interaction, e.g., via verbal or visual communication. Our general-purpose framework relies on fuzzy Description Logic, which has been used to extend the previously developed Scene Identification and Tagging algorithm. In this paper, we exploit such an algorithm to implement cognitive-like memory functionalities employing scores that rank memorised observations over time based on simple heuristics. Our main contribution is the formalisation of a framework that can be used to systematically investigate different heuristics for bootstrapping hierarchical knowledge representations based on robot observations. Through an illustrative assembly task scenario, the paper presents the performance of our framework to discuss its benefits and limitations.</description>

      <title>KI-GAN: Knowledge-Informed Generative Adversarial Networks for Enhanced Multi-Vehicle Trajectory Forecasting at Signalized Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable prediction of vehicle trajectories at signalized intersections is crucial to urban traffic management and autonomous driving systems. However, it presents unique challenges, due to the complex roadway layout at intersections, involvement of traffic signal controls, and interactions among different types of road users. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel model called Knowledge-Informed Generative Adversarial Network (KI-GAN), which integrates both traffic signal information and multi-vehicle interactions to predict vehicle trajectories accurately. Additionally, we propose a specialized attention pooling method that accounts for vehicle orientation and proximity at intersections. Based on the SinD dataset, our KI-GAN model is able to achieve an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 0.05 and a Final Displacement Error (FDE) of 0.12 for a 6-second observation and 6-second prediction cycle. When the prediction window is extended to 9 seconds, the ADE and FDE values are further reduced to 0.11 and 0.26, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed KI-GAN model in vehicle trajectory prediction under complex scenarios at signalized intersections, which represents a significant advancement in the target field.</description>

      <title>Feature Corrective Transfer Learning: End-to-End Solutions to Object Detection in Non-Ideal Visual Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant challenge in the field of object detection lies in the system's performance under non-ideal imaging conditions, such as rain, fog, low illumination, or raw Bayer images that lack ISP processing. Our study introduces "Feature Corrective Transfer Learning", a novel approach that leverages transfer learning and a bespoke loss function to facilitate the end-to-end detection of objects in these challenging scenarios without the need to convert non-ideal images into their RGB counterparts. In our methodology, we initially train a comprehensive model on a pristine RGB image dataset. Subsequently, non-ideal images are processed by comparing their feature maps against those from the initial ideal RGB model. This comparison employs the Extended Area Novel Structural Discrepancy Loss (EANSDL), a novel loss function designed to quantify similarities and integrate them into the detection loss. This approach refines the model's ability to perform object detection across varying conditions through direct feature map correction, encapsulating the essence of Feature Corrective Transfer Learning. Experimental validation on variants of the KITTI dataset demonstrates a significant improvement in mean Average Precision (mAP), resulting in a 3.8-8.1% relative enhancement in detection under non-ideal conditions compared to the baseline model, and a less marginal performance difference within 1.3% of the mAP@[0.5:0.95] achieved under ideal conditions by the standard Faster RCNN algorithm.</description>

      <title>Runtime Analysis of Evolutionary Diversity Optimization on the Multi-objective (LeadingOnes, TrailingZeros) Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diversity optimization is the class of optimization problems, in which we aim at finding a diverse set of good solutions. One of the frequently used approaches to solve such problems is to use evolutionary algorithms which evolve a desired diverse population. This approach is called evolutionary diversity optimization (EDO).
  In this paper, we analyse EDO on a 3-objective function LOTZ$_k$, which is a modification of the 2-objective benchmark function (LeadingOnes, TrailingZeros). We prove that the GSEMO computes a set of all Pareto-optimal solutions in $O(kn^3)$ expected iterations. We also analyze the runtime of the GSEMO$_D$ (a modification of the GSEMO for diversity optimization) until it finds a population with the best possible diversity for two different diversity measures, the total imbalance and the sorted imbalances vector. For the first measure we show that the GSEMO$_D$ optimizes it asymptotically faster than it finds a Pareto-optimal population, in $O(kn^2\log(n))$ expected iterations, and for the second measure we show an upper bound of $O(k^2n^3\log(n))$ expected iterations. We complement our theoretical analysis with an empirical study, which shows a very similar behavior for both diversity measures that is close to the theory predictions.</description>

      <title>De-DSI: Decentralised Differentiable Search Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces De-DSI, a novel framework that fuses large language models (LLMs) with genuine decentralization for information retrieval, particularly employing the differentiable search index (DSI) concept in a decentralized setting. Focused on efficiently connecting novel user queries with document identifiers without direct document access, De-DSI operates solely on query-docid pairs. To enhance scalability, an ensemble of DSI models is introduced, where the dataset is partitioned into smaller shards for individual model training. This approach not only maintains accuracy by reducing the number of data each model needs to handle but also facilitates scalability by aggregating outcomes from multiple models. This aggregation uses a beam search to identify top docids and applies a softmax function for score normalization, selecting documents with the highest scores for retrieval. The decentralized implementation demonstrates that retrieval success is comparable to centralized methods, with the added benefit of the possibility of distributing computational complexity across the network. This setup also allows for the retrieval of multimedia items through magnet links, eliminating the need for platforms or intermediaries.</description>
