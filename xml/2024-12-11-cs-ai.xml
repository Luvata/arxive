      <title>Revisiting Your Memory: Reconstruction of Affect-Contextualized Memory via EEG-guided Audiovisual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce RecallAffectiveMemory, a novel task designed to reconstruct autobiographical memories through audio-visual generation guided by affect extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. To support this pioneering task, we present the EEG-AffectiveMemory dataset, which encompasses textual descriptions, visuals, music, and EEG recordings collected during memory recall from nine participants. Furthermore, we propose RYM (Recall Your Memory), a three-stage framework for generating synchronized audio-visual contents while maintaining dynamic personal memory affect trajectories. Experimental results indicate that our method can faithfully reconstruct affect-contextualized audio-visual memory across all subjects, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with participants reporting strong affective concordance between their recalled memories and the generated content. Our approaches advance affect decoding research and its practical applications in personalized media creation via neural-based affect comprehension.</description>

      <title>DRL4AOI: A DRL Framework for Semantic-aware AOI Segmentation in Location-Based Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Location-Based Services (LBS), such as food delivery, a fundamental task is segmenting Areas of Interest (AOIs), aiming at partitioning the urban geographical spaces into non-overlapping regions. Traditional AOI segmentation algorithms primarily rely on road networks to partition urban areas. While promising in modeling the geo-semantics, road network-based models overlooked the service-semantic goals (e.g., workload equality) in LBS service. In this paper, we point out that the AOI segmentation problem can be naturally formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which gradually chooses a nearby AOI for each grid in the current AOI's border. Based on the MDP, we present the first attempt to generalize Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for AOI segmentation, leading to a novel DRL-based framework called DRL4AOI. The DRL4AOI framework introduces different service-semantic goals in a flexible way by treating them as rewards that guide the AOI generation. To evaluate the effectiveness of DRL4AOI, we develop and release an AOI segmentation system. We also present a representative implementation of DRL4AOI - TrajRL4AOI - for AOI segmentation in the logistics service. It introduces a Double Deep Q-learning Network (DDQN) to gradually optimize the AOI generation for two specific semantic goals: i) trajectory modularity, i.e., maximize tightness of the trajectory connections within an AOI and the sparsity of connections between AOIs, ii) matchness with the road network, i.e., maximizing the matchness between AOIs and the road network. Quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method. The code and system is publicly available at https://github.com/Kogler7/AoiOpt.</description>

      <title>A Compositional Atlas for Algebraic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circuits based on sum-product structure have become a ubiquitous representation to compactly encode knowledge, from Boolean functions to probability distributions. By imposing constraints on the structure of such circuits, certain inference queries become tractable, such as model counting and most probable configuration. Recent works have explored analyzing probabilistic and causal inference queries as compositions of basic operators to derive tractability conditions. In this paper, we take an algebraic perspective for compositional inference, and show that a large class of queries - including marginal MAP, probabilistic answer set programming inference, and causal backdoor adjustment - correspond to a combination of basic operators over semirings: aggregation, product, and elementwise mapping. Using this framework, we uncover simple and general sufficient conditions for tractable composition of these operators, in terms of circuit properties (e.g., marginal determinism, compatibility) and conditions on the elementwise mappings. Applying our analysis, we derive novel tractability conditions for many such compositional queries. Our results unify tractability conditions for existing problems on circuits, while providing a blueprint for analysing novel compositional inference queries.</description>

      <title>More than Marketing? On the Information Value of AI Benchmarks for Practitioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public AI benchmark results are widely broadcast by model developers as indicators of model quality within a growing and competitive market. However, these advertised scores do not necessarily reflect the traits of interest to those who will ultimately apply AI models. In this paper, we seek to understand if and how AI benchmarks are used to inform decision-making. Based on the analyses of interviews with 19 individuals who have used, or decided against using, benchmarks in their day-to-day work, we find that across these settings, participants use benchmarks as a signal of relative performance difference between models. However, whether this signal was considered a definitive sign of model superiority, sufficient for downstream decisions, varied. In academia, public benchmarks were generally viewed as suitable measures for capturing research progress. By contrast, in both product and policy, benchmarks -- even those developed internally for specific tasks -- were often found to be inadequate for informing substantive decisions. Of the benchmarks deemed unsatisfactory, respondents reported that their goals were neither well-defined nor reflective of real-world use. Based on the study results, we conclude that effective benchmarks should provide meaningful, real-world evaluations, incorporate domain expertise, and maintain transparency in scope and goals. They must capture diverse, task-relevant capabilities, be challenging enough to avoid quick saturation, and account for trade-offs in model performance rather than relying on a single score. Additionally, proprietary data collection and contamination prevention are critical for producing reliable and actionable results. By adhering to these criteria, benchmarks can move beyond mere marketing tricks into robust evaluative frameworks.</description>

      <title>AI Planning: A Primer and Survey (Preliminary Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated decision-making is a fundamental topic that spans multiple sub-disciplines in AI: reinforcement learning (RL), AI planning (AP), foundation models, and operations research, among others. Despite recent efforts to ``bridge the gaps'' between these communities, there remain many insights that have not yet transcended the boundaries. Our goal in this paper is to provide a brief and non-exhaustive primer on ideas well-known in AP, but less so in other sub-disciplines. We do so by introducing the classical AP problem and representation, and extensions that handle uncertainty and time through the Markov Decision Process formalism. Next, we survey state-of-the-art techniques and ideas for solving AP problems, focusing on their ability to exploit problem structure. Lastly, we cover subfields within AP for learning structure from unstructured inputs and learning to generalise to unseen scenarios and situations.</description>

      <title>Towards Learning to Reason: Comparing LLMs with Neuro-Symbolic on Arithmetic Relations in Abstract Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work compares large language models (LLMs) and neuro-symbolic approaches in solving Raven's progressive matrices (RPM), a visual abstract reasoning test that involves the understanding of mathematical rules such as progression or arithmetic addition. Providing the visual attributes directly as textual prompts, which assumes an oracle visual perception module, allows us to measure the model's abstract reasoning capability in isolation. Despite providing such compositionally structured representations from the oracle visual perception and advanced prompting techniques, both GPT-4 and Llama-3 70B cannot achieve perfect accuracy on the center constellation of the I-RAVEN dataset. Our analysis reveals that the root cause lies in the LLM's weakness in understanding and executing arithmetic rules. As a potential remedy, we analyze the Abductive Rule Learner with Context-awareness (ARLC), a neuro-symbolic approach that learns to reason with vector-symbolic architectures (VSAs). Here, concepts are represented with distributed vectors s.t. dot products between encoded vectors define a similarity kernel, and simple element-wise operations on the vectors perform addition/subtraction on the encoded values. We find that ARLC achieves almost perfect accuracy on the center constellation of I-RAVEN, demonstrating a high fidelity in arithmetic rules. To stress the length generalization capabilities of the models, we extend the RPM tests to larger matrices (3x10 instead of typical 3x3) and larger dynamic ranges of the attribute values (from 10 up to 1000). We find that the LLM's accuracy of solving arithmetic rules drops to sub-10%, especially as the dynamic range expands, while ARLC can maintain a high accuracy due to emulating symbolic computations on top of properly distributed representations.

      <title>From Flexibility to Manipulation: The Slippery Slope of XAI Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of ground truth explanation labels is a fundamental challenge for quantitative evaluation in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). This challenge becomes especially problematic when evaluation methods have numerous hyperparameters that must be specified by the user, as there is no ground truth to determine an optimal hyperparameter selection. It is typically not feasible to do an exhaustive search of hyperparameters so researchers typically make a normative choice based on similar studies in the literature, which provides great flexibility for the user. In this work, we illustrate how this flexibility can be exploited to manipulate the evaluation outcome. We frame this manipulation as an adversarial attack on the evaluation where seemingly innocent changes in hyperparameter setting significantly influence the evaluation outcome. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our manipulation across several datasets with large changes in evaluation outcomes across several explanation methods and models. Lastly, we propose a mitigation strategy based on ranking across hyperparameters that aims to provide robustness towards such manipulation. This work highlights the difficulty of conducting reliable XAI evaluation and emphasizes the importance of a holistic and transparent approach to evaluation in XAI.</description>

      <title>RL Zero: Zero-Shot Language to Behaviors without any Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rewards remain an uninterpretable way to specify tasks for Reinforcement Learning, as humans are often unable to predict the optimal behavior of any given reward function, leading to poor reward design and reward hacking. Language presents an appealing way to communicate intent to agents and bypass reward design, but prior efforts to do so have been limited by costly and unscalable labeling efforts. In this work, we propose a method for a completely unsupervised alternative to grounding language instructions in a zero-shot manner to obtain policies. We present a solution that takes the form of imagine, project, and imitate: The agent imagines the observation sequence corresponding to the language description of a task, projects the imagined sequence to our target domain, and grounds it to a policy. Video-language models allow us to imagine task descriptions that leverage knowledge of tasks learned from internet-scale video-text mappings. The challenge remains to ground these generations to a policy. In this work, we show that we can achieve a zero-shot language-to-behavior policy by first grounding the imagined sequences in real observations of an unsupervised RL agent and using a closed-form solution to imitation learning that allows the RL agent to mimic the grounded observations. Our method, RLZero, is the first to our knowledge to show zero-shot language to behavior generation abilities without any supervision on a variety of tasks on simulated domains. We further show that RLZero can also generate policies zero-shot from cross-embodied videos such as those scraped from YouTube.</description>

      <title>A Collaborative Multi-Agent Approach to Retrieval-Augmented Generation Across Diverse Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external, domain-specific data into the generative process. While LLMs are highly capable, they often rely on static, pre-trained datasets, limiting their ability to integrate dynamic or private data. Traditional RAG systems typically use a single-agent architecture to handle query generation, data retrieval, and response synthesis. However, this approach becomes inefficient when dealing with diverse data sources, such as relational databases, document stores, and graph databases, often leading to performance bottlenecks and reduced accuracy. This paper proposes a multi-agent RAG system to address these limitations. Specialized agents, each optimized for a specific data source, handle query generation for relational, NoSQL, and document-based systems. These agents collaborate within a modular framework, with query execution delegated to an environment designed for compatibility across various database types. This distributed approach enhances query efficiency, reduces token overhead, and improves response accuracy by ensuring that each agent focuses on its specialized task. The proposed system is scalable and adaptable, making it ideal for generative AI workflows that require integration with diverse, dynamic, or private data sources. By leveraging specialized agents and a modular execution environment, the system provides an efficient and robust solution for handling complex, heterogeneous data environments in generative AI applications.</description>

      <title>The AI Double Standard: Humans Judge All AIs for the Actions of One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots and other artificial intelligence (AI) systems are widely perceived as moral agents responsible for their actions. As AI proliferates, these perceptions may become entangled via the moral spillover of attitudes towards one AI to attitudes towards other AIs. We tested how the seemingly harmful and immoral actions of an AI or human agent spill over to attitudes towards other AIs or humans in two preregistered experiments. In Study 1 (N = 720), we established the moral spillover effect in human-AI interaction by showing that immoral actions increased attributions of negative moral agency (i.e., acting immorally) and decreased attributions of positive moral agency (i.e., acting morally) and moral patiency (i.e., deserving moral concern) to both the agent (a chatbot or human assistant) and the group to which they belong (all chatbot or human assistants). There was no significant difference in the spillover effects between the AI and human contexts. In Study 2 (N = 684), we tested whether spillover persisted when the agent was individuated with a name and described as an AI or human, rather than specifically as a chatbot or personal assistant. We found that spillover persisted in the AI context but not in the human context, possibly because AIs were perceived as more homogeneous due to their outgroup status relative to humans. This asymmetry suggests a double standard whereby AIs are judged more harshly than humans when one agent morally transgresses. With the proliferation of diverse, autonomous AI systems, HCI research and design should account for the fact that experiences with one AI could easily generalize to perceptions of all AIs and negative HCI outcomes, such as reduced trust.</description>

      <title>Query-Efficient Planning with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planning in complex environments requires an agent to efficiently query a world model to find a feasible sequence of actions from start to goal. Recent work has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs), with their rich prior knowledge and reasoning capabilities, can potentially help with planning by searching over promising states and adapting to feedback from the world. In this paper, we propose and study two fundamentally competing frameworks that leverage LLMs for query-efficient planning. The first uses LLMs as a heuristic within a search-based planner to select promising nodes to expand and propose promising actions. The second uses LLMs as a generative planner to propose an entire sequence of actions from start to goal, query a world model, and adapt based on feedback. We show that while both approaches improve upon comparable baselines, using an LLM as a generative planner results in significantly fewer interactions. Our key finding is that the LLM as a planner can more rapidly adapt its planning strategies based on immediate feedback than LLM as a heuristic. We present evaluations and ablations on Robotouille and PDDL planning benchmarks and discuss connections to existing theory on query-efficient planning algorithms.

      <title>ACQ: A Unified Framework for Automated Programmatic Creativity in Online Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In online advertising, the demand-side platform (a.k.a. DSP) enables advertisers to create different ad creatives for real-time bidding. Intuitively, advertisers tend to create more ad creatives for a single photo to increase the probability of participating in bidding, further enhancing their ad cost. From the perspective of DSP, the following are two overlooked issues. On the one hand, the number of ad creatives cannot grow indefinitely. On the other hand, the marginal effects of ad cost diminish as the number of ad creatives increases. To this end, this paper proposes a two-stage framework named Automated Creatives Quota (ACQ) to achieve the automatic creation and deactivation of ad creatives. ACQ dynamically allocates the creative quota across multiple advertisers to maximize the revenue of the ad platform. ACQ comprises two components: a prediction module to estimate the cost of a photo under different numbers of ad creatives, and an allocation module to decide the quota for photos considering their estimated costs in the prediction module. Specifically, in the prediction module, we develop a multi-task learning model based on an unbalanced binary tree to effectively mitigate the target variable imbalance problem. In the allocation module, we formulate the quota allocation problem as a multiple-choice knapsack problem (MCKP) and develop an efficient solver to solve such large-scale problems involving tens of millions of ads. We performed extensive offline and online experiments to validate the superiority of our proposed framework, which increased cost by 9.34%.</description>

      <title>LLMs as Debate Partners: Utilizing Genetic Algorithms and Adversarial Search for Adaptive Arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces DebateBrawl, an innovative AI-powered debate platform that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), Genetic Algorithms (GA), and Adversarial Search (AS) to create an adaptive and engaging debating experience. DebateBrawl addresses the limitations of traditional LLMs in strategic planning by incorporating evolutionary optimization and game-theoretic techniques. The system demonstrates remarkable performance in generating coherent, contextually relevant arguments while adapting its strategy in real-time. Experimental results involving 23 debates show balanced outcomes between AI and human participants, with the AI system achieving an average score of 2.72 compared to the human average of 2.67 out of 10. User feedback indicates significant improvements in debating skills and a highly satisfactory learning experience, with 85% of users reporting improved debating abilities and 78% finding the AI opponent appropriately challenging. The system's ability to maintain high factual accuracy (92% compared to 78% in human-only debates) while generating diverse arguments addresses critical concerns in AI-assisted discourse. DebateBrawl not only serves as an effective educational tool but also contributes to the broader goal of improving public discourse through AI-assisted argumentation. The paper discusses the ethical implications of AI in persuasive contexts and outlines the measures implemented to ensure responsible development and deployment of the system, including robust fact-checking mechanisms and transparency in decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>Towards High-Level Modelling in Automated Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planning is a fundamental activity, arising frequently in many contexts, from daily tasks to industrial processes. The planning task consists of selecting a sequence of actions to achieve a specified goal from specified initial conditions. The Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) is the leading language used in the field of automated planning to model planning problems. Previous work has highlighted the limitations of PDDL, particularly in terms of its expressivity. Our interest lies in facilitating the handling of complex problems and enhancing the overall capability of automated planning systems. Unified-Planning is a Python library offering high-level API to specify planning problems and to invoke automated planners. In this paper, we present an extension of the UP library aimed at enhancing its expressivity for high-level problem modelling. In particular, we have added an array type, an expression to count booleans, and the allowance for integer parameters in actions. We show how these facilities enable natural high-level models of three classical planning problems.</description>

      <title>GameArena: Evaluating LLM Reasoning through Live Computer Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) is challenging. Existing benchmarks often depend on static datasets, which are vulnerable to data contamination and may get saturated over time, or on binary live human feedback that conflates reasoning with other abilities. As the most prominent dynamic benchmark, Chatbot Arena evaluates open-ended questions in real-world settings, but lacks the granularity in assessing specific reasoning capabilities. We introduce GameArena, a dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities through interactive gameplay with humans. GameArena consists of three games designed to test specific reasoning capabilities (e.g., deductive and inductive reasoning), while keeping participants entertained and engaged. We analyze the gaming data retrospectively to uncover the underlying reasoning processes of LLMs and measure their fine-grained reasoning capabilities. We collect over 2000 game sessions and provide detailed assessments of various reasoning capabilities for five state-of-the-art LLMs. Our user study with 100 participants suggests that GameArena improves user engagement compared to Chatbot Arena. For the first time, GameArena enables the collection of step-by-step LLM reasoning data in the wild.</description>

      <title>Simulating Human-like Daily Activities with Desire-driven Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing task-oriented AI agents often depend on explicit instructions or external rewards, limiting their ability to be driven by intrinsic motivations like humans. In this paper, we present a desire-driven autonomy framework to guide a Large Language Model-based (LLM-based) agent to simulate human-like daily activities. In contrast to previous agents, our Desire-driven Autonomous Agent (D2A) operates on the principle of intrinsic desire, allowing it to propose and select tasks that fulfill its motivational framework autonomously. Inspired by the Theory of Needs, the motivational framework incorporates an understanding of human-like desires, such as the need for social interaction, personal fulfillment, and self-care. Utilizing a desire-driven task generation mechanism, the agent evaluates its current state and takes a sequence of activities aligned with its intrinsic motivations. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our Desire-driven Autonomous Agent (D2A) generates coherent, contextually relevant daily activities while exhibiting variability and adaptability similar to human behavior. A comparative analysis with other LLM-based frameworks demonstrates that our approach significantly enhances the rationality of the simulated activities.</description>

      <title>The Fusion of Large Language Models and Formal Methods for Trustworthy AI Agents: A Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative AI paradigm, profoundly influencing daily life through their exceptional language understanding and contextual generation capabilities. Despite their remarkable performance, LLMs face a critical challenge: the propensity to produce unreliable outputs due to the inherent limitations of their learning-based nature. Formal methods (FMs), on the other hand, are a well-established computation paradigm that provides mathematically rigorous techniques for modeling, specifying, and verifying the correctness of systems. FMs have been extensively applied in mission-critical software engineering, embedded systems, and cybersecurity. However, the primary challenge impeding the deployment of FMs in real-world settings lies in their steep learning curves, the absence of user-friendly interfaces, and issues with efficiency and adaptability.
  This position paper outlines a roadmap for advancing the next generation of trustworthy AI systems by leveraging the mutual enhancement of LLMs and FMs. First, we illustrate how FMs, including reasoning and certification techniques, can help LLMs generate more reliable and formally certified outputs. Subsequently, we highlight how the advanced learning capabilities and adaptability of LLMs can significantly enhance the usability, efficiency, and scalability of existing FM tools. Finally, we show that unifying these two computation paradigms -- integrating the flexibility and intelligence of LLMs with the rigorous reasoning abilities of FMs -- has transformative potential for the development of trustworthy AI software systems. We acknowledge that this integration has the potential to enhance both the trustworthiness and efficiency of software engineering practices while fostering the development of intelligent FM tools capable of addressing complex yet real-world challenges.</description>

      <title>ProcessBench: Identifying Process Errors in Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As language models regularly make mistakes when solving math problems, automated identification of errors in the reasoning process becomes increasingly significant for their scalable oversight. In this paper, we introduce ProcessBench for measuring the ability to identify erroneous steps in mathematical reasoning. It consists of 3,400 test cases, primarily focused on competition- and Olympiad-level math problems. Each test case contains a step-by-step solution with error location annotated by human experts. Models are required to identify the earliest step that contains an error, or conclude that all steps are correct. We conduct extensive evaluation on ProcessBench, involving two types of models: process reward models (PRMs) and critic models, where for the latter we prompt general language models to critique each solution step by step. We draw two main observations: (1) Existing PRMs typically fail to generalize to more challenging math problems beyond GSM8K and MATH. They underperform both critic models (i.e., prompted general language models) and our own trained PRM that is straightforwardly fine-tuned on the PRM800K dataset. (2) The best open-source model, QwQ-32B-Preview, has demonstrated the critique capability competitive with the proprietary model GPT-4o, despite that it still lags behind the reasoning-specialized o1-mini. We hope ProcessBench can foster future research in reasoning process assessment, paving the way toward scalable oversight of language models.</description>

      <title>Toward LLM-Agent-Based Modeling of Transportation Systems: A Conceptual Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In transportation system demand modeling and simulation, agent-based models and microsimulations are current state-of-the-art approaches. However, existing agent-based models still have some limitations on behavioral realism and resource demand that limit their applicability. In this study, leveraging the emerging technology of large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents, we propose a general LLM-agent-based modeling framework for transportation systems. We argue that LLM agents not only possess the essential capabilities to function as agents but also offer promising solutions to overcome some limitations of existing agent-based models. Our conceptual framework design closely replicates the decision-making and interaction processes and traits of human travelers within transportation networks, and we demonstrate that the proposed systems can meet critical behavioral criteria for decision-making and learning behaviors using related studies and a demonstrative example of LLM agents' learning and adjustment in the bottleneck setting. Although further refinement of the LLM-agent-based modeling framework is necessary, we believe that this approach has the potential to improve transportation system modeling and simulation.</description>

      <title>Proactive Agents for Multi-Turn Text-to-Image Generation Under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User prompts for generative AI models are often underspecified, leading to sub-optimal responses. This problem is particularly evident in text-to-image (T2I) generation, where users commonly struggle to articulate their precise intent. This disconnect between the user's vision and the model's interpretation often forces users to painstakingly and repeatedly refine their prompts. To address this, we propose a design for proactive T2I agents equipped with an interface to (1) actively ask clarification questions when uncertain, and (2) present their understanding of user intent as an understandable belief graph that a user can edit. We build simple prototypes for such agents and verify their effectiveness through both human studies and automated evaluation. We observed that at least 90% of human subjects found these agents and their belief graphs helpful for their T2I workflow. Moreover, we develop a scalable automated evaluation approach using two agents, one with a ground truth image and the other tries to ask as few questions as possible to align with the ground truth. On DesignBench, a benchmark we created for artists and designers, the COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014), and ImageInWords (Garg et al., 2024), we observed that these T2I agents were able to ask informative questions and elicit crucial information to achieve successful alignment with at least 2 times higher VQAScore (Lin et al., 2024) than the standard single-turn T2I generation.

      <title>On the Replicability and Reproducibility of Deep Learning in Software Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2006.14244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) techniques have gained significant popularity among software engineering (SE) researchers in recent years. This is because they can often solve many SE challenges without enormous manual feature engineering effort and complex domain knowledge. Although many DL studies have reported substantial advantages over other state-of-the-art models on effectiveness, they often ignore two factors: (1) replicability - whether the reported experimental result can be approximately reproduced in high probability with the same DL model and the same data; and (2) reproducibility - whether one reported experimental findings can be reproduced by new experiments with the same experimental protocol and DL model, but different sampled real-world data. Unlike traditional machine learning (ML) models, DL studies commonly overlook these two factors and declare them as minor threats or leave them for future work. This is mainly due to high model complexity with many manually set parameters and the time-consuming optimization process. In this study, we conducted a literature review on 93 DL studies recently published in twenty SE journals or conferences. Our statistics show the urgency of investigating these two factors in SE. Moreover, we re-ran four representative DL models in SE. Experimental results show the importance of replicability and reproducibility, where the reported performance of a DL model could not be replicated for an unstable optimization process. Reproducibility could be substantially compromised if the model training is not convergent, or if performance is sensitive to the size of vocabulary and testing data. It is therefore urgent for the SE community to provide a long-lasting link to a replication package, enhance DL-based solution stability and convergence, and avoid performance sensitivity on different sampled data.</description>

      <title>Security Threats in Agentic AI System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research paper explores the privacy and security threats posed to an Agentic AI system with direct access to database systems. Such access introduces significant risks, including unauthorized retrieval of sensitive information, potential exploitation of system vulnerabilities, and misuse of personal or confidential data. The complexity of AI systems combined with their ability to process and analyze large volumes of data increases the chances of data leaks or breaches, which could occur unintentionally or through adversarial manipulation. Furthermore, as AI agents evolve with greater autonomy, their capacity to bypass or exploit security measures becomes a growing concern, heightening the need to address these critical vulnerabilities in agentic systems.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models to Democratize Access to Costly Financial Datasets for Academic Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unequal access to costly datasets essential for empirical research has long hindered researchers from disadvantaged institutions, limiting their ability to contribute to their fields and advance their careers. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to democratize data access by automating data collection from unstructured sources. We develop and evaluate a novel methodology using GPT-4o-mini within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to collect data from corporate disclosures. Our approach achieves human-level accuracy in collecting CEO pay ratios from approximately 10,000 proxy statements and Critical Audit Matters (CAMs) from more than 12,000 10-K filings, with LLM processing times of 9 and 40 minutes respectively, each at a cost under $10. This stands in stark contrast to the hundreds of hours needed for manual collection or the thousands of dollars required for commercial database subscriptions. To foster a more inclusive research community by empowering researchers with limited resources to explore new avenues of inquiry, we share our methodology and the resulting datasets.</description>

      <title>Specifications: The missing link to making the development of LLM systems an engineering discipline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the significant strides made by generative AI in just a few short years, its future progress is constrained by the challenge of building modular and robust systems. This capability has been a cornerstone of past technological revolutions, which relied on combining components to create increasingly sophisticated and reliable systems. Cars, airplanes, computers, and software consist of components-such as engines, wheels, CPUs, and libraries-that can be assembled, debugged, and replaced. A key tool for building such reliable and modular systems is specification: the precise description of the expected behavior, inputs, and outputs of each component. However, the generality of LLMs and the inherent ambiguity of natural language make defining specifications for LLM-based components (e.g., agents) both a challenging and urgent problem. In this paper, we discuss the progress the field has made so far-through advances like structured outputs, process supervision, and test-time compute-and outline several future directions for research to enable the development of modular and reliable LLM-based systems through improved specifications.</description>

      <title>DocEDA: Automated Extraction and Design of Analog Circuits from Documents with Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate extraction of electrical parameters from circuit datasheets and design documents is critical for accelerating circuit design in Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Traditional workflows often rely on engineers manually searching and extracting these parameters, which is time-consuming, and prone to human error. To address these challenges, we introduce DocEDA, an automated system that leverages advanced computer vision techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract electrical parameters seamlessly from documents. The layout analysis model specifically designed for datasheet is proposed to classify documents into circuit-related parts. Utilizing the inherent Chain-of-Thought reasoning capabilities of LLMs, DocEDA automates the extraction of electronic component parameters from documents. For circuit diagrams parsing, an improved GAM-YOLO model is hybrid with topology identification to transform diagrams into circuit netlists. Then, a space mapping enhanced optimization framework is evoked for optimization the layout in the document. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that DocEDA significantly enhances the efficiency of processing circuit design documents and the accuracy of electrical parameter extraction. It exhibits adaptability to various circuit design scenarios and document formats, offering a novel solution for EDA with the potential to transform traditional methodologies.</description>

      <title>DRC-Coder: Automated DRC Checker Code Generation Using LLM Autonomous Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the advanced technology nodes, the integrated design rule checker (DRC) is often utilized in place and route tools for fast optimization loops for power-performance-area. Implementing integrated DRC checkers to meet the standard of commercial DRC tools demands extensive human expertise to interpret foundry specifications, analyze layouts, and debug code iteratively. However, this labor-intensive process, requiring to be repeated by every update of technology nodes, prolongs the turnaround time of designing circuits. In this paper, we present DRC-Coder, a multi-agent framework with vision capabilities for automated DRC code generation. By incorporating vision language models and large language models (LLM), DRC-Coder can effectively process textual, visual, and layout information to perform rule interpretation and coding by two specialized LLMs. We also design an auto-evaluation function for LLMs to enable DRC code debugging. Experimental results show that targeting on a sub-3nm technology node for a state-of-the-art standard cell layout tool, DRC-Coder achieves perfect F1 score 1.000 in generating DRC codes for meeting the standard of a commercial DRC tool, highly outperforming standard prompting techniques (F1=0.631). DRC-Coder can generate code for each design rule within four minutes on average, which significantly accelerates technology advancement and reduces engineering costs.</description>

      <title>LaNMP: A Language-Conditioned Mobile Manipulation Benchmark for Autonomous Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As robots that follow natural language become more capable and prevalent, we need a benchmark to holistically develop and evaluate their ability to solve long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks in large, diverse environments. To tackle this challenge, robots must use visual and language understanding, navigation, and manipulation capabilities. Existing datasets do not integrate all these aspects, restricting their efficacy as benchmarks. To address this gap, we present the Language, Navigation, Manipulation, Perception (LaNMP, pronounced Lamp) dataset and demonstrate the benefits of integrating these four capabilities and various modalities. LaNMP comprises 574 trajectories across eight simulated and real-world environments for long-horizon room-to-room pick-and-place tasks specified by natural language. Every trajectory consists of over 20 attributes, including RGB-D images, segmentations, and the poses of the robot body, end-effector, and grasped objects. We fine-tuned and tested two models in simulation, and evaluated a third on a physical robot, to demonstrate the benchmark's applicability in development and evaluation, as well as making models more sample efficient. The models performed suboptimally compared to humans; however, showed promise in increasing model sample efficiency, indicating significant room for developing more sample efficient multimodal mobile manipulation models using our benchmark.</description>

      <title>$\rho$-NeRF: Leveraging Attenuation Priors in Neural Radiance Field for 3D Computed Tomography Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces $\rho$-NeRF, a self-supervised approach that sets a new standard in novel view synthesis (NVS) and computed tomography (CT) reconstruction by modeling a continuous volumetric radiance field enriched with physics-based attenuation priors. The $\rho$-NeRF represents a three-dimensional (3D) volume through a fully-connected neural network that takes a single continuous four-dimensional (4D) coordinate, spatial location $(x, y, z)$ and an initialized attenuation value ($\rho$), and outputs the attenuation coefficient at that position. By querying these 4D coordinates along X-ray paths, the classic forward projection technique is applied to integrate attenuation data across the 3D space. By matching and refining pre-initialized attenuation values derived from traditional reconstruction algorithms like Feldkamp-Davis-Kress algorithm (FDK) or conjugate gradient least squares (CGLS), the enriched schema delivers superior fidelity in both projection synthesis and image recognition.</description>

      <title>IMPACT:InMemory ComPuting Architecture Based on Y-FlAsh Technology for Coalesced Tsetlin Machine Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for processing large volumes of data for machine learning models has pushed data bandwidth requirements beyond the capability of traditional von Neumann architecture. In-memory computing (IMC) has recently emerged as a promising solution to address this gap by enabling distributed data storage and processing at the micro-architectural level, significantly reducing both latency and energy. In this paper, we present the IMPACT: InMemory ComPuting Architecture Based on Y-FlAsh Technology for Coalesced Tsetlin Machine Inference, underpinned on a cutting-edge memory device, Y-Flash, fabricated on a 180 nm CMOS process. Y-Flash devices have recently been demonstrated for digital and analog memory applications, offering high yield, non-volatility, and low power consumption. The IMPACT leverages the Y-Flash array to implement the inference of a novel machine learning algorithm: coalesced Tsetlin machine (CoTM) based on propositional logic. CoTM utilizes Tsetlin automata (TA) to create Boolean feature selections stochastically across parallel clauses. The IMPACT is organized into two computational crossbars for storing the TA and weights. Through validation on the MNIST dataset, IMPACT achieved 96.3% accuracy. The IMPACT demonstrated improvements in energy efficiency, e.g., 2.23X over CNN-based ReRAM, 2.46X over Neuromorphic using NOR-Flash, and 2.06X over DNN-based PCM, suited for modern ML inference applications.</description>

      <title>Mapping The Layers of The Ocean Floor With a Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mapping of ocean floor layers is a current challenge for the oil industry. Existing solution methods involve mapping through seismic methods and wave inversion, which are complex and computationally expensive. The introduction of artificial neural networks, specifically UNet, to predict velocity models based on seismic shots reflected from the ocean floor shows promise for optimising this process. In this study, two neural network architectures are validated for velocity model inversion and compared in terms of stability metrics such as loss function and similarity coefficient, as well as the differences between predicted and actual models. Indeed, neural networks prove promising as a solution to this challenge, achieving S{\o}rensen-Dice coefficient values above 70%.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning and Hybrid Approaches for Dynamic Scene Analysis, Object Detection and Motion Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This project aims to develop a robust video surveillance system, which can segment videos into smaller clips based on the detection of activities. It uses CCTV footage, for example, to record only major events-like the appearance of a person or a thief-so that storage is optimized and digital searches are easier. It utilizes the latest techniques in object detection and tracking, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like YOLO, SSD, and Faster R-CNN, as well as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), to achieve high accuracy in detection and capture temporal dependencies. The approach incorporates adaptive background modeling through Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and optical flow methods like Lucas-Kanade to detect motions. Multi-scale and contextual analysis are used to improve detection across different object sizes and environments. A hybrid motion segmentation strategy combines statistical and deep learning models to manage complex movements, while optimizations for real-time processing ensure efficient computation. Tracking methods, such as Kalman Filters and Siamese networks, are employed to maintain smooth tracking even in cases of occlusion. Detection is improved on various-sized objects for multiple scenarios by multi-scale and contextual analysis. Results demonstrate high precision and recall in detecting and tracking objects, with significant improvements in processing times and accuracy due to real-time optimizations and illumination-invariant features. The impact of this research lies in its potential to transform video surveillance, reducing storage requirements and enhancing security through reliable and efficient object detection and tracking.</description>

      <title>Generative Model-Based Fusion for Improved Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation of Infrared Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) imaging is commonly used in various scenarios, including autonomous driving, fire safety and defense applications. Thus, semantic segmentation of such images is of great interest. However, this task faces several challenges, including data scarcity, differing contrast and input channel number compared to natural images, and emergence of classes not represented in databases in certain scenarios, such as defense applications. Few-shot segmentation (FSS) provides a framework to overcome these issues by segmenting query images using a few labeled support samples. However, existing FSS models for IR images require paired visible RGB images, which is a major limitation since acquiring such paired data is difficult or impossible in some applications. In this work, we develop new strategies for FSS of IR images by using generative modeling and fusion techniques. To this end, we propose to synthesize auxiliary data to provide additional channel information to complement the limited contrast in the IR images, as well as IR data synthesis for data augmentation. Here, the former helps the FSS model to better capture the relationship between the support and query sets, while the latter addresses the issue of data scarcity. Finally, to further improve the former aspect, we propose a novel fusion ensemble module for integrating the two different modalities. Our methods are evaluated on different IR datasets, and improve upon the state-of-the-art (SOTA) FSS models.</description>

      <title>Multi-Party Supervised Fine-tuning of Language Models for Multi-Party Dialogue Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) are usually fine-tuned to participate in dyadic or two-party dialogues, which can not adapt well to multi-party dialogues (MPD), which hinders their applications in such scenarios including multi-personal meetings, discussions and daily communication. Previous LLM-based researches mainly focus on the multi-agent framework, while their base LLMs are still pairwisely fine-tuned. In this work, we design a multi-party fine-tuning framework (MuPaS) for LLMs on the multi-party dialogue datasets, and prove such a straightforward framework can let the LLM align with the multi-party conversation style efficiently and effectively. We also design two training strategies which can convert MuPaS into the MPD simulator. Substantial experiments show that MuPaS can achieve state-of-the-art multi-party response, higher accuracy of the-next-speaker prediction, higher human and automatic evaluated utterance qualities, and can even generate reasonably with out-of-distribution scene, topic and role descriptions. The MuPaS framework bridges the LLM training with more complicated multi-party applications, such as conversation generation, virtual rehearsal or meta-universe.</description>

      <title>Towards Predicting the Success of Transfer-based Attacks by Quantifying Shared Feature Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much effort has been made to explain and improve the success of transfer-based attacks (TBA) on black-box computer vision models. This work provides the first attempt at a priori prediction of attack success by identifying the presence of vulnerable features within target models. Recent work by Chen and Liu (2024) proposed the manifold attack model, a unifying framework proposing that successful TBA exist in a common manifold space. Our work experimentally tests the common manifold space hypothesis by a new methodology: first, projecting feature vectors from surrogate and target feature extractors trained on ImageNet onto the same low-dimensional manifold; second, quantifying any observed structure similarities on the manifold; and finally, by relating these observed similarities to the success of the TBA. We find that shared feature representation moderately correlates with increased success of TBA (\r{ho}= 0.56). This method may be used to predict whether an attack will transfer without information of the model weights, training, architecture or details of the attack. The results confirm the presence of shared feature representations between two feature extractors of different sizes and complexities, and demonstrate the utility of datasets from different target domains as test signals for interpreting black-box feature representations.</description>

      <title>MotionShop: Zero-Shot Motion Transfer in Video Diffusion Models with Mixture of Score Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose the first motion transfer approach in diffusion transformer through Mixture of Score Guidance (MSG), a theoretically-grounded framework for motion transfer in diffusion models. Our key theoretical contribution lies in reformulating conditional score to decompose motion score and content score in diffusion models. By formulating motion transfer as a mixture of potential energies, MSG naturally preserves scene composition and enables creative scene transformations while maintaining the integrity of transferred motion patterns. This novel sampling operates directly on pre-trained video diffusion models without additional training or fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, MSG demonstrates successful handling of diverse scenarios including single object, multiple objects, and cross-object motion transfer as well as complex camera motion transfer. Additionally, we introduce MotionBench, the first motion transfer dataset consisting of 200 source videos and 1000 transferred motions, covering single/multi-object transfers, and complex camera motions.</description>

      <title>CALICO: Conversational Agent Localization via Synthetic Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present CALICO, a method to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) to localize conversational agent training data from one language to another. For slots (named entities), CALICO supports three operations: verbatim copy, literal translation, and localization, i.e. generating slot values more appropriate in the target language, such as city and airport names located in countries where the language is spoken. Furthermore, we design an iterative filtering mechanism to discard noisy generated samples, which we show boosts the performance of the downstream conversational agent. To prove the effectiveness of CALICO, we build and release a new human-localized (HL) version of the MultiATIS++ travel information test set in 8 languages. Compared to the original human-translated (HT) version of the test set, we show that our new HL version is more challenging. We also show that CALICO out-performs state-of-the-art LINGUIST (which relies on literal slot translation out of context) both on the HT case, where CALICO generates more accurate slot translations, and on the HL case, where CALICO generates localized slots which are closer to the HL test set.</description>

      <title>HiVeGen -- Hierarchical LLM-based Verilog Generation for Scalable Chip Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With Large Language Models (LLMs) recently demonstrating impressive proficiency in code generation, it is promising to extend their abilities to Hardware Description Language (HDL). However, LLMs tend to generate single HDL code blocks rather than hierarchical structures for hardware designs, leading to hallucinations, particularly in complex designs like Domain-Specific Accelerators (DSAs). To address this, we propose HiVeGen, a hierarchical LLM-based Verilog generation framework that decomposes generation tasks into LLM-manageable hierarchical submodules. HiVeGen further harnesses the advantages of such hierarchical structures by integrating automatic Design Space Exploration (DSE) into hierarchy-aware prompt generation, introducing weight-based retrieval to enhance code reuse, and enabling real-time human-computer interaction to lower error-correction cost, significantly improving the quality of generated designs.</description>

      <title>FogROS2-FT: Fault Tolerant Cloud Robotics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloud robotics enables robots to offload complex computational tasks to cloud servers for performance and ease of management. However, cloud compute can be costly, cloud services can suffer occasional downtime, and connectivity between the robot and cloud can be prone to variations in network Quality-of-Service (QoS). We present FogROS2-FT (Fault Tolerant) to mitigate these issues by introducing a multi-cloud extension that automatically replicates independent stateless robotic services, routes requests to these replicas, and directs the first response back. With replication, robots can still benefit from cloud computations even when a cloud service provider is down or there is low QoS. Additionally, many cloud computing providers offer low-cost spot computing instances that may shutdown unpredictably. Normally, these low-cost instances would be inappropriate for cloud robotics, but the fault tolerance nature of FogROS2-FT allows them to be used reliably. We demonstrate FogROS2-FT fault tolerance capabilities in 3 cloud-robotics scenarios in simulation (visual object detection, semantic segmentation, motion planning) and 1 physical robot experiment (scan-pick-and-place). Running on the same hardware specification, FogROS2-FT achieves motion planning with up to 2.2x cost reduction and up to a 5.53x reduction on 99 Percentile (P99) long-tail latency. FogROS2-FT reduces the P99 long-tail latency of object detection and semantic segmentation by 2.0x and 2.1x, respectively, under network slowdown and resource contention.</description>

      <title>KEDformer:Knowledge Extraction Seasonal Trend Decomposition for Long-term Sequence Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical task in domains such as energy, finance, and meteorology, where accurate long-term predictions are essential. While Transformer-based models have shown promise in capturing temporal dependencies, their application to extended sequences is limited by computational inefficiencies and limited generalization. In this study, we propose KEDformer, a knowledge extraction-driven framework that integrates seasonal-trend decomposition to address these challenges. KEDformer leverages knowledge extraction methods that focus on the most informative weights within the self-attention mechanism to reduce computational overhead. Additionally, the proposed KEDformer framework decouples time series into seasonal and trend components. This decomposition enhances the model's ability to capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term patterns. Extensive experiments on five public datasets from energy, transportation, and weather domains demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of KEDformer, providing an efficient solution for long-term time series forecasting.</description>

      <title>What's the Move? Hybrid Imitation Learning via Salient Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While imitation learning (IL) offers a promising framework for teaching robots various behaviors, learning complex tasks remains challenging. Existing IL policies struggle to generalize effectively across visual and spatial variations even for simple tasks. In this work, we introduce SPHINX: Salient Point-based Hybrid ImitatioN and eXecution, a flexible IL policy that leverages multimodal observations (point clouds and wrist images), along with a hybrid action space of low-frequency, sparse waypoints and high-frequency, dense end effector movements. Given 3D point cloud observations, SPHINX learns to infer task-relevant points within a point cloud, or salient points, which support spatial generalization by focusing on semantically meaningful features. These salient points serve as anchor points to predict waypoints for long-range movement, such as reaching target poses in free-space. Once near a salient point, SPHINX learns to switch to predicting dense end-effector movements given close-up wrist images for precise phases of a task. By exploiting the strengths of different input modalities and action representations for different manipulation phases, SPHINX tackles complex tasks in a sample-efficient, generalizable manner. Our method achieves 86.7% success across 4 real-world and 2 simulated tasks, outperforming the next best state-of-the-art IL baseline by 41.1% on average across 440 real world trials. SPHINX additionally generalizes to novel viewpoints, visual distractors, spatial arrangements, and execution speeds with a 1.7x speedup over the most competitive baseline. Our website (http://sphinx-manip.github.io) provides open-sourced code for data collection, training, and evaluation, along with supplementary videos.</description>

      <title>From Voice to Value: Leveraging AI to Enhance Spoken Online Reviews on the Go</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online reviews help people make better decisions. Review platforms usually depend on typed input, where leaving a good review requires significant effort because users must carefully organize and articulate their thoughts. This may discourage users from leaving comprehensive and high-quality reviews, especially when they are on the go. To address this challenge, we developed Vocalizer, a mobile application that enables users to provide reviews through voice input, with enhancements from a large language model (LLM). In a longitudinal study, we analysed user interactions with the app, focusing on AI-driven features that help refine and improve reviews. Our findings show that users frequently utilized the AI agent to add more detailed information to their reviews. We also show how interactive AI features can improve users self-efficacy and willingness to share reviews online. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of integrating AI assistance into review-writing systems.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Based Approach for Conversational AI-Driven Personal Memory Capture and Retrieval in a Real-world Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TOBU is a novel mobile application that captures and retrieves `personal memories' (pictures/videos together with stories and context around those moments) in a user-engaging AI-guided conversational approach. Our initial prototype showed that existing retrieval techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems fall short due to their limitations in understanding memory relationships, causing low recall, hallucination, and unsatisfactory user experience. We design TOBUGraph, a novel graph-based retrieval approach. During capturing, TOBUGraph leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically create a dynamic knowledge graph of memories, establishing context and relationships of those memories. During retrieval, TOBUGraph combines LLMs with the memory graph to achieve comprehensive recall through graph traversal. Our evaluation using real user data demonstrates that TOBUGraph outperforms multiple RAG implementations in both precision and recall, significantly improving user experience through improved retrieval accuracy and reduced hallucination.</description>

      <title>Towards Effective GenAI Multi-Agent Collaboration: Design and Evaluation for Enterprise Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in problem solving. Through combining many intelligent agents, multi-agent collaboration has emerged as a promising approach to tackle complex, multi-faceted problems that exceed the capabilities of single AI agents. However, designing the collaboration protocols and evaluating the effectiveness of these systems remains a significant challenge, especially for enterprise applications. This report addresses these challenges by presenting a comprehensive evaluation of coordination and routing capabilities in a novel multi-agent collaboration framework. We evaluate two key operational modes: (1) a coordination mode enabling complex task completion through parallel communication and payload referencing, and (2) a routing mode for efficient message forwarding between agents. We benchmark on a set of handcrafted scenarios from three enterprise domains, which are publicly released with the report. For coordination capabilities, we demonstrate the effectiveness of inter-agent communication and payload referencing mechanisms, achieving end-to-end goal success rates of 90%. Our analysis yields several key findings: multi-agent collaboration enhances goal success rates by up to 70% compared to single-agent approaches in our benchmarks; payload referencing improves performance on code-intensive tasks by 23%; latency can be substantially reduced with a routing mechanism that selectively bypasses agent orchestration. These findings offer valuable guidance for enterprise deployments of multi-agent systems and advance the development of scalable, efficient multi-agent collaboration frameworks.</description>

      <title>The BrowserGym Ecosystem for Web Agent Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The BrowserGym ecosystem addresses the growing need for efficient evaluation and benchmarking of web agents, particularly those leveraging automation and Large Language Models (LLMs) for web interaction tasks. Many existing benchmarks suffer from fragmentation and inconsistent evaluation methodologies, making it challenging to achieve reliable comparisons and reproducible results. BrowserGym aims to solve this by providing a unified, gym-like environment with well-defined observation and action spaces, facilitating standardized evaluation across diverse benchmarks. Combined with AgentLab, a complementary framework that aids in agent creation, testing, and analysis, BrowserGym offers flexibility for integrating new benchmarks while ensuring consistent evaluation and comprehensive experiment management. This standardized approach seeks to reduce the time and complexity of developing web agents, supporting more reliable comparisons and facilitating in-depth analysis of agent behaviors, and could result in more adaptable, capable agents, ultimately accelerating innovation in LLM-driven automation. As a supporting evidence, we conduct the first large-scale, multi-benchmark web agent experiment and compare the performance of 6 state-of-the-art LLMs across all benchmarks currently available in BrowserGym. Among other findings, our results highlight a large discrepancy between OpenAI and Anthropic's latests models, with Claude-3.5-Sonnet leading the way on almost all benchmarks, except on vision-related tasks where GPT-4o is superior. Despite these advancements, our results emphasize that building robust and efficient web agents remains a significant challenge, due to the inherent complexity of real-world web environments and the limitations of current models.</description>

      <title>A New Perspective on Time Series Anomaly Detection: Faster Patch-based Broad Learning System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) has been a research hotspot in both academia and industry in recent years. Deep learning methods have become the mainstream research direction due to their excellent performance. However, new viewpoints have emerged in recent TSAD research. Deep learning is not required for TSAD due to limitations such as slow deep learning speed. The Broad Learning System (BLS) is a shallow network framework that benefits from its ease of optimization and speed. It has been shown to outperform machine learning approaches while remaining competitive with deep learning. Based on the current situation of TSAD, we propose the Contrastive Patch-based Broad Learning System (CPatchBLS). This is a new exploration of patching technique and BLS, providing a new perspective for TSAD. We construct Dual-PatchBLS as a base through patching and Simple Kernel Perturbation (SKP) and utilize contrastive learning to capture the differences between normal and abnormal data under different representations. To compensate for the temporal semantic loss caused by various patching, we propose CPatchBLS with model level integration, which takes advantage of BLS's fast feature to build model-level integration and improve model detection. Using five real-world series anomaly detection datasets, we confirmed the method's efficacy, outperforming previous deep learning and machine learning methods while retaining a high level of computing efficiency.</description>

      <title>Trimming Down Large Spiking Vision Transformers via Heterogeneous Quantization Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are amenable to deployment on edge devices and neuromorphic hardware due to their lower dissipation. Recently, SNN-based transformers have garnered significant interest, incorporating attention mechanisms akin to their counterparts in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) while demonstrating excellent performance. However, deploying large spiking transformer models on resource-constrained edge devices such as mobile phones, still poses significant challenges resulted from the high computational demands of large uncompressed high-precision models. In this work, we introduce a novel heterogeneous quantization method for compressing spiking transformers through layer-wise quantization. Our approach optimizes the quantization of each layer using one of two distinct quantization schemes, i.e., uniform or power-of-two quantification, with mixed bit resolutions. Our heterogeneous quantization demonstrates the feasibility of maintaining high performance for spiking transformers while utilizing an average effective resolution of 3.14-3.67 bits with less than a 1% accuracy drop on DVS Gesture and CIFAR10-DVS datasets. It attains a model compression rate of 8.71x-10.19x for standard floating-point spiking transformers. Moreover, the proposed approach achieves a significant energy reduction of 5.69x, 8.72x, and 10.2x while maintaining high accuracy levels of 85.3%, 97.57%, and 80.4% on N-Caltech101, DVS-Gesture, and CIFAR10-DVS datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Memory-enhanced Invariant Prompt Learning for Urban Flow Prediction under Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban flow prediction is a classic spatial-temporal forecasting task that estimates the amount of future traffic flow for a given location. Though models represented by Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have established themselves as capable predictors, they tend to suffer from distribution shifts that are common with the urban flow data due to the dynamics and unpredictability of spatial-temporal events. Unfortunately, in spatial-temporal applications, the dynamic environments can hardly be quantified via a fixed number of parameters, whereas learning time- and location-specific environments can quickly become computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Memory-enhanced Invariant Prompt learning (MIP) for urban flow prediction under constant distribution shifts. Specifically, MIP is equipped with a learnable memory bank that is trained to memorize the causal features within the spatial-temporal graph. By querying a trainable memory bank that stores the causal features, we adaptively extract invariant and variant prompts (i.e., patterns) for a given location at every time step. Then, instead of intervening the raw data based on simulated environments, we directly perform intervention on variant prompts across space and time. With the intervened variant prompts in place, we use invariant learning to minimize the variance of predictions, so as to ensure that the predictions are only made with invariant features. With extensive comparative experiments on two public urban flow datasets, we thoroughly demonstrate the robustness of MIP against OOD data.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Evaluation of Multimodal AI Models in Medical Imaging Diagnosis: From Data Augmentation to Preference-Based Comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces an evaluation framework for multimodal models in medical imaging diagnostics. We developed a pipeline incorporating data preprocessing, model inference, and preference-based evaluation, expanding an initial set of 500 clinical cases to 3,000 through controlled augmentation. Our method combined medical images with clinical observations to generate assessments, using Claude 3.5 Sonnet for independent evaluation against physician-authored diagnoses. The results indicated varying performance across models, with Llama 3.2-90B outperforming human diagnoses in 85.27% of cases. In contrast, specialized vision models like BLIP2 and Llava showed preferences in 41.36% and 46.77% of cases, respectively. This framework highlights the potential of large multimodal models to outperform human diagnostics in certain tasks.</description>

      <title>Towards 3D Acceleration for low-power Mixture-of-Experts and Multi-Head Attention Spiking Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks(SNNs) provide a brain-inspired and event-driven mechanism that is believed to be critical to unlock energy-efficient deep learning. The mixture-of-experts approach mirrors the parallel distributed processing of nervous systems, introducing conditional computation policies and expanding model capacity without scaling up the number of computational operations. Additionally, spiking mixture-of-experts self-attention mechanisms enhance representation capacity, effectively capturing diverse patterns of entities and dependencies between visual or linguistic tokens. However, there is currently a lack of hardware support for highly parallel distributed processing needed by spiking transformers, which embody a brain-inspired computation. This paper introduces the first 3D hardware architecture and design methodology for Mixture-of-Experts and Multi-Head Attention spiking transformers. By leveraging 3D integration with memory-on-logic and logic-on-logic stacking, we explore such brain-inspired accelerators with spatially stackable circuitry, demonstrating significant optimization of energy efficiency and latency compared to conventional 2D CMOS integration.</description>

      <title>KG-Retriever: Efficient Knowledge Indexing for Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models with retrieval-augmented generation encounter a pivotal challenge in intricate retrieval tasks, e.g., multi-hop question answering, which requires the model to navigate across multiple documents and generate comprehensive responses based on fragmented information. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel Knowledge Graph-based RAG framework with a hierarchical knowledge retriever, termed KG-Retriever. The retrieval indexing in KG-Retriever is constructed on a hierarchical index graph that consists of a knowledge graph layer and a collaborative document layer. The associative nature of graph structures is fully utilized to strengthen intra-document and inter-document connectivity, thereby fundamentally alleviating the information fragmentation problem and meanwhile improving the retrieval efficiency in cross-document retrieval of LLMs. With the coarse-grained collaborative information from neighboring documents and concise information from the knowledge graph, KG-Retriever achieves marked improvements on five public QA datasets, showing the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed RAG framework.</description>

      <title>SAME: Learning Generic Language-Guided Visual Navigation with State-Adaptive Mixture of Experts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The academic field of learning instruction-guided visual navigation can be generally categorized into high-level category-specific search and low-level language-guided navigation, depending on the granularity of language instruction, in which the former emphasizes the exploration process, while the latter concentrates on following detailed textual commands. Despite the differing focuses of these tasks, the underlying requirements of interpreting instructions, comprehending the surroundings, and inferring action decisions remain consistent. This paper consolidates diverse navigation tasks into a unified and generic framework -- we investigate the core difficulties of sharing general knowledge and exploiting task-specific capabilities in learning navigation and propose a novel State-Adaptive Mixture of Experts (SAME) model that effectively enables an agent to infer decisions based on different-granularity language and dynamic observations. Powered by SAME, we present a versatile agent capable of addressing seven navigation tasks simultaneously that outperforms or achieves highly comparable performance to task-specific agents.</description>

      <title>Fragmented Layer Grouping in GUI Designs Through Graph Learning Based on Multimodal Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatically constructing GUI groups of different granularities constitutes a critical intelligent step towards automating GUI design and implementation tasks. Specifically, in the industrial GUI-to-code process, fragmented layers may decrease the readability and maintainability of generated code, which can be alleviated by grouping semantically consistent fragmented layers in the design prototypes. This study aims to propose a graph-learning-based approach to tackle the fragmented layer grouping problem according to multi-modal information in design prototypes. Our graph learning module consists of self-attention and graph neural network modules. By taking the multimodal fused representation of GUI layers as input, we innovatively group fragmented layers by classifying GUI layers and regressing the bounding boxes of the corresponding GUI components simultaneously. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. A further user study is also conducted to validate that our approach can assist an intelligent downstream tool in generating more maintainable and readable front-end code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging yet crucial task due to the inherent complexity and diversity of human emotions. To address this problem, researchers attempt to fuse information from other modalities via multimodal learning. However, existing multimodal fusion techniques often overlook the intricacies of cross-modal interactions, resulting in suboptimal feature representations. In this paper, we propose WavFusion, a multimodal speech emotion recognition framework that addresses critical research problems in effective multimodal fusion, heterogeneity among modalities, and discriminative representation learning. By leveraging a gated cross-modal attention mechanism and multimodal homogeneous feature discrepancy learning, WavFusion demonstrates improved performance over existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. Our work highlights the importance of capturing nuanced cross-modal interactions and learning discriminative representations for accurate multimodal SER. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets (IEMOCAP and MELD) demonstrate that WavFusion succeeds over the state-of-the-art strategies on emotion recognition.</description>

      <title>Text-to-3D Gaussian Splatting with Physics-Grounded Motion Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-3D generation is a valuable technology in virtual reality and digital content creation. While recent works have pushed the boundaries of text-to-3D generation, producing high-fidelity 3D objects with inefficient prompts and simulating their physics-grounded motion accurately still remain unsolved challenges. To address these challenges, we present an innovative framework that utilizes the Large Language Model (LLM)-refined prompts and diffusion priors-guided Gaussian Splatting (GS) for generating 3D models with accurate appearances and geometric structures. We also incorporate a continuum mechanics-based deformation map and color regularization to synthesize vivid physics-grounded motion for the generated 3D Gaussians, adhering to the conservation of mass and momentum. By integrating text-to-3D generation with physics-grounded motion synthesis, our framework renders photo-realistic 3D objects that exhibit physics-aware motion, accurately reflecting the behaviors of the objects under various forces and constraints across different materials. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality 3D generations with realistic physics-grounded motion.</description>

      <title>On the Expressive Power of Modern Hopfield Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern Hopfield networks (MHNs) have emerged as powerful tools in deep learning, capable of replacing components such as pooling layers, LSTMs, and attention mechanisms. Recent advancements have enhanced their storage capacity, retrieval speed, and error rates. However, the fundamental limits of their computational expressiveness remain unexplored. Understanding the expressive power of MHNs is crucial for optimizing their integration into deep learning architectures. In this work, we establish rigorous theoretical bounds on the computational capabilities of MHNs using circuit complexity theory. Our key contribution is that we show that MHNs are $\mathsf{DLOGTIME}$-uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$. Hence, unless $\mathsf{TC}^0 = \mathsf{NC}^1$, a $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-precision modern Hopfield networks with a constant number of layers and $O(n)$ hidden dimension cannot solve $\mathsf{NC}^1$-hard problems such as the undirected graph connectivity problem and the tree isomorphism problem. We also extended our results to Kernelized Hopfield Networks. These results demonstrate the limitation in the expressive power of the modern Hopfield networks. Moreover, Our theoretical analysis provides insights to guide the development of new Hopfield-based architectures.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Uncertainty Quantification of Large Language Models: Taxonomy, Open Research Challenges, and Future Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable performance of large language models (LLMs) in content generation, coding, and common-sense reasoning has spurred widespread integration into many facets of society. However, integration of LLMs raises valid questions on their reliability and trustworthiness, given their propensity to generate hallucinations: plausible, factually-incorrect responses, which are expressed with striking confidence. Previous work has shown that hallucinations and other non-factual responses generated by LLMs can be detected by examining the uncertainty of the LLM in its response to the pertinent prompt, driving significant research efforts devoted to quantifying the uncertainty of LLMs. This survey seeks to provide an extensive review of existing uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs, identifying their salient features, along with their strengths and weaknesses. We present existing methods within a relevant taxonomy, unifying ostensibly disparate methods to aid understanding of the state of the art. Furthermore, we highlight applications of uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs, spanning chatbot and textual applications to embodied artificial intelligence applications in robotics. We conclude with open research challenges in uncertainty quantification of LLMs, seeking to motivate future research.</description>

      <title>Neighborhood Commonality-aware Evolution Network for Continuous Generalized Category Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD) aims to continually discover novel classes from unlabelled image sets while maintaining performance on old classes. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework, dubbed Neighborhood Commonality-aware Evolution Network (NCENet) that conquers this task from the perspective of representation learning. Concretely, to learn discriminative representations for novel classes, a Neighborhood Commonality-aware Representation Learning (NCRL) is designed, which exploits local commonalities derived neighborhoods to guide the learning of representational differences between instances of different classes. To maintain the representation ability for old classes, a Bi-level Contrastive Knowledge Distillation (BCKD) module is designed, which leverages contrastive learning to perceive the learning and learned knowledge and conducts knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate the superior performance of NCENet compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. Particularly, in the last incremental learning session on CIFAR100, the clustering accuracy of NCENet outperforms the second-best method by a margin of 3.09\% on old classes and by a margin of 6.32\% on new classes. Our code will be publicly available at \href{https://github.com/xjtuYW/NCENet.git}{https://github.com/xjtuYW/NCENet.git}. \end{abstract}</description>

      <title>Electrocardiogram (ECG) Based Cardiac Arrhythmia Detection and Classification using Machine Learning Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence, specifically Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), have opened new prospects in medical sciences for improved diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of severe health conditions. This paper focuses on the development of an ML model with high predictive accuracy to classify arrhythmic electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The ECG signals datasets utilized in this study were sourced from the PhysioNet and MIT-BIH databases. The research commenced with binary classification, where an optimized Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model yielded excellent results in differentiating normal and atrial fibrillation signals. A pivotal aspect of this research was a survey among medical professionals, which not only validated the practicality of AI-based ECG classifiers but also identified areas for improvement, including accuracy and the inclusion of more arrhythmia types. These insights drove the development of an advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) system capable of classifying five different types of ECG signals with better accuracy and precision. The CNN model's robust performance was ensured through rigorous stratified 5-fold cross validation. A web portal was also developed to demonstrate real-world utility, offering access to the trained model for real-time classification. This study highlights the potential applications of such models in remote health monitoring, predictive healthcare, assistive diagnostic tools, and simulated environments for educational training and interdisciplinary collaboration between data scientists and medical personnel.</description>

      <title>UMSPU: Universal Multi-Size Phase Unwrapping via Mutual Self-Distillation and Adaptive Boosting Ensemble Segmenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial phase unwrapping is a key technique for extracting phase information to obtain 3D morphology and other features. Modern industrial measurement scenarios demand high precision, large image sizes, and high speed. However, conventional methods struggle with noise resistance and processing speed. Current deep learning methods are limited by the receptive field size and sparse semantic information, making them ineffective for large size images. To address this issue, we propose a mutual self-distillation (MSD) mechanism and adaptive boosting ensemble segmenters to construct a universal multi-size phase unwrapping network (UMSPU). MSD performs hierarchical attention refinement and achieves cross-layer collaborative learning through bidirectional distillation, ensuring fine-grained semantic representation across image sizes. The adaptive boosting ensemble segmenters combine weak segmenters with different receptive fields into a strong one, ensuring stable segmentation across spatial frequencies. Experimental results show that UMSPU overcomes image size limitations, achieving high precision across image sizes ranging from 256*256 to 2048*2048 (an 8 times increase). It also outperforms existing methods in speed, robustness, and generalization. Its practicality is further validated in structured light imaging and InSAR. We believe that UMSPU offers a universal solution for phase unwrapping, with broad potential for industrial applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breast cancer stands as a prevalent cause of fatality among females on a global scale, with prompt detection playing a pivotal role in diminishing mortality rates. The utilization of ultrasound scans in the BUSI dataset for medical imagery pertaining to breast cancer has exhibited commendable segmentation outcomes through the application of UNet and UNet++ networks. Nevertheless, a notable drawback of these models resides in their inattention towards the temporal aspects embedded within the images. This research endeavors to enrich the UNet++ architecture by integrating LSTM layers and self-attention mechanisms to exploit temporal characteristics for segmentation purposes. Furthermore, the incorporation of a Multiscale Feature Extraction Module aims to grasp varied scale features within the UNet++. Through the amalgamation of our proposed methodology with data augmentation on the BUSI with GT dataset, an accuracy rate of 98.88%, specificity of 99.53%, precision of 95.34%, sensitivity of 91.20%, F1-score of 93.74, and Dice coefficient of 92.74% are achieved. These findings demonstrate competitiveness with cutting-edge techniques outlined in existing literature.</description>

      <title>GEE-OPs: An Operator Knowledge Base for Geospatial Code Generation on the Google Earth Engine Platform Powered by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the scale and complexity of spatiotemporal data continue to grow rapidly, the use of geospatial modeling on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform presents dual challenges: improving the coding efficiency of domain experts and enhancing the coding capabilities of interdisciplinary users. To address these challenges and improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) in geospatial code generation tasks, we propose a framework for building a geospatial operator knowledge base tailored to the GEE JavaScript API. This framework consists of an operator syntax knowledge table, an operator relationship frequency table, an operator frequent pattern knowledge table, and an operator relationship chain knowledge table. By leveraging Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) techniques and frequent itemset mining, we systematically extract operator knowledge from 185,236 real GEE scripts and syntax documentation, forming a structured knowledge base. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework achieves over 90% accuracy, recall, and F1 score in operator knowledge extraction. When integrated with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy for LLM-based geospatial code generation tasks, the knowledge base improves performance by 20-30%. Ablation studies further quantify the necessity of each knowledge table in the knowledge base construction. This work provides robust support for the advancement and application of geospatial code modeling techniques, offering an innovative approach to constructing domain-specific knowledge bases that enhance the code generation capabilities of LLMs, and fostering the deeper integration of generative AI technologies within the field of geoinformatics.</description>

Abstract: Multidomain sentiment analysis involves estimating the polarity of an unstructured text by exploiting domain specific information. One of the main issues common to the approaches discussed in the literature is their poor applicability to domains that differ from those used to construct opinion models.This paper aims to present a new method for Persian multidomain SA analysis using deep learning approaches. The proposed BERTCapsules approach consists of a combination of BERT and Capsule models. In this approach, BERT was used for Instance representation, and Capsule Structure was used to learn the extracted graphs. Digikala dataset, including ten domains with both positive and negative polarity, was used to evaluate this approach. The evaluation of the BERTCaps model achieved an accuracy of 0.9712 in sentiment classification binary classification and 0.8509 in domain classification .</description>

      <title>Real-Time 3D Object Detection Using InnovizOne LiDAR and Low-Power Hailo-8 AI Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object detection is a significant field in autonomous driving. Popular sensors for this task include cameras and LiDAR sensors. LiDAR sensors offer several advantages, such as insensitivity to light changes, like in a dark setting and the ability to provide 3D information in the form of point clouds, which include the ranges of objects. However, 3D detection methods, such as PointPillars, typically require high-power hardware. Additionally, most common spinning LiDARs are sparse and may not achieve the desired quality of object detection in front of the car. In this paper, we present the feasibility of performing real-time 3D object detection of cars using 3D point clouds from a LiDAR sensor, processed and deployed on a low-power Hailo-8 AI accelerator. The LiDAR sensor used in this study is the InnovizOne sensor, which captures objects in higher quality compared to spinning LiDAR techniques, especially for distant objects. We successfully achieved real-time inference at a rate of approximately 5Hz with a high accuracy of 0.91% F1 score, with only -0.2% degradation compared to running the same model on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. This work demonstrates that effective real-time 3D object detection can be achieved on low-cost, low-power hardware, representing a significant step towards more accessible autonomous driving technologies.

      <title>Remix-DiT: Mixing Diffusion Transformers for Multi-Expert Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based diffusion models have achieved significant advancements across a variety of generative tasks. However, producing high-quality outputs typically necessitates large transformer models, which result in substantial training and inference overhead. In this work, we investigate an alternative approach involving multiple experts for denoising, and introduce Remix-DiT, a novel method designed to enhance output quality at a low cost. The goal of Remix-DiT is to craft N diffusion experts for different denoising timesteps, yet without the need for expensive training of N independent models. To achieve this, Remix-DiT employs K basis models (where K &lt; N) and utilizes learnable mixing coefficients to adaptively craft expert models. This design offers two significant advantages: first, although the total model size is increased, the model produced by the mixing operation shares the same architecture as a plain model, making the overall model as efficient as a standard diffusion transformer. Second, the learnable mixing adaptively allocates model capacity across timesteps, thereby effectively improving generation quality. Experiments conducted on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that Remix-DiT achieves promising results compared to standard diffusion transformers and other multiple-expert methods. The code is available at https://github.com/VainF/Remix-DiT.</description>

      <title>CharacterBox: Evaluating the Role-Playing Capabilities of LLMs in Text-Based Virtual Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Role-playing is a crucial capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling a wide range of practical applications, including intelligent non-player characters, digital twins, and emotional companions. Evaluating this capability in LLMs is challenging due to the complex dynamics involved in role-playing, such as maintaining character fidelity throughout a storyline and navigating open-ended narratives without a definitive ground truth. Current evaluation methods, which primarily focus on question-answering or conversational snapshots, fall short of adequately capturing the nuanced character traits and behaviors essential for authentic role-playing. In this paper, we propose CharacterBox, which is a simulation sandbox designed to generate situational fine-grained character behavior trajectories. These behavior trajectories enable a more comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of role-playing capabilities. CharacterBox consists of two main components: the character agent and the narrator agent. The character agent, grounded in psychological and behavioral science, exhibits human-like behaviors, while the narrator agent coordinates interactions between character agents and environmental changes. Additionally, we introduce two trajectory-based methods that leverage CharacterBox to enhance LLM performance. To reduce costs and facilitate the adoption of CharacterBox by public communities, we fine-tune two smaller models, CharacterNR and CharacterRM, as substitutes for GPT API calls, and demonstrate their competitive performance compared to advanced GPT APIs.</description>

      <title>Biological Brain Age Estimation using Sex-Aware Adversarial Variational Autoencoder with Multimodal Neuroimages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain aging involves structural and functional changes and therefore serves as a key biomarker for brain health. Combining structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has the potential to improve brain age estimation by leveraging complementary data. However, fMRI data, being noisier than sMRI, complicates multimodal fusion. Traditional fusion methods often introduce more noise than useful information, which can reduce accuracy compared to using sMRI alone. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal framework for biological brain age estimation, utilizing a sex-aware adversarial variational autoencoder (SA-AVAE). Our framework integrates adversarial and variational learning to effectively disentangle the latent features from both modalities. Specifically, we decompose the latent space into modality-specific codes and shared codes to represent complementary and common information across modalities, respectively. To enhance the disentanglement, we introduce cross-reconstruction and shared-distinct distance ratio loss as regularization terms. Importantly, we incorporate sex information into the learned latent code, enabling the model to capture sex-specific aging patterns for brain age estimation via an integrated regressor module. We evaluate our model using the publicly available OpenBHB dataset, a comprehensive multi-site dataset for brain age estimation. The results from ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing approaches and shows significant robustness across various age groups, highlighting its potential for real-time clinical applications in the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

      <title>Hyperedge Anomaly Detection with Hypergraph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypergraph is a data structure that enables us to model higher-order associations among data entities. Conventional graph-structured data can represent pairwise relationships only, whereas hypergraph enables us to associate any number of entities, which is essential in many real-life applications. Hypergraph learning algorithms have been well-studied for numerous problem settings, such as node classification, link prediction, etc. However, much less research has been conducted on anomaly detection from hypergraphs. Anomaly detection identifies events that deviate from the usual pattern and can be applied to hypergraphs to detect unusual higher-order associations. In this work, we propose an end-to-end hypergraph neural network-based model for identifying anomalous associations in a hypergraph. Our proposed algorithm operates in an unsupervised manner without requiring any labeled data. Extensive experimentation on several real-life datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our model in detecting anomalous hyperedges.</description>

      <title>Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Diseases and Dementia from MRI Images Using an Ensemble Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that can result in significant cognitive impairment and dementia. Accurate and timely diagnosis is essential for effective treatment and management of this disease. In this study, we proposed two low-parameter Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), IR-BRAINNET and Modified-DEMNET, designed to detect the early stages of AD accurately. We also introduced an ensemble model that averages their outputs to reduce variance across the CNNs and enhance AD detection. Both CNNs are trained, and all models are evaluated using a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) dataset from the Kaggle database. The dataset includes images of four stages of dementia, with an uneven class distribution. To mitigate challenges stemming from the inherent imbalance in the dataset, we employed the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to generate additional instances for minority classes. In the NO-SMOTE scenario, despite the imbalanced distribution, the ensemble model achieved 98.28% accuracy, outperforming IR-BRAINNET (97.26%) and Modified-DEMNET (95.54%), with Wilcoxon p-values of 2.9e-3 and 5.20e-6, respectively, indicating significant improvement in correct predictions through the use of the average function. In the SMOTE scenario, the ensemble model achieved 99.92% accuracy (1.64% improvement over NO-SMOTE), IR-BRAINNET reached 99.80% (2.54% improvement), and Modified-DEMNET attained 99.72% (4.18% improvement). Based on the experimental findings, averaging the models' outputs enhanced AD diagnosis in both scenarios, while the diversity in the dataset introduced by SMOTE-generated instances significantly improved performance. Furthermore, the compact models we proposed outperformed those from previous studies, even in the presence of an imbalanced distribution.</description>

      <title>Training neural networks without backpropagation using particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are a group of neurons stacked together in multiple layers to mimic the biological neurons in a human brain. Neural networks have been trained using the backpropagation algorithm based on gradient descent strategy for several decades. Several variants have been developed to improve the backpropagation algorithm. The loss function for the neural network is optimized through backpropagation, but several local minima exist in the manifold of the constructed neural network. We obtain several solutions matching the minima. The gradient descent strategy cannot avoid the problem of local minima and gets stuck in the minima due to the initialization. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) was proposed to select the best local minima among the search space of the loss function. The search space is limited to the instantiated particles in the PSO algorithm, and sometimes it cannot select the best solution. In the proposed approach, we overcome the problem of gradient descent and the limitation of the PSO algorithm by training individual neurons separately, capable of collectively solving the problem as a group of neurons forming a network.</description>

      <title>No-Free-Lunch Theories for Tensor-Network Machine Learning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network machine learning models have shown remarkable versatility in tackling complex data-driven tasks, ranging from quantum many-body problems to classical pattern recognitions. Despite their promising performance, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying assumptions and limitations of these models is still lacking. In this work, we focus on the rigorous formulation of their no-free-lunch theorem -- essential yet notoriously challenging to formalize for specific tensor network machine learning models. In particular, we rigorously analyze the generalization risks of learning target output functions from input data encoded in tensor network states. We first prove a no-free-lunch theorem for machine learning models based on matrix product states, i.e., the one-dimensional tensor network states. Furthermore, we circumvent the challenging issue of calculating the partition function for two-dimensional Ising model, and prove the no-free-lunch theorem for the case of two-dimensional projected entangled-pair state, by introducing the combinatorial method associated to the "puzzle of polyominoes". Our findings reveal the intrinsic limitations of tensor network-based learning models in a rigorous fashion, and open up an avenue for future analytical exploration of both the strengths and limitations of quantum-inspired machine learning frameworks.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Time-Series Foundation Model for Subsurface Well Logs Prediction and Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise in energy demand highlights the importance of suitable subsurface storage, requiring detailed and accurate subsurface characterization often reliant on high-quality borehole well log data. However, obtaining complete well-log data is costly and time-consuming, with missing data being common due to borehole conditions or tool errors. While machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been implemented to address these issues, they often fail to capture the intricate, nonlinear relationships and long-term dependencies in complex well log sequences. Additionally, prior AI-driven models typically require retraining when introduced to new datasets and are constrained to deployment in the same basin.
  In this study, we explored and evaluated the potential of a time-series foundation model leveraging transformer architecture and a generative pre-trained approach for predicting and detecting anomalies in borehole well log data. Specifically, we fine-tuned and adopted the TimeGPT architecture to forecast key log responses and detect anomalies with high accuracy. Our proposed model demonstrated excellent performance, achieving R2 of up to 87% and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as low as 1.95%. Additionally, the model's zero-shot capability successfully identified subtle yet critical anomalies, such as drilling hazards or unexpected geological formations, with an overall accuracy of 93%.
  The model represents a significant advancement in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, enabling zero-shot inference through fine-tuning. Its application in well-log prediction enhances operational decision-making while reducing risks associated with subsurface exploration. These findings demonstrate the model's potential to transform well-log data analysis, particularly in complex geological settings.</description>

      <title>HMGIE: Hierarchical and Multi-Grained Inconsistency Evaluation for Vision-Language Data Cleansing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual-textual inconsistency (VTI) evaluation plays a crucial role in cleansing vision-language data. Its main challenges stem from the high variety of image captioning datasets, where differences in content can create a range of inconsistencies (\eg, inconsistencies in scene, entities, entity attributes, entity numbers, entity interactions). Moreover, variations in caption length can introduce inconsistencies at different levels of granularity as well. To tackle these challenges, we design an adaptive evaluation framework, called Hierarchical and Multi-Grained Inconsistency Evaluation (HMGIE), which can provide multi-grained evaluations covering both accuracy and completeness for various image-caption pairs. Specifically, the HMGIE framework is implemented by three consecutive modules. Firstly, the semantic graph generation module converts the image caption to a semantic graph for building a structural representation of all involved semantic items. Then, the hierarchical inconsistency evaluation module provides a progressive evaluation procedure with a dynamic question-answer generation and evaluation strategy guided by the semantic graph, producing a hierarchical inconsistency evaluation graph (HIEG). Finally, the quantitative evaluation module calculates the accuracy and completeness scores based on the HIEG, followed by a natural language explanation about the detection results. Moreover, to verify the efficacy and flexibility of the proposed framework on handling different image captioning datasets, we construct MVTID, an image-caption dataset with diverse types and granularities of inconsistencies. Extensive experiments on MVTID and other benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed HMGIE to current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Neural network interpretability with layer-wise relevance propagation: novel techniques for neuron selection and visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpreting complex neural networks is crucial for understanding their decision-making processes, particularly in applications where transparency and accountability are essential. This proposed method addresses this need by focusing on layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), a technique used in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to attribute neural network outputs to input features through backpropagated relevance scores. Existing LRP methods often struggle with precision in evaluating individual neuron contributions. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel approach that improves the parsing of selected neurons during LRP backward propagation, using the Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16) architecture as a case study. Our method creates neural network graphs to highlight critical paths and visualizes these paths with heatmaps, optimizing neuron selection through accuracy metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE). Additionally, we utilize a deconvolutional visualization technique to reconstruct feature maps, offering a comprehensive view of the network's inner workings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances interpretability and supports the development of more transparent artificial intelligence (AI) systems for computer vision applications. This advancement has the potential to improve the trustworthiness of AI models in real-world machine vision applications, thereby increasing their reliability and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Flow-based Detection of Botnets through Bio-inspired Optimisation of Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Botnets could autonomously infect, propagate, communicate and coordinate with other members in the botnet, enabling cybercriminals to exploit the cumulative computing and bandwidth of its bots to facilitate cybercrime. Traditional detection methods are becoming increasingly unsuitable against various network-based detection evasion methods. These techniques ultimately render signature-based fingerprinting detection infeasible and thus this research explores the application of network flow-based behavioural modelling to facilitate the binary classification of bot network activity, whereby the detection is independent of underlying communications architectures, ports, protocols and payload-based detection evasion mechanisms. A comparative evaluation of various machine learning classification methods is conducted, to precisely determine the average accuracy of each classifier on bot datasets like CTU-13, ISOT 2010 and ISCX 2014. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning using Genetic Algorithm (GA), aiming to efficiently converge to the fittest hyperparameter set for each dataset was done. The bioinspired optimisation of Random Forest (RF) with GA achieved an average accuracy of 99.85% when it was tested against the three datasets. The model was then developed into a software product.

      <title>PromptRefine: Enhancing Few-Shot Performance on Low-Resource Indic Languages with Example Selection from Related Example Banks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive few-shot learning capabilities through in-context learning (ICL). However, ICL performance is highly dependent on the choice of few-shot demonstrations, making the selection of the most optimal examples a persistent research challenge. This issue is further amplified in low-resource Indic languages, where the scarcity of ground-truth data complicates the selection process. In this work, we propose PromptRefine, a novel Alternating Minimization approach for example selection that improves ICL performance on low-resource Indic languages. PromptRefine leverages auxiliary example banks from related high-resource Indic languages and employs multi-task learning techniques to align language-specific retrievers, enabling effective cross-language retrieval. Additionally, we incorporate diversity in the selected examples to enhance generalization and reduce bias. Through comprehensive evaluations on four text generation tasks -- Cross-Lingual Question Answering, Multilingual Question Answering, Machine Translation, and Cross-Lingual Summarization using state-of-the-art LLMs such as LLAMA-3.1-8B, LLAMA-2-7B, Qwen-2-7B, and Qwen-2.5-7B, we demonstrate that PromptRefine significantly outperforms existing frameworks for retrieving examples.</description>

      <title>Learning Soft Driving Constraints from Vectorized Scene Embeddings while Imitating Expert Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary goal of motion planning is to generate safe and efficient trajectories for vehicles. Traditionally, motion planning models are trained using imitation learning to mimic the behavior of human experts. However, these models often lack interpretability and fail to provide clear justifications for their decisions. We propose a method that integrates constraint learning into imitation learning by extracting driving constraints from expert trajectories. Our approach utilizes vectorized scene embeddings that capture critical spatial and temporal features, enabling the model to identify and generalize constraints across various driving scenarios. We formulate the constraint learning problem using a maximum entropy model, which scores the motion planner's trajectories based on their similarity to the expert trajectory. By separating the scoring process into distinct reward and constraint streams, we improve both the interpretability of the planner's behavior and its attention to relevant scene components. Unlike existing constraint learning methods that rely on simulators and are typically embedded in reinforcement learning (RL) or inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) frameworks, our method operates without simulators, making it applicable to a wider range of datasets and real-world scenarios. Experimental results on the InD and TrafficJams datasets demonstrate that incorporating driving constraints enhances model interpretability and improves closed-loop performance.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Bayesianization for Low-Rank Adapters of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the uncertainty of responses of Large Language Models~(LLMs) remains a critical challenge. While recent Bayesian methods have demonstrated effectiveness in quantifying uncertainty through low-rank weight updates, they typically require complex fine-tuning or post-training procedures. In this paper, we propose Training-Free Bayesianization~(TFB), a novel framework that transforms existing off-the-shelf trained LoRA adapters into Bayesian ones without additional training. TFB systematically searches for the maximally acceptable level of variance in the weight posterior, constrained within a family of low-rank isotropic Gaussian distributions. We theoretically demonstrate that under mild conditions, this search process is equivalent to variational inference for the weights. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that TFB achieves superior uncertainty estimation and generalization compared to existing methods while eliminating the need for complex training procedures.

      <title>A Tiered GAN Approach for Monet-Style Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proven to be a powerful tool in generating artistic images, capable of mimicking the styles of renowned painters, such as Claude Monet. This paper introduces a tiered GAN model to progressively refine image quality through a multi-stage process, enhancing the generated images at each step. The model transforms random noise into detailed artistic representations, addressing common challenges such as instability in training, mode collapse, and output quality. This approach combines downsampling and convolutional techniques, enabling the generation of high-quality Monet-style artwork while optimizing computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the architecture's ability to produce foundational artistic structures, though further refinements are necessary for achieving higher levels of realism and fidelity to Monet's style. Future work focuses on improving training methodologies and model complexity to bridge the gap between generated and true artistic images. Additionally, the limitations of traditional GANs in artistic generation are analyzed, and strategies to overcome these shortcomings are proposed.</description>

      <title>Black Swan: Abductive and Defeasible Video Reasoning in Unpredictable Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The commonsense reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), especially in abductive reasoning and defeasible reasoning, remain poorly understood. Most benchmarks focus on typical visual scenarios, making it difficult to discern whether model performance stems from keen perception and reasoning skills, or reliance on pure statistical recall. We argue that by focusing on atypical events in videos, clearer insights can be gained on the core capabilities of VLMs. Explaining and understanding such out-of-distribution events requires models to extend beyond basic pattern recognition and regurgitation of their prior knowledge. To this end, we introduce BlackSwanSuite, a benchmark for evaluating VLMs' ability to reason about unexpected events through abductive and defeasible tasks. Our tasks artificially limit the amount of visual information provided to models while questioning them about hidden unexpected events, or provide new visual information that could change an existing hypothesis about the event. We curate a comprehensive benchmark suite comprising over 3,800 MCQ, 4,900 generative and 6,700 yes/no tasks, spanning 1,655 videos. After extensively evaluating various state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, as well as open-source VLMs such as LLaVA-Video, we find significant performance gaps of up to 32% from humans on these tasks. Our findings reveal key limitations in current VLMs, emphasizing the need for enhanced model architectures and training strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a review of recent publications and working papers on ChatGPT and related Large Language Models (LLMs) in accounting and finance. The aim is to understand the current state of research in these two areas and identify potential research opportunities for future inquiry. We identify three common themes from these earlier studies. The first theme focuses on applications of ChatGPT and LLMs in various fields of accounting and finance. The second theme utilizes ChatGPT and LLMs as a new research tool by leveraging their capabilities such as classification, summarization, and text generation. The third theme investigates implications of LLM adoption for accounting and finance professionals, as well as for various organizations and sectors.

      <title>PrivAgent: Agentic-based Red-teaming for LLM Privacy Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have discovered that LLMs have serious privacy leakage concerns, where an LLM may be fooled into outputting private information under carefully crafted adversarial prompts. These risks include leaking system prompts, personally identifiable information, training data, and model parameters. Most existing red-teaming approaches for privacy leakage rely on humans to craft the adversarial prompts. A few automated methods are proposed for system prompt extraction, but they cannot be applied to more severe risks (e.g., training data extraction) and have limited effectiveness even for system prompt extraction.
  In this paper, we propose PrivAgent, a novel black-box red-teaming framework for LLM privacy leakage. We formulate different risks as a search problem with a unified attack goal. Our framework trains an open-source LLM through reinforcement learning as the attack agent to generate adversarial prompts for different target models under different risks. We propose a novel reward function to provide effective and fine-grained rewards for the attack agent. Finally, we introduce customizations to better fit our general framework to system prompt extraction and training data extraction. Through extensive evaluations, we first show that PrivAgent outperforms existing automated methods in system prompt leakage against six popular LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves a 100% success rate in extracting system prompts from real-world applications in OpenAI's GPT Store. We also show PrivAgent's effectiveness in extracting training data from an open-source LLM with a success rate of 5.9%. We further demonstrate PrivAgent's effectiveness in evading the existing guardrail defense and its helpfulness in enabling better safety alignment. Finally, we validate our customized designs through a detailed ablation study. We release our code here https://github.com/rucnyz/RedAgent.</description>

      <title>Charting the Shapes of Stories with Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stories are records of our experiences and their analysis reveals insights into the nature of being human. Successful analyses are often interdisciplinary, leveraging mathematical tools to extract structure from stories and insights from structure. Historically, these tools have been restricted to one dimensional charts and dynamic social networks; however, modern AI offers the possibility of identifying more fully the plot structure, character incentives, and, importantly, counterfactual plot lines that the story could have taken but did not take. In this work, we use AI to model the structure of stories as game-theoretic objects, amenable to quantitative analysis. This allows us to not only interrogate each character's decision making, but also possibly peer into the original author's conception of the characters' world. We demonstrate our proposed technique on Shakespeare's famous Romeo and Juliet. We conclude with a discussion of how our analysis could be replicated in broader contexts, including real-life scenarios.</description>

      <title>Constrained Control for Autonomous Spacecraft Rendezvous: Learning-Based Time Shift Governor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a Time Shift Governor (TSG)-based control scheme to enforce constraints during rendezvous and docking (RD) missions in the setting of the Two-Body problem. As an add-on scheme to the nominal closed-loop system, the TSG generates a time-shifted Chief spacecraft trajectory as a target reference for the Deputy spacecraft. This modification of the commanded reference trajectory ensures that constraints are enforced while the time shift is reduced to zero to effect the rendezvous. Our approach to TSG implementation integrates an LSTM neural network which approximates the time shift parameter as a function of a sequence of past Deputy and Chief spacecraft states. This LSTM neural network is trained offline from simulation data. We report simulation results for RD missions in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and on the Molniya orbit to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. The proposed scheme reduces the time to compute the time shift parameter in most of the scenarios and successfully completes rendezvous missions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an era of widespread influence of Natural Language Processing (NLP), there have been multiple research efforts to supplant traditional manual coding techniques with automated systems capable of generating solutions autonomously. With rapid research for code generation and a sole focus on large language models, there emerges a need to compare and evaluate the performance of transformer architectures based on several complexities of the model. This paper introduces the concept of a "A Comparative Study on Code Generation with Transformers," a model based on Transformer architecture, and NLP methodologies to automatically generate C++ source code for different varieties of problems. Here, a comparative study is performed to evaluate the robustness of transformer-based models on the basis of their architecture complexities and their capability to handle diverse problem sets, from basic arithmetic to complex computations.</description>

      <title>Can OpenAI o1 outperform humans in higher-order cognitive thinking?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of OpenAI's o1-preview model in higher-order cognitive domains, including critical thinking, systematic thinking, computational thinking, data literacy, creative thinking, logical reasoning, and scientific reasoning. Using established benchmarks, we compared the o1-preview models's performance to human participants from diverse educational levels. o1-preview achieved a mean score of 24.33 on the Ennis-Weir Critical Thinking Essay Test (EWCTET), surpassing undergraduate (13.8) and postgraduate (18.39) participants (z = 1.60 and 0.90, respectively). In systematic thinking, it scored 46.1, SD = 4.12 on the Lake Urmia Vignette, significantly outperforming the human mean (20.08, SD = 8.13, z = 3.20). For data literacy, o1-preview scored 8.60, SD = 0.70 on Merk et al.'s "Use Data" dimension, compared to the human post-test mean of 4.17, SD = 2.02 (z = 2.19). On creative thinking tasks, the model achieved originality scores of 2.98, SD = 0.73, higher than the human mean of 1.74 (z = 0.71). In logical reasoning (LogiQA), it outperformed humans with average 90%, SD = 10% accuracy versus 86%, SD = 6.5% (z = 0.62). For scientific reasoning, it achieved near-perfect performance (mean = 0.99, SD = 0.12) on the TOSLS,, exceeding the highest human scores of 0.85, SD = 0.13 (z = 1.78). While o1-preview excelled in structured tasks, it showed limitations in problem-solving and adaptive reasoning. These results demonstrate the potential of AI to complement education in structured assessments but highlight the need for ethical oversight and refinement for broader applications.</description>

      <title>Policy-shaped prediction: avoiding distractions in model-based reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) is a promising route to sample-efficient policy optimization. However, a known vulnerability of reconstruction-based MBRL consists of scenarios in which detailed aspects of the world are highly predictable, but irrelevant to learning a good policy. Such scenarios can lead the model to exhaust its capacity on meaningless content, at the cost of neglecting important environment dynamics. While existing approaches attempt to solve this problem, we highlight its continuing impact on leading MBRL methods -- including DreamerV3 and DreamerPro -- with a novel environment where background distractions are intricate, predictable, and useless for planning future actions. To address this challenge we develop a method for focusing the capacity of the world model through synergy of a pretrained segmentation model, a task-aware reconstruction loss, and adversarial learning. Our method outperforms a variety of other approaches designed to reduce the impact of distractors, and is an advance towards robust model-based reinforcement learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the Iterative Inference Hypothesis (IIH) within the context of transformer-based language models, aiming to understand how a model's latent representations are progressively refined and whether observable differences are present between correct and incorrect generations. Our findings provide empirical support for the IIH, showing that the nth token embedding in the residual stream follows a trajectory of decreasing loss. Additionally, we observe that the rate at which residual embeddings converge to a stable output representation reflects uncertainty in the token generation process. Finally, we introduce a method utilizing cross-entropy to detect this uncertainty and demonstrate its potential to distinguish between correct and incorrect token generations on a dataset of idioms.</description>

      <title>Strategizing Equitable Transit Evacuations: A Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As natural disasters become increasingly frequent, the need for efficient and equitable evacuation planning has become more critical. This paper proposes a data-driven, reinforcement learning-based framework to optimize bus-based evacuations with an emphasis on improving both efficiency and equity. We model the evacuation problem as a Markov Decision Process solved by reinforcement learning, using real-time transit data from General Transit Feed Specification and transportation networks extracted from OpenStreetMap. The reinforcement learning agent dynamically reroutes buses from their scheduled location to minimize total passengers' evacuation time while prioritizing equity-priority communities. Simulations on the San Francisco Bay Area transportation network indicate that the proposed framework achieves significant improvements in both evacuation efficiency and equitable service distribution compared to traditional rule-based and random strategies. These results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to enhance system performance and urban resilience during emergency evacuations, offering a scalable solution for real-world applications in intelligent transportation systems.</description>

      <title>BudgetFusion: Perceptually-Guided Adaptive Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown unprecedented success in the task of text-to-image generation. While these models are capable of generating high-quality and realistic images, the complexity of sequential denoising has raised societal concerns regarding high computational demands and energy consumption. In response, various efforts have been made to improve inference efficiency. However, most of the existing efforts have taken a fixed approach with neural network simplification or text prompt optimization. Are the quality improvements from all denoising computations equally perceivable to humans? We observed that images from different text prompts may require different computational efforts given the desired content. The observation motivates us to present BudgetFusion, a novel model that suggests the most perceptually efficient number of diffusion steps before a diffusion model starts to generate an image. This is achieved by predicting multi-level perceptual metrics relative to diffusion steps. With the popular Stable Diffusion as an example, we conduct both numerical analyses and user studies. Our experiments show that BudgetFusion saves up to five seconds per prompt without compromising perceptual similarity. We hope this work can initiate efforts toward answering a core question: how much do humans perceptually gain from images created by a generative model, per watt of energy?</description>

Abstract: Stable diffusion plays a crucial role in generating high-quality images. However, image generation is time-consuming and memory-intensive. To address this, stable-diffusion.cpp (Sdcpp) emerges as an efficient inference framework to accelerate the diffusion models. Although it is lightweight, the current implementation of ggml_conv_2d operator in Sdcpp is suboptimal, exhibiting both high inference latency and massive memory usage. To address this, in this work, we present an optimized version of Sdcpp leveraging the Winograd algorithm to accelerate 2D convolution operations, which is the primary bottleneck in the pipeline. By analyzing both dependent and independent computation graphs, we exploit the device's locality and parallelism to achieve substantial performance improvements. Our framework delivers correct end-to-end results across various stable diffusion models, including SDv1.4, v1.5, v2.1, SDXL, and SDXL-Turbo. Our evaluation results demonstrate a speedup up to 2.76x for individual convolutional layers and an inference speedup up to 4.79x for the overall image generation process, compared with the original Sdcpp. Homepage: https://github.com/SealAILab/stable-diffusion-cpp</description>

      <title>Language-Guided Image Tokenization for Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image tokenization, the process of transforming raw image pixels into a compact low-dimensional latent representation, has proven crucial for scalable and efficient image generation. However, mainstream image tokenization methods generally have limited compression rates, making high-resolution image generation computationally expensive. To address this challenge, we propose to leverage language for efficient image tokenization, and we call our method Text-Conditioned Image Tokenization (TexTok). TexTok is a simple yet effective tokenization framework that leverages language to provide high-level semantics. By conditioning the tokenization process on descriptive text captions, TexTok allows the tokenization process to focus on encoding fine-grained visual details into latent tokens, leading to enhanced reconstruction quality and higher compression rates. Compared to the conventional tokenizer without text conditioning, TexTok achieves average reconstruction FID improvements of 29.2% and 48.1% on ImageNet-256 and -512 benchmarks respectively, across varying numbers of tokens. These tokenization improvements consistently translate to 16.3% and 34.3% average improvements in generation FID. By simply replacing the tokenizer in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) with TexTok, our system can achieve a 93.5x inference speedup while still outperforming the original DiT using only 32 tokens on ImageNet-512. TexTok with a vanilla DiT generator achieves state-of-the-art FID scores of 1.46 and 1.62 on ImageNet-256 and -512 respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate TexTok's superiority on the text-to-image generation task, effectively utilizing the off-the-shelf text captions in tokenization.</description>

Abstract: Our goal is to develop an AI Partner that can provide support for group problem solving and social dynamics. In multi-party working group environments, multimodal analytics is crucial for identifying non-verbal interactions of group members. In conjunction with their verbal participation, this creates an holistic understanding of collaboration and engagement that provides necessary context for the AI Partner. In this demo, we illustrate our present capabilities at detecting and tracking nonverbal behavior in student task-oriented interactions in the classroom, and the implications for tracking common ground and engagement.</description>

      <title>SILMM: Self-Improving Large Multimodal Models for Compositional Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in multimodal understanding and generation, pushing forward advancements in text-to-image generation. However, achieving accurate text-image alignment for LMMs, particularly in compositional scenarios, remains challenging. Existing approaches, such as layout planning for multi-step generation and learning from human feedback or AI feedback, depend heavily on prompt engineering, costly human annotations, and continual upgrading, limiting flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce a model-agnostic iterative self-improvement framework (SILMM) that can enable LMMs to provide helpful and scalable self-feedback and optimize text-image alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). DPO can readily applied to LMMs that use discrete visual tokens as intermediate image representations; while it is less suitable for LMMs with continuous visual features, as obtaining generation probabilities is challenging. To adapt SILMM to LMMs with continuous features, we propose a diversity mechanism to obtain diverse representations and a kernel-based continuous DPO for alignment. Extensive experiments on three compositional text-to-image generation benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of SILMM, showing improvements exceeding 30% on T2I-CompBench++ and around 20% on DPG-Bench.</description>

      <title>An Entailment Tree Generation Approach for Multimodal Multi-Hop Question Answering with Mixture-of-Experts and Iterative Feedback Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of large-scale language models (LLMs), it is currently popular and effective to convert multimodal information into text descriptions for multimodal multi-hop question answering. However, we argue that the current methods of multi-modal multi-hop question answering still mainly face two challenges: 1) The retrieved evidence containing a large amount of redundant information, inevitably leads to a significant drop in performance due to irrelevant information misleading the prediction. 2) The reasoning process without interpretable reasoning steps makes the model difficult to discover the logical errors for handling complex questions. To solve these problems, we propose a unified LLMs-based approach but without heavily relying on them due to the LLM's potential errors, and innovatively treat multimodal multi-hop question answering as a joint entailment tree generation and question answering problem. Specifically, we design a multi-task learning framework with a focus on facilitating common knowledge sharing across interpretability and prediction tasks while preventing task-specific errors from interfering with each other via mixture of experts. Afterward, we design an iterative feedback mechanism to further enhance both tasks by feeding back the results of the joint training to the LLM for regenerating entailment trees, aiming to iteratively refine the potential answer. Notably, our method has won the first place in the official leaderboard of WebQA (since April 10, 2024), and achieves competitive results on MultimodalQA.</description>

      <title>DapperFL: Domain Adaptive Federated Learning with Model Fusion Pruning for Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent machine learning paradigm in edge computing environments, enabling edge devices to collaboratively optimize a global model without sharing their private data. However, existing FL frameworks suffer from efficacy deterioration due to the system heterogeneity inherent in edge computing, especially in the presence of domain shifts across local data. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous FL framework DapperFL, to enhance model performance across multiple domains. In DapperFL, we introduce a dedicated Model Fusion Pruning (MFP) module to produce personalized compact local models for clients to address the system heterogeneity challenges. The MFP module prunes local models with fused knowledge obtained from both local and remaining domains, ensuring robustness to domain shifts. Additionally, we design a Domain Adaptive Regularization (DAR) module to further improve the overall performance of DapperFL. The DAR module employs regularization generated by the pruned model, aiming to learn robust representations across domains. Furthermore, we introduce a specific aggregation algorithm for aggregating heterogeneous local models with tailored architectures and weights. We implement DapperFL on a realworld FL platform with heterogeneous clients. Experimental results on benchmark datasets with multiple domains demonstrate that DapperFL outperforms several state-of-the-art FL frameworks by up to 2.28%, while significantly achieving model volume reductions ranging from 20% to 80%.

      <title>Large Language Models Merging for Enhancing the Link Stealing Attack on Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), specifically designed to process the graph data, have achieved remarkable success in various applications. Link stealing attacks on graph data pose a significant privacy threat, as attackers aim to extract sensitive relationships between nodes (entities), potentially leading to academic misconduct, fraudulent transactions, or other malicious activities. Previous studies have primarily focused on single datasets and did not explore cross-dataset attacks, let alone attacks that leverage the combined knowledge of multiple attackers. However, we find that an attacker can combine the data knowledge of multiple attackers to create a more effective attack model, which can be referred to cross-dataset attacks. Moreover, if knowledge can be extracted with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs), the attack capability will be more significant. In this paper, we propose a novel link stealing attack method that takes advantage of cross-dataset and Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM is applied to process datasets with different data structures in cross-dataset attacks. Each attacker fine-tunes the LLM on their specific dataset to generate a tailored attack model. We then introduce a novel model merging method to integrate the parameters of these attacker-specific models effectively. The result is a merged attack model with superior generalization capabilities, enabling effective attacks not only on the attackers' datasets but also on previously unseen (out-of-domain) datasets. We conducted extensive experiments in four datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Additional experiments with three different GNN and LLM architectures further illustrate the generality of our approach.</description>

      <title>DREAM: Domain-agnostic Reverse Engineering Attributes of Black-box Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models are usually black boxes when deployed on machine learning platforms. Prior works have shown that the attributes (e.g., the number of convolutional layers) of a target black-box model can be exposed through a sequence of queries. There is a crucial limitation: these works assume the training dataset of the target model is known beforehand and leverage this dataset for model attribute attack. However, it is difficult to access the training dataset of the target black-box model in reality. Therefore, whether the attributes of a target black-box model could be still revealed in this case is doubtful. In this paper, we investigate a new problem of black-box reverse engineering, without requiring the availability of the target model's training dataset. We put forward a general and principled framework DREAM, by casting this problem as out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. In this way, we can learn a domain-agnostic meta-model to infer the attributes of the target black-box model with unknown training data. This makes our method one of the kinds that can gracefully apply to an arbitrary domain for model attribute reverse engineering with strong generalization ability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over the baselines.</description>

      <title>Kernel Stochastic Configuration Networks for Nonlinear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic configuration networks (SCNs), as a class of randomized learner models, are featured by its way of random parameters assignment in the light of a supervisory mechanism, resulting in the universal approximation property at algorithmic level. This paper presents a kernel version of SCNs, termed KSCNs, aiming to enhance model's representation learning capability and performance stability. The random bases of a built SCN model can be used to span a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), followed by our proposed algorithm for constructing KSCNs. It is shown that the data distribution in the reconstructive space is favorable for regression solving and the proposed KSCN learner models hold the universal approximation property. Three benchmark datasets including two industrial datasets are used in this study for performance evaluation. Experimental results with comparisons against existing solutions clearly demonstrate that the proposed KSCN remarkably outperforms the original SCNs and some typical kernel methods for resolving nonlinear regression problems in terms of the learning performance, the model's stability and robustness with respect to the kernel parameter settings.</description>

      <title>Evolving Algebraic Multigrid Methods Using Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multigrid methods despite being known to be asymptotically optimal algorithms, depend on the careful selection of their individual components for efficiency. Also, they are mostly restricted to standard cycle types like V-, F-, and W-cycles. We use grammar rules to generate arbitrary-shaped cycles, wherein the smoothers and their relaxation weights are chosen independently at each step within the cycle. We call this a flexible multigrid cycle. These flexible cycles are used in Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) methods with the help of grammar rules and optimized using genetic programming. The flexible AMG methods are implemented in the software library of hypre, and the programs are optimized separately for two cases: a standalone AMG solver for a 3D anisotropic problem and an AMG preconditioner with conjugate gradient for a multiphysics code. We observe that the optimized flexible cycles provide higher efficiency and better performance than the standard cycle types.</description>

      <title>CardOOD: Robust Query-driven Cardinality Estimation under Out-of-Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Query-driven learned estimators are accurate, flexible, and lightweight alternatives to traditional estimators in query optimization. However, existing query-driven approaches struggle with the Out-of-distribution (OOD) problem, where the test workload distribution differs from the training workload, leading to performancedegradation. In this paper, we present CardOOD, a general learning framework designed to construct robust query-driven cardinality estimators that are resilient against the OOD problem. Our framework focuses on offline training algorithms that develop one-off models from a static workload, suitable for model initialization and periodic retraining. In CardOOD, we extend classical transfer/robust learning techniques to train query-driven cardinalityestimators, and the algorithms fall into three categories: representation learning, data manipulation, and new learning strategies. As these learning techniques are originally evaluated in computervision tasks, we also propose a new learning algorithm that exploits the property of cardinality estimation. This algorithm, lying in the category of new learning strategy, models the partial order constraint of cardinalities by a self-supervised learning task. Comprehensive experimental studies demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithms of CardOOD in mitigating the OOD problem to varying extents. We further integrate CardOOD into PostgreSQL, showcasing its practical utility in query optimization.</description>

      <title>Automated Extraction and Creation of FBS Design Reasoning Knowledge Graphs from Structured Data in Product Catalogues Lacking Contextual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ontology-based knowledge graphs (KG) are desirable for effective knowledge management and reuse in various decision making scenarios, including design. Creating and populating extensive KG based on specific ontological models can be highly labour and time-intensive unless automated processes are developed for knowledge extraction and graph creation. Most research and development on automated extraction and creation of KG is based on extensive unstructured data sets that provide contextual information. However, some of the most useful information about the products and services of a company has traditionally been recorded as structured data. Such structured data sets rarely follow a standard ontology, do not capture explicit mapping of relationships between the entities, and provide no contextual information. Therefore, this research reports a method and digital workflow developed to address this gap. The developed method and workflow employ rule-based techniques to extract and create a Function Behaviour-Structure (FBS) ontology-based KG from legacy structured data, especially specification sheets and product catalogues. The solution approach consists of two main components: a process for deriving context and context-based classification rules for FBS ontology concepts and a workflow for populating and retrieving the FBS ontology-based KG. KG and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are used to automate knowledge extraction, representation, and retrieval. The workflow's effectiveness is demonstrated via pilot implementation in an industrial context. Insights gained from the pilot study are reported regarding the challenges and opportunities, including discussing the FBS ontology and concepts.</description>

      <title>MG-3D: Multi-Grained Knowledge-Enhanced 3D Medical Vision-Language Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D medical image analysis is pivotal in numerous clinical applications. However, the scarcity of labeled data and limited generalization capabilities hinder the advancement of AI-empowered models. Radiology reports are easily accessible and can serve as weakly-supervised signals. However, large-scale vision-language pre-training (VLP) remains underexplored in 3D medical image analysis. Specifically, the insufficient investigation into multi-grained radiology semantics and their correlations across patients leads to underutilization of large-scale volume-report data.
  Considering intra-patient cross-modal semantic consistency and inter-patient semantic correlations, we propose a multi-task VLP method, MG-3D, pre-trained on large-scale data (47.1K), addressing the challenges by the following two aspects: 1) Establishing the correspondence between volume semantics and multi-grained medical knowledge of each patient with cross-modal global alignment and complementary modality-guided local reconstruction, ensuring intra-patient features of different modalities cohesively represent the same semantic content; 2) Correlating inter-patient visual semantics based on fine-grained report correlations across patients, and keeping sensitivity to global individual differences via contrastive learning, enhancing the discriminative feature representation. Furthermore, we delve into the scaling law to explore potential performance improvements. Comprehensive evaluations across nine uni- and cross-modal clinical tasks are carried out to assess model efficacy. Extensive experiments on both internal and external datasets demonstrate the superior transferability, scalability, and generalization of MG-3D, showcasing its potential in advancing feature representation for 3D medical image analysis. Code will be available: https://github.com/Xuefeng-Ni/MG-3D.</description>

      <title>3D-Consistent Image Inpainting with Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of 3D inconsistency of image inpainting based on diffusion models. We propose a generative model using image pairs that belong to the same scene. To achieve the 3D-consistent and semantically coherent inpainting, we modify the generative diffusion model by incorporating an alternative point of view of the scene into the denoising process. This creates an inductive bias that allows to recover 3D priors while training to denoise in 2D, without explicit 3D supervision. Training unconditional diffusion models with additional images as in-context guidance allows to harmonize the masked and non-masked regions while repainting and ensures the 3D consistency. We evaluate our method on one synthetic and three real-world datasets and show that it generates semantically coherent and 3D-consistent inpaintings and outperforms the state-of-art methods.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the effect of uncertainty and noise in data on machine learning models (MLM) is crucial in developing trust and measuring performance. In this paper, a new model is proposed to quantify uncertainties and noise in data on MLMs. Using the concept of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a new metric called deterministic-non-deterministic ratio (DDR) is proposed to formulate performance of a model. Using synthetic data in experiments, we show how accuracy can change with DDR and how we can use DDR-accuracy curves to determine performance of a model.</description>

      <title>BAMBA: A Bimodal Adversarial Multi-Round Black-Box Jailbreak Attacker for LVLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LVLMs are widely used but vulnerable to illegal or unethical responses under jailbreak attacks. To ensure their responsible deployment in real-world applications, it is essential to understand their vulnerabilities. There are four main issues in current work: single-round attack limitation, insufficient dual-modal synergy, poor transferability to black-box models, and reliance on prompt engineering. To address these limitations, we propose BAMBA, a bimodal adversarial multi-round black-box jailbreak attacker for LVLMs. We first use an image optimizer to learn malicious features from a harmful corpus, then deepen these features through a bimodal optimizer through text-image interaction, generating adversarial text and image for jailbreak. Experiments on various LVLMs and datasets demonstrate that BAMBA outperforms other baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-interactive robotic systems, particularly autonomous vehicles (AVs), must effectively integrate human instructions into their motion planning. This paper introduces doScenes, a novel dataset designed to facilitate research on human-vehicle instruction interactions, focusing on short-term directives that directly influence vehicle motion. By annotating multimodal sensor data with natural language instructions and referentiality tags, doScenes bridges the gap between instruction and driving response, enabling context-aware and adaptive planning. Unlike existing datasets that focus on ranking or scene-level reasoning, doScenes emphasizes actionable directives tied to static and dynamic scene objects. This framework addresses limitations in prior research, such as reliance on simulated data or predefined action sets, by supporting nuanced and flexible responses in real-world scenarios. This work lays the foundation for developing learning strategies that seamlessly integrate human instructions into autonomous systems, advancing safe and effective human-vehicle collaboration for vision-language navigation.

      <title>Detecting Discrepancies Between AI-Generated and Natural Images Using Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel approach for detecting AI-generated images by leveraging predictive uncertainty to mitigate misuse and associated risks. The motivation arises from the fundamental assumption regarding the distributional discrepancy between natural and AI-generated images. The feasibility of distinguishing natural images from AI-generated ones is grounded in the distribution discrepancy between them. Predictive uncertainty offers an effective approach for capturing distribution shifts, thereby providing insights into detecting AI-generated images. Namely, as the distribution shift between training and testing data increases, model performance typically degrades, often accompanied by increased predictive uncertainty. Therefore, we propose to employ predictive uncertainty to reflect the discrepancies between AI-generated and natural images. In this context, the challenge lies in ensuring that the model has been trained over sufficient natural images to avoid the risk of determining the distribution of natural images as that of generated images. We propose to leverage large-scale pre-trained models to calculate the uncertainty as the score for detecting AI-generated images. This leads to a simple yet effective method for detecting AI-generated images using large-scale vision models: images that induce high uncertainty are identified as AI-generated. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Heuristic-Induced Multimodal Risk Distribution Jailbreak Attack for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), concerns regarding their security have increasingly captured the attention of both academia and industry. Although MLLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, designing effective multimodal jailbreak attacks poses unique challenges, especially given the distinct protective measures implemented across various modalities in commercial models. Previous works concentrate risks into a single modality, resulting in limited jailbreak performance. In this paper, we propose a heuristic-induced multimodal risk distribution jailbreak attack method, called HIMRD, which consists of two elements: multimodal risk distribution strategy and heuristic-induced search strategy. The multimodal risk distribution strategy is used to segment harmful instructions across multiple modalities to effectively circumvent MLLMs' security protection. The heuristic-induced search strategy identifies two types of prompts: the understanding-enhancing prompt, which helps the MLLM reconstruct the malicious prompt, and the inducing prompt, which increases the likelihood of affirmative outputs over refusals, enabling a successful jailbreak attack. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach effectively uncovers vulnerabilities in MLLMs, achieving an average attack success rate of 90% across seven popular open-source MLLMs and an average attack success rate of around 68% in three popular closed-source MLLMs. Our code will coming soon.

      <title>Accelerating Manufacturing Scale-Up from Material Discovery Using Agentic Web Navigation and Retrieval-Augmented AI for Process Engineering Schematics Design</title>

Abstract: Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) and Process and Instrumentation Diagrams (PIDs) are critical tools for industrial process design, control, and safety. However, the generation of precise and regulation-compliant diagrams remains a significant challenge, particularly in scaling breakthroughs from material discovery to industrial production in an era of automation and digitalization. This paper introduces an autonomous agentic framework to address these challenges through a twostage approach involving knowledge acquisition and generation. The framework integrates specialized sub-agents for retrieving and synthesizing multimodal data from publicly available online sources and constructs ontological knowledge graphs using a Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) paradigm. These capabilities enable the automation of diagram generation and open-domain question answering (ODQA) tasks with high contextual accuracy. Extensive empirical experiments demonstrate the frameworks ability to deliver regulation-compliant diagrams with minimal expert intervention, highlighting its practical utility for industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Materials-Discovery Workflows Guided by Symbolic Regression: Identifying Acid-Stable Oxides for Electrocatalysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficiency of active learning (AL) approaches to identify materials with desired properties relies on the knowledge of a few parameters describing the property. However, these parameters are unknown if the property is governed by a high intricacy of many atomistic processes. Here, we develop an AL workflow based on the sure-independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) symbolic-regression approach. SISSO identifies the few, key parameters correlated with a given materials property via analytical expressions, out of many offered primary features. Crucially, we train ensembles of SISSO models in order to quantify mean predictions and their uncertainty, enabling the use of SISSO in AL. By combining bootstrap sampling to obtain training datasets with Monte-Carlo feature dropout, the high prediction errors observed by a single SISSO model are improved. Besides, the feature dropout procedure alleviates the overconfidence issues observed in the widely used bagging approach. We demonstrate the SISSO-guided AL workflow by identifying acid-stable oxides for water splitting using high-quality DFT-HSE06 calculations. From a pool of 1470 materials, 12 acid-stable materials are identified in only 30 AL iterations. The materials property maps provided by SISSO along with the uncertainty estimates reduce the risk of missing promising portions of the materials space that were overlooked in the initial, possibly biased dataset.</description>

      <title>Language hooks: a modular framework for augmenting LLM reasoning that decouples tool usage from the model and its prompt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prompting and fine-tuning have emerged as two competing paradigms for augmenting language models with new capabilities, such as the use of tools. Prompting approaches are quick to set up but rely on providing explicit demonstrations of each tool's usage in the model's prompt, thus coupling tool use to the task at hand and limiting generalisation. Fine-tuning removes the need for task-specific demonstrations of tool usage at runtime; however, this ties new capabilities to a single model, thus making already-heavier setup costs a recurring expense. In this paper, we introduce language hooks, a novel framework for augmenting language models with new capabilities that is decoupled both from the model's task-specific prompt and from the model itself. The language hook algorithm interleaves text generation by the base model with the execution of modular programs that trigger conditionally based on the existing text and the available capabilities. Upon triggering, programs may call external tools, auxiliary language models (e.g. using tool specific prompts), and modify the existing context. We benchmark our method against state-of-the-art baselines, find that it outperforms task-aware approaches, and demonstrate its ability to generalise to novel tasks.</description>

      <title>LVS-Net: A Lightweight Vessels Segmentation Network for Retinal Image Analysis</title>

Abstract: The analysis of retinal images for the diagnosis of various diseases is one of the emerging areas of research. Recently, the research direction has been inclined towards investigating several changes in retinal blood vessels in subjects with many neurological disorders, including dementia. This research focuses on detecting diseases early by improving the performance of models for segmentation of retinal vessels with fewer parameters, which reduces computational costs and supports faster processing. This paper presents a novel lightweight encoder-decoder model that segments retinal vessels to improve the efficiency of disease detection. It incorporates multi-scale convolutional blocks in the encoder to accurately identify vessels of various sizes and thicknesses. The bottleneck of the model integrates the Focal Modulation Attention and Spatial Feature Refinement Blocks to refine and enhance essential features for efficient segmentation. The decoder upsamples features and integrates them with the corresponding feature in the encoder using skip connections and the spatial feature refinement block at every upsampling stage to enhance feature representation at various scales. The estimated computation complexity of our proposed model is around 29.60 GFLOP with 0.71 million parameters and 2.74 MB of memory size, and it is evaluated using public datasets, that is, DRIVE, CHASE\_DB, and STARE. It outperforms existing models with dice scores of 86.44\%, 84.22\%, and 87.88\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>PIG: Physics-Informed Gaussians as Adaptive Parametric Mesh Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The approximation of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using neural networks has seen significant advancements through Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Despite their straightforward optimization framework and flexibility in implementing various PDEs, PINNs often suffer from limited accuracy due to the spectral bias of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), which struggle to effectively learn high-frequency and non-linear components. Recently, parametric mesh representations in combination with neural networks have been investigated as a promising approach to eliminate the inductive biases of neural networks. However, they usually require very high-resolution grids and a large number of collocation points to achieve high accuracy while avoiding overfitting issues. In addition, the fixed positions of the mesh parameters restrict their flexibility, making it challenging to accurately approximate complex PDEs. To overcome these limitations, we propose Physics-Informed Gaussians (PIGs), which combine feature embeddings using Gaussian functions with a lightweight neural network. Our approach uses trainable parameters for the mean and variance of each Gaussian, allowing for dynamic adjustment of their positions and shapes during training. This adaptability enables our model to optimally approximate PDE solutions, unlike models with fixed parameter positions. Furthermore, the proposed approach maintains the same optimization framework used in PINNs, allowing us to benefit from their excellent properties. Experimental results show the competitive performance of our model across various PDEs, demonstrating its potential as a robust tool for solving complex PDEs.

      <title>Track4Gen: Teaching Video Diffusion Models to Track Points Improves Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While recent foundational video generators produce visually rich output, they still struggle with appearance drift, where objects gradually degrade or change inconsistently across frames, breaking visual coherence. We hypothesize that this is because there is no explicit supervision in terms of spatial tracking at the feature level. We propose Track4Gen, a spatially aware video generator that combines video diffusion loss with point tracking across frames, providing enhanced spatial supervision on the diffusion features. Track4Gen merges the video generation and point tracking tasks into a single network by making minimal changes to existing video generation architectures. Using Stable Video Diffusion as a backbone, Track4Gen demonstrates that it is possible to unify video generation and point tracking, which are typically handled as separate tasks. Our extensive evaluations show that Track4Gen effectively reduces appearance drift, resulting in temporally stable and visually coherent video generation.

      <title>Imputation Matters: A Deeper Look into an Overlooked Step in Longitudinal Health and Behavior Sensing Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Longitudinal passive sensing studies for health and behavior outcomes often have missing and incomplete data. Handling missing data effectively is thus a critical data processing and modeling step. Our formative interviews with researchers working in longitudinal health and behavior passive sensing revealed a recurring theme: most researchers consider imputation a low-priority step in their analysis and inference pipeline, opting to use simple and off-the-shelf imputation strategies without comprehensively evaluating its impact on study outcomes. Through this paper, we call attention to the importance of imputation. Using publicly available passive sensing datasets for depression, we show that prioritizing imputation can significantly impact the study outcomes -- with our proposed imputation strategies resulting in up to 31% improvement in AUROC to predict depression over the original imputation strategy. We conclude by discussing the challenges and opportunities with effective imputation in longitudinal sensing studies.</description>

      <title>Can Generative AI Solve Your In-Context Learning Problem? A Martingale Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is about estimating when a conditional generative model (CGM) can solve an in-context learning (ICL) problem. An in-context learning (ICL) problem comprises a CGM, a dataset, and a prediction task. The CGM could be a multi-modal foundation model; the dataset, a collection of patient histories, test results, and recorded diagnoses; and the prediction task to communicate a diagnosis to a new patient. A Bayesian interpretation of ICL assumes that the CGM computes a posterior predictive distribution over an unknown Bayesian model defining a joint distribution over latent explanations and observable data. From this perspective, Bayesian model criticism is a reasonable approach to assess the suitability of a given CGM for an ICL problem. However, such approaches -- like posterior predictive checks (PPCs) -- often assume that we can sample from the likelihood and posterior defined by the Bayesian model, which are not explicitly given for contemporary CGMs. To address this, we show when ancestral sampling from the predictive distribution of a CGM is equivalent to sampling datasets from the posterior predictive of the assumed Bayesian model. Then we develop the generative predictive $p$-value, which enables PPCs and their cousins for contemporary CGMs. The generative predictive $p$-value can then be used in a statistical decision procedure to determine when the model is appropriate for an ICL problem. Our method only requires generating queries and responses from a CGM and evaluating its response log probability. We empirically evaluate our method on synthetic tabular, imaging, and natural language ICL tasks using large language models.</description>

Abstract: Generative AI is transforming enterprise application development by enabling machines to create content, code, and designs. These models, however, demand substantial computational power and data management. Cloud computing addresses these needs by offering infrastructure to train, deploy, and scale generative AI models. This review examines cloud services for generative AI, focusing on key providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud. It compares their strengths, weaknesses, and impact on enterprise growth. We explore the role of high-performance computing (HPC), serverless architectures, edge computing, and storage in supporting generative AI. We also highlight the significance of data management, networking, and AI-specific tools in building and deploying these models. Additionally, the review addresses security concerns, including data privacy, compliance, and AI model protection. It assesses the performance and cost efficiency of various cloud providers and presents case studies from healthcare, finance, and entertainment. We conclude by discussing challenges and future directions, such as technical hurdles, vendor lock-in, sustainability, and regulatory issues. Put together, this work can serve as a guide for practitioners and researchers looking to adopt cloud-based generative AI solutions, serving as a valuable guide to navigating the intricacies of this evolving field.</description>

Abstract: Although capable of generating creative text, Large Language Models (LLMs) are poor judges of what constitutes "creativity". In this work, we show that we can leverage this knowledge of how to write creatively in order to better judge what is creative. We take a mechanistic approach that extracts differences in the internal states of an LLM when prompted to respond "boringly" or "creatively" to provide a robust measure of creativity that corresponds strongly with human judgment. We also show these internal state differences can be applied to enhance the creativity of generated text at inference time.</description>

      <title>Curse of Attention: A Kernel-Based Perspective for Why Transformers Fail to Generalize on Time Series Forecasting and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of transformer-based models on time series forecasting (TSF) tasks has long been popular to study. However, many of these works fail to beat the simple linear residual model, and the theoretical understanding of this issue is still limited. In this work, we propose the first theoretical explanation of the inefficiency of transformers on TSF tasks. We attribute the mechanism behind it to {\bf Asymmetric Learning} in training attention networks. When the sign of the previous step is inconsistent with the sign of the current step in the next-step-prediction time series, attention fails to learn the residual features. This makes it difficult to generalize on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, especially on the sign-inconsistent next-step-prediction data, with the same representation pattern, whereas a linear residual network could easily accomplish it. We hope our theoretical insights provide important necessary conditions for designing the expressive and efficient transformer-based architecture for practitioners.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Norm-Explicit Product Quantization for Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the data resources grow, providing recommendations that best meet the demands has become a vital requirement in business and life to overcome the information overload problem. However, building a system suggesting relevant recommendations has always been a point of debate. One of the most cost-efficient techniques in terms of producing relevant recommendations at a low complexity is Product Quantization (PQ). PQ approaches have continued developing in recent years. This system's crucial challenge is improving product quantization performance in terms of recall measures without compromising its complexity. This makes the algorithm suitable for problems that require a greater number of potentially relevant items without disregarding others, at high-speed and low-cost to keep up with traffic. This is the case of online shops where the recommendations for the purpose are important, although customers can be susceptible to scoping other products. This research proposes a fuzzy approach to perform norm-based product quantization. Type-2 Fuzzy sets (T2FSs) define the codebook allowing sub-vectors (T2FSs) to be associated with more than one element of the codebook, and next, its norm calculus is resolved by means of integration. Our method finesses the recall measure up, making the algorithm suitable for problems that require querying at most possible potential relevant items without disregarding others. The proposed method outperforms all PQ approaches such as NEQ, PQ, and RQ up to +6%, +5%, and +8% by achieving a recall of 94%, 69%, 59% in Netflix, Audio, Cifar60k datasets, respectively. More and over, computing time and complexity nearly equals the most computationally efficient existing PQ method in the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>KaSA: Knowledge-Aware Singular-Value Adaptation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing sizes of large language models (LLMs) result in significant computational overhead and memory usage when adapting these models to specific tasks or domains. Various parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been devised to mitigate these challenges by training a small set of parameters for the task-specific updates of the model weights. Among PEFT methods, LoRA stands out for its simplicity and efficiency, inspiring the development of a series of variants. However, LoRA and its successors disregard the knowledge that is noisy or irrelevant to the targeted task, detrimentally impacting model performance and leading to suboptimality. To address this limitation, we introduce Knowledge-aware Singular-value Adaptation (KaSA), a PEFT method that leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) with knowledge-aware singular values to dynamically activate knowledge based on its relevance to the task at hand. We conduct extensive experiments across a range of LLMs on tasks spanning natural language understanding (NLU), generation (NLG), instruction following, and commonsense reasoning. The experimental results demonstrate that KaSA consistently outperforms FFT and 14 popular PEFT baselines across 16 benchmarks and 4 synthetic datasets, underscoring our method's efficacy and adaptability. The source code of our method is available at https://github.com/juyongjiang/KaSA.</description>

      <title>GVDepth: Zero-Shot Monocular Depth Estimation for Ground Vehicles based on Probabilistic Cue Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizing metric monocular depth estimation presents a significant challenge due to its ill-posed nature, while the entanglement between camera parameters and depth amplifies issues further, hindering multi-dataset training and zero-shot accuracy. This challenge is particularly evident in autonomous vehicles and mobile robotics, where data is collected with fixed camera setups, limiting the geometric diversity. Yet, this context also presents an opportunity: the fixed relationship between the camera and the ground plane imposes additional perspective geometry constraints, enabling depth regression via vertical image positions of objects. However, this cue is highly susceptible to overfitting, thus we propose a novel canonical representation that maintains consistency across varied camera setups, effectively disentangling depth from specific parameters and enhancing generalization across datasets. We also propose a novel architecture that adaptively and probabilistically fuses depths estimated via object size and vertical image position cues. A comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach on five autonomous driving datasets, achieving accurate metric depth estimation for varying resolutions, aspect ratios and camera setups. Notably, we achieve comparable accuracy to existing zero-shot methods, despite training on a single dataset with a single-camera setup.</description>

      <title>Ethnography and Machine Learning: Synergies and New Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ethnography (social scientific methods that illuminate how people understand, navigate and shape the real world contexts in which they live their lives) and machine learning (computational techniques that use big data and statistical learning models to perform quantifiable tasks) are each core to contemporary social science. Yet these tools have remained largely separate in practice. This chapter draws on a growing body of scholarship that argues that ethnography and machine learning can be usefully combined, particularly for large comparative studies. Specifically, this paper (a) explains the value (and challenges) of using machine learning alongside qualitative field research for certain types of projects, (b) discusses recent methodological trends to this effect, (c) provides examples that illustrate workflow drawn from several large projects, and (d) concludes with a roadmap for enabling productive coevolution of field methods and machine learning.</description>

      <title>A4-Unet: Deformable Multi-Scale Attention Network for Brain Tumor Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation models have aided diagnosis in recent years. However, they face MRI complexity and variability challenges, including irregular shapes and unclear boundaries, leading to noise, misclassification, and incomplete segmentation, thereby limiting accuracy. To address these issues, we adhere to an outstanding Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) design paradigm and propose a novel network named A4-Unet. In A4-Unet, Deformable Large Kernel Attention (DLKA) is incorporated in the encoder, allowing for improved capture of multi-scale tumors. Swin Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SSPP) with cross-channel attention is employed in a bottleneck further to study long-distance dependencies within images and channel relationships. To enhance accuracy, a Combined Attention Module (CAM) with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) orthogonality for channel weighting and convolutional element-wise multiplication is introduced for spatial weighting in the decoder. Attention gates (AG) are added in the skip connection to highlight the foreground while suppressing irrelevant background information. The proposed network is evaluated on three authoritative MRI brain tumor benchmarks and a proprietary dataset, and it achieves a 94.4% Dice score on the BraTS 2020 dataset, thereby establishing multiple new state-of-the-art benchmarks. The code is available here: https://github.com/WendyWAAAAANG/A4-Unet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CIA security triad - Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability - is a cornerstone of data and cybersecurity. With the emergence of large language model (LLM) applications, a new class of threat, known as prompt injection, was first identified in 2022. Since then, numerous real-world vulnerabilities and exploits have been documented in production LLM systems, including those from leading vendors like OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic and Google. This paper compiles real-world exploits and proof-of concept examples, based on the research conducted and publicly documented by the author, demonstrating how prompt injection undermines the CIA triad and poses ongoing risks to cybersecurity and AI systems at large.</description>

      <title>Order Theory in the Context of Machine Learning: an application</title>

Abstract: The paper ``Tropical Geometry of Deep Neural Networks'' by L. Zhang et al. introduces an equivalence between integer-valued neural networks (IVNN) with activation $\text{ReLU}_{t}$ and tropical rational functions, which come with a map to polytopes. Here, IVNN refers to a network with integer weights but real biases, and $\text{ReLU}_{t}$ is defined as $\text{ReLU}_{t}(x)=\max(x,t)$ for $t\in\mathbb{R}\cup\{-\infty\}$.
  For every poset with $n$ points, there exists a corresponding order polytope, i.e., a convex polytope in the unit cube $[0,1]^n$ whose coordinates obey the inequalities of the poset. We study neural networks whose associated polytope is an order polytope. We then explain how posets with four points induce neural networks that can be interpreted as $2\times 2$ convolutional filters. These poset filters can be added to any neural network, not only IVNN.
  Similarly to maxout, poset convolutional filters update the weights of the neural network during backpropagation with more precision than average pooling, max pooling, or mixed pooling, without the need to train extra parameters. We report experiments that support our statements.
  We also prove that the assignment from a poset to an order polytope (and to certain tropical polynomials) is one to one, and we define the structure of algebra over the operad of posets on tropical polynomials.</description>

      <title>DECO: Life-Cycle Management of Enterprise-Grade Chatbots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software engineers frequently grapple with the challenge of accessing disparate documentation and telemetry data, including Troubleshooting Guides (TSGs), incident reports, code repositories, and various internal tools developed by multiple stakeholders. While on-call duties are inevitable, incident resolution becomes even more daunting due to the obscurity of legacy sources and the pressures of strict time constraints. To enhance the efficiency of on-call engineers (OCEs) and streamline their daily workflows, we introduced DECO -- a comprehensive framework for developing, deploying, and managing enterprise-grade chatbots tailored to improve productivity in engineering routines. This paper details the design and implementation of the DECO framework, emphasizing its innovative NL2SearchQuery functionality and a hierarchical planner. These features support efficient and customized retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) algorithms that not only extract relevant information from diverse sources but also select the most pertinent toolkits in response to user queries. This enables the addressing of complex technical questions and provides seamless, automated access to internal resources. Additionally, DECO incorporates a robust mechanism for converting unstructured incident logs into user-friendly, structured guides, effectively bridging the documentation gap. Feedback from users underscores DECO's pivotal role in simplifying complex engineering tasks, accelerating incident resolution, and bolstering organizational productivity. Since its launch in September 2023, DECO has demonstrated its effectiveness through extensive engagement, with tens of thousands of interactions from hundreds of active users across multiple organizations within the company.</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing, enabling applications in diverse domains such as healthcare, finance and education. However, the growing reliance on extensive data for training and inference has raised significant privacy concerns, ranging from data leakage to adversarial attacks. This survey comprehensively explores the landscape of privacy-preserving mechanisms tailored for LLMs, including differential privacy, federated learning, cryptographic protocols, and trusted execution environments. We examine their efficacy in addressing key privacy challenges, such as membership inference and model inversion attacks, while balancing trade-offs between privacy and model utility. Furthermore, we analyze privacy-preserving applications of LLMs in privacy-sensitive domains, highlighting successful implementations and inherent limitations. Finally, this survey identifies emerging research directions, emphasizing the need for novel frameworks that integrate privacy by design into the lifecycle of LLMs. By synthesizing state-of-the-art approaches and future trends, this paper provides a foundation for developing robust, privacy-preserving large language models that safeguard sensitive information without compromising performance.</description>

      <title>MMedPO: Aligning Medical Vision-Language Models with Clinical-Aware Multimodal Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has propelled their application in the medical field. However, Medical LVLMs (Med-LVLMs) encounter factuality challenges due to modality misalignment, where the models prioritize textual knowledge over visual input, leading to hallucinations that contradict information in medical images. Previous attempts to enhance modality alignment in Med-LVLMs through preference optimization have inadequately mitigated clinical relevance in preference data, making these samples easily distinguishable and reducing alignment effectiveness. To address this challenge, we propose MMedPO, a novel multimodal medical preference optimization approach that considers the clinical relevance of preference samples to enhance Med-LVLM alignment. MMedPO curates multimodal preference data by introducing two types of dispreference: (1) plausible hallucinations injected through target Med-LVLMs or GPT-4o to produce medically inaccurate responses, and (2) lesion region neglect achieved through local lesion-noising, disrupting visual understanding of critical areas. We then calculate clinical relevance for each sample based on scores from multiple Med-LLMs and visual tools, and integrate these scores into the preference optimization process as weights, enabling effective alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that MMedPO significantly enhances factual accuracy in Med-LVLMs, achieving substantial improvements over existing preference optimization methods by averaging 14.2% and 51.7% across the Med-VQA and report generation tasks. Our code are available in https://github.com/aiming-lab/MMedPO.</description>

      <title>Precise, Fast, and Low-cost Concept Erasure in Value Space: Orthogonal Complement Matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of text-to-image generation enabled by diffuion models has imposed an urgent need to erase unwanted concepts, e.g., copyrighted, offensive, and unsafe ones, from the pre-trained models in a precise, timely, and low-cost manner. The twofold demand of concept erasure requires a precise removal of the target concept during generation (i.e., erasure efficacy), while a minimal impact on non-target content generation (i.e., prior preservation). Existing methods are either computationally costly or face challenges in maintaining an effective balance between erasure efficacy and prior preservation. To improve, we propose a precise, fast, and low-cost concept erasure method, called Adaptive Vaule Decomposer (AdaVD), which is training-free. This method is grounded in a classical linear algebraic orthogonal complement operation, implemented in the value space of each cross-attention layer within the UNet of diffusion models. An effective shift factor is designed to adaptively navigate the erasure strength, enhancing prior preservation without sacrificing erasure efficacy. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed AdaVD is effective at both single and multiple concept erasure, showing a 2- to 10-fold improvement in prior preservation as compared to the second best, meanwhile achieving the best or near best erasure efficacy, when comparing with both training-based and training-free state of the arts. AdaVD supports a series of diffusion models and downstream image generation tasks, the code is available on the project page: https://github.com/WYuan1001/AdaVD</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Dynamics Space for Heterogeneous Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyses of human motion kinematics have achieved tremendous advances. However, the production mechanism, known as human dynamics, is still undercovered. In this paper, we aim to push data-driven human dynamics understanding forward. We identify a major obstacle to this as the heterogeneity of existing human motion understanding efforts. Specifically, heterogeneity exists in not only the diverse kinematics representations and hierarchical dynamics representations but also in the data from different domains, namely biomechanics and reinforcement learning. With an in-depth analysis of the existing heterogeneity, we propose to emphasize the beneath homogeneity: all of them represent the homogeneous fact of human motion, though from different perspectives. Given this, we propose Homogeneous Dynamics Space (HDyS) as a fundamental space for human dynamics by aggregating heterogeneous data and training a homogeneous latent space with inspiration from the inverse-forward dynamics procedure. Leveraging the heterogeneous representations and datasets, HDyS achieves decent mapping between human kinematics and dynamics. We demonstrate the feasibility of HDyS with extensive experiments and applications. The project page is https://foruck.github.io/HDyS.</description>

      <title>The Computational Limits of State-Space Models and Mamba via the Lens of Circuit Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the computational limitations of Mamba and State-space Models (SSMs) by using the circuit complexity framework. Despite Mamba's stateful design and recent attention as a strong candidate to outperform Transformers, we have demonstrated that both Mamba and SSMs with $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-precision and constant-depth layers reside within the $\mathsf{DLOGTIME}$-uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ complexity class. This result indicates Mamba has the same computational capabilities as Transformer theoretically, and it cannot solve problems like arithmetic formula problems, boolean formula value problems, and permutation composition problems if $\mathsf{TC}^0 \neq \mathsf{NC}^1$. Therefore, it challenges the assumption Mamba is more computationally expressive than Transformers. Our contributions include rigorous proofs showing that Selective SSM and Mamba architectures can be simulated by $\mathsf{DLOGTIME}$-uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ circuits, and they cannot solve problems outside $\mathsf{TC}^0$.</description>

      <title>MoSH: Modeling Multi-Objective Tradeoffs with Soft and Hard Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Countless science and engineering applications in multi-objective optimization (MOO) necessitate that decision-makers (DMs) select a Pareto-optimal solution which aligns with their preferences. Evaluating individual solutions is often expensive, necessitating cost-sensitive optimization techniques. Due to competing objectives, the space of trade-offs is also expansive -- thus, examining the full Pareto frontier may prove overwhelming to a DM. Such real-world settings generally have loosely-defined and context-specific desirable regions for each objective function that can aid in constraining the search over the Pareto frontier. We introduce a novel conceptual framework that operationalizes these priors using soft-hard functions, SHFs, which allow for the DM to intuitively impose soft and hard bounds on each objective -- which has been lacking in previous MOO frameworks. Leveraging a novel minimax formulation for Pareto frontier sampling, we propose a two-step process for obtaining a compact set of Pareto-optimal points which respect the user-defined soft and hard bounds: (1) densely sample the Pareto frontier using Bayesian optimization, and (2) sparsify the selected set to surface to the user, using robust submodular function optimization. We prove that (2) obtains the optimal compact Pareto-optimal set of points from (1). We further show that many practical problems fit within the SHF framework and provide extensive empirical validation on diverse domains, including brachytherapy, engineering design, and large language model personalization. Specifically, for brachytherapy, our approach returns a compact set of points with over 3% greater SHF-defined utility than the next best approach. Among the other diverse experiments, our approach consistently leads in utility, allowing the DM to reach &gt;99% of their maximum possible desired utility within validation of 5 points.</description>

      <title>Conservative Contextual Bandits: Beyond Linear Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conservative Contextual Bandits (CCBs) address safety in sequential decision making by requiring that an agent's policy, along with minimizing regret, also satisfies a safety constraint: the performance is not worse than a baseline policy (e.g., the policy that the company has in production) by more than $(1+\alpha)$ factor. Prior work developed UCB-style algorithms in the multi-armed [Wu et al., 2016] and contextual linear [Kazerouni et al., 2017] settings. However, in practice the cost of the arms is often a non-linear function, and therefore existing UCB algorithms are ineffective in such settings. In this paper, we consider CCBs beyond the linear case and develop two algorithms $\mathtt{C-SquareCB}$ and $\mathtt{C-FastCB}$, using Inverse Gap Weighting (IGW) based exploration and an online regression oracle. We show that the safety constraint is satisfied with high probability and that the regret of $\mathtt{C-SquareCB}$ is sub-linear in horizon $T$, while the regret of $\mathtt{C-FastCB}$ is first-order and is sub-linear in $L^*$, the cumulative loss of the optimal policy. Subsequently, we use a neural network for function approximation and online gradient descent as the regression oracle to provide $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{KT} + K/\alpha) $ and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{KL^*} + K (1 + 1/\alpha))$ regret bounds, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms on real-world data and show that they significantly outperform the existing baseline while maintaining the performance guarantee.</description>

      <title>AlphaVerus: Bootstrapping Formally Verified Code Generation through Self-Improving Translation and Treefinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated code generation with large language models has gained significant traction, but there remains no guarantee on the correctness of generated code. We aim to use formal verification to provide mathematical guarantees that the generated code is correct. However, generating formally verified code with LLMs is hindered by the scarcity of training data and the complexity of formal proofs. To tackle this challenge, we introduce AlphaVerus, a self-improving framework that bootstraps formally verified code generation by iteratively translating programs from a higher-resource language and leveraging feedback from a verifier. AlphaVerus operates in three phases: exploration of candidate translations, Treefinement -- a novel tree search algorithm for program refinement using verifier feedback, and filtering misaligned specifications and programs to prevent reward hacking. Through this iterative process, AlphaVerus enables a LLaMA-3.1-70B model to generate verified code without human intervention or model finetuning. AlphaVerus shows an ability to generate formally verified solutions for HumanEval and MBPP, laying the groundwork for truly trustworthy code-generation agents.</description>

Abstract: This research builds upon the Latvian Twitter Eater Corpus (LTEC), which is focused on the narrow domain of tweets related to food, drinks, eating and drinking. LTEC has been collected for more than 12 years and reaching almost 3 million tweets with the basic information as well as extended automatically and manually annotated metadata. In this paper we supplement the LTEC with manually annotated subsets of evaluation data for machine translation, named entity recognition, timeline-balanced sentiment analysis, and text-image relation classification. We experiment with each of the data sets using baseline models and highlight future challenges for various modelling approaches.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Adversarial Resistance in LLMs with Recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into society necessitates robust defenses against vulnerabilities from jailbreaking and adversarial prompts. This project proposes a recursive framework for enhancing the resistance of LLMs to manipulation through the use of prompt simplification techniques. By increasing the transparency of complex and confusing adversarial prompts, the proposed method enables more reliable detection and prevention of malicious inputs. Our findings attempt to address a critical problem in AI safety and security, providing a foundation for the development of systems able to distinguish harmless inputs from prompts containing malicious intent. As LLMs continue to be used in diverse applications, the importance of such safeguards will only grow.</description>

      <title>Skill-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning Acceleration from Demonstrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) aims to facilitate rapid Reinforcement Learning (RL) by leveraging expert demonstrations to pre-train the RL agent. However, the limited availability of expert demonstration data often hinders its ability to effectively aid downstream RL learning. To address this problem, we propose a novel two-stage method dubbed as Skill-enhanced Reinforcement Learning Acceleration (SeRLA). SeRLA introduces a skill-level adversarial Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning model to extract useful skill prior knowledge by enabling learning from both limited expert data and general low-cost demonstration data in the offline prior learning stage. Subsequently, it deploys a skill-based soft actor-critic algorithm to leverage this acquired prior knowledge in the downstream online RL stage for efficient training of a skill policy network. Moreover, we develop a simple skill-level data enhancement technique to further alleviate data sparsity and improve both skill prior learning and downstream skill policy training. Our experimental results on multiple standard RL environments show the proposed SeRLA method achieves state-of-the-art performance on accelerating reinforcement learning on downstream tasks, especially in the early learning phase.</description>

      <title>MSCrackMamba: Leveraging Vision Mamba for Crack Detection in Fused Multispectral Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crack detection is a critical task in structural health monitoring, aimed at assessing the structural integrity of bridges, buildings, and roads to prevent potential failures. Vision-based crack detection has become the mainstream approach due to its ease of implementation and effectiveness. Fusing infrared (IR) channels with red, green and blue (RGB) channels can enhance feature representation and thus improve crack detection. However, IR and RGB channels often differ in resolution. To align them, higher-resolution RGB images typically need to be downsampled to match the IR image resolution, which leads to the loss of fine details. Moreover, crack detection performance is restricted by the limited receptive fields and high computational complexity of traditional image segmentation networks. Inspired by the recently proposed Mamba neural architecture, this study introduces a two-stage paradigm called MSCrackMamba, which leverages Vision Mamba along with a super-resolution network to address these challenges. Specifically, to align IR and RGB channels, we first apply super-resolution to IR channels to match the resolution of RGB channels for data fusion. Vision Mamba is then adopted as the backbone network, while UperNet is employed as the decoder for crack detection. Our approach is validated on the large-scale Crack Detection dataset Crack900, demonstrating an improvement of 3.55% in mIoU compared to the best-performing baseline methods.</description>

      <title>A Self-guided Multimodal Approach to Enhancing Graph Representation Learning for Alzheimer's Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful machine learning models designed to handle irregularly structured data. However, their generic design often proves inadequate for analyzing brain connectomes in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), highlighting the need to incorporate domain knowledge for optimal performance. Infusing AD-related knowledge into GNNs is a complicated task. Existing methods typically rely on collaboration between computer scientists and domain experts, which can be both time-intensive and resource-demanding. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel self-guided, knowledge-infused multimodal GNN that autonomously incorporates domain knowledge into the model development process. Our approach conceptualizes domain knowledge as natural language and introduces a specialized multimodal GNN capable of leveraging this uncurated knowledge to guide the learning process of the GNN, such that it can improve the model performance and strengthen the interpretability of the predictions. To evaluate our framework, we curated a comprehensive dataset of recent peer-reviewed papers on AD and integrated it with multiple real-world AD datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of our method to extract relevant domain knowledge, provide graph-based explanations for AD diagnosis, and improve the overall performance of the GNN. This approach provides a more scalable and efficient alternative to inject domain knowledge for AD compared with the manual design from the domain expert, advancing both prediction accuracy and interpretability in AD diagnosis.</description>

      <title>A Real-Time Defense Against Object Vanishing Adversarial Patch Attacks for Object Detection in Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) increasingly use DNN-based object detection models in vision-based perception. Correct detection and classification of obstacles is critical to ensure safe, trustworthy driving decisions. Adversarial patches aim to fool a DNN with intentionally generated patterns concentrated in a localized region of an image. In particular, object vanishing patch attacks can cause object detection models to fail to detect most or all objects in a scene, posing a significant practical threat to AVs.
  This work proposes ADAV (Adversarial Defense for Autonomous Vehicles), a novel defense methodology against object vanishing patch attacks specifically designed for autonomous vehicles. Unlike existing defense methods which have high latency or are designed for static images, ADAV runs in real-time and leverages contextual information from prior frames in an AV's video feed. ADAV checks if the object detector's output for the target frame is temporally consistent with the output from a previous reference frame to detect the presence of a patch. If the presence of a patch is detected, ADAV uses gradient-based attribution to localize adversarial pixels that break temporal consistency. This two stage procedure allows ADAV to efficiently process clean inputs, and both stages are optimized to be low latency. ADAV is evaluated using real-world driving data from the Berkeley Deep Drive BDD100K dataset, and demonstrates high adversarial and clean performance.</description>

      <title>Data Free Backdoor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks aim to inject a backdoor into a classifier such that it predicts any input with an attacker-chosen backdoor trigger as an attacker-chosen target class. Existing backdoor attacks require either retraining the classifier with some clean data or modifying the model's architecture. As a result, they are 1) not applicable when clean data is unavailable, 2) less efficient when the model is large, and 3) less stealthy due to architecture changes. In this work, we propose DFBA, a novel retraining-free and data-free backdoor attack without changing the model architecture. Technically, our proposed method modifies a few parameters of a classifier to inject a backdoor. Through theoretical analysis, we verify that our injected backdoor is provably undetectable and unremovable by various state-of-the-art defenses under mild assumptions. Our evaluation on multiple datasets further demonstrates that our injected backdoor: 1) incurs negligible classification loss, 2) achieves 100% attack success rates, and 3) bypasses six existing state-of-the-art defenses. Moreover, our comparison with a state-of-the-art non-data-free backdoor attack shows our attack is more stealthy and effective against various defenses while achieving less classification accuracy loss.</description>

      <title>Unseen Attack Detection in Software-Defined Networking Using a BERT-Based Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software defined networking (SDN) represents a transformative shift in network architecture by decoupling the control plane from the data plane, enabling centralized and flexible management of network resources. However, this architectural shift introduces significant security challenges, as SDN's centralized control becomes an attractive target for various types of attacks. While current research has yielded valuable insights into attack detection in SDN, critical gaps remain. Addressing challenges in feature selection, broadening the scope beyond DDoS attacks, strengthening attack decisions based on multi flow analysis, and building models capable of detecting unseen attacks that they have not been explicitly trained on are essential steps toward advancing security in SDN. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the pre trained BERT base model to enhance attack detection in SDN. Our approach transforms network flow data into a format interpretable by language models, allowing BERT to capture intricate patterns and relationships within network traffic. By using Random Forest for feature selection, we optimize model performance and reduce computational overhead, ensuring accurate detection. Attack decisions are made based on several flows, providing stronger and more reliable detection of malicious traffic. Furthermore, our approach is specifically designed to detect previously unseen attacks, offering a solution for identifying threats that the model was not explicitly trained on. To rigorously evaluate our approach, we conducted experiments in two scenarios: one focused on detecting known attacks, achieving 99.96% accuracy, and another on detecting unseen attacks, where our model achieved 99.96% accuracy, demonstrating the robustness of our approach in detecting evolving threats to improve the security of SDN networks.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight U-like Network Utilizing Neural Memory Ordinary Differential Equations for Slimming the Decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, advanced U-like networks have demonstrated remarkable performance in medical image segmentation tasks. However, their drawbacks, including excessive parameters, high computational complexity, and slow inference speed, pose challenges for practical implementation in scenarios with limited computational resources. Existing lightweight U-like networks have alleviated some of these problems, but they often have pre-designed structures and consist of inseparable modules, limiting their application scenarios. In this paper, we propose three plug-and-play decoders by employing different discretization methods of the neural memory Ordinary Differential Equations (nmODEs). These decoders integrate features at various levels of abstraction by processing information from skip connections and performing numerical operations on upward path. Through experiments on the PH2, ISIC2017, and ISIC2018 datasets, we embed these decoders into different U-like networks, demonstrating their effectiveness in significantly reducing the number of parameters and FLOPs while maintaining performance. In summary, the proposed discretized nmODEs decoders are capable of reducing the number of parameters by about 20% ~ 50% and FLOPs by up to 74%, while possessing the potential to adapt to all U-like networks. Our code is available at https://github.com/nayutayuki/Lightweight-nmODE-Decoders-For-U-like-networks.</description>

      <title>Methods for Legal Citation Prediction in the Age of LLMs: An Australian Law Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential across a wide range of legal tasks. Despite these advances, mitigating hallucination remains a significant challenge, with state-of-the-art LLMs still frequently generating incorrect legal references. In this paper, we focus on the problem of legal citation prediction within the Australian law context, where correctly identifying and citing relevant legislations or precedents is critical. We compare several approaches: prompting general purpose and law-specialised LLMs, retrieval-only pipelines with both generic and domain-specific embeddings, task-specific instruction-tuning of LLMs, and hybrid strategies that combine LLMs with retrieval augmentation, query expansion, or voting ensembles. Our findings indicate that domain-specific pre-training alone is insufficient for achieving satisfactory citation accuracy even after law-specialised pre-training. In contrast, instruction tuning on our task-specific dataset dramatically boosts performance reaching the best results across all settings. We also highlight that database granularity along with the type of embeddings play a critical role in the performance of retrieval systems. Among retrieval-based approaches, hybrid methods consistently outperform retrieval-only setups, and among these, ensemble voting delivers the best result by combining the predictive quality of instruction-tuned LLMs with the retrieval system.</description>

      <title>S$^{2}$FT: Efficient, Scalable and Generalizable LLM Fine-tuning by Structured Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current PEFT methods for LLMs can achieve either high quality, efficient training, or scalable serving, but not all three simultaneously. To address this limitation, we investigate sparse fine-tuning and observe a remarkable improvement in generalization ability. Utilizing this key insight, we propose a family of Structured Sparse Fine-Tuning (S$^{2}$FT) methods for LLMs, which concurrently achieve state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance, training efficiency, and inference scalability. S$^{2}$FT accomplishes this by "selecting sparsely and computing densely". It selects a few heads and channels in the MHA and FFN modules for each Transformer block, respectively. Next, it co-permutes weight matrices on both sides of the coupled structures in LLMs to connect the selected components in each layer into a dense submatrix. Finally, S$^{2}$FT performs in-place gradient updates on all submatrices. Through theoretical analysis and empirical results, our method prevents overfitting and forgetting, delivers SOTA performance on both commonsense and arithmetic reasoning with 4.6% and 1.3% average improvements compared to LoRA, and surpasses full FT by 11.5% when generalizing to various domains after instruction tuning. Using our partial backpropagation algorithm, S$^{2}$FT saves training memory up to 3$\times$ and improves latency by 1.5-2.7$\times$ compared to full FT, while delivering an average 10% improvement over LoRA on both metrics. We further demonstrate that the weight updates in S$^{2}$FT can be decoupled into adapters, enabling effective fusion, fast switch, and efficient parallelism for serving multiple fine-tuned models.</description>

      <title>DSAI: Unbiased and Interpretable Latent Feature Extraction for Data-Centric AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to objectively identify latent characteristics in large datasets due to their reliance on pre-trained knowledge rather than actual data patterns. To address this data grounding issue, we propose Data Scientist AI (DSAI), a framework that enables unbiased and interpretable feature extraction through a multi-stage pipeline with quantifiable prominence metrics for evaluating extracted features. On synthetic datasets with known ground-truth features, DSAI demonstrates high recall in identifying expert-defined features while faithfully reflecting the underlying data. Applications on real-world datasets illustrate the framework's practical utility in uncovering meaningful patterns with minimal expert oversight, supporting use cases such as interpretable classification.
  The title of our paper is chosen from multiple candidates based on DSAI-generated criteria.</description>

      <title>PRECISE: Pre-training Sequential Recommenders with Collaborative and Semantic Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world recommendation systems commonly offer diverse content scenarios for users to interact with. Considering the enormous number of users in industrial platforms, it is infeasible to utilize a single unified recommendation model to meet the requirements of all scenarios. Usually, separate recommendation pipelines are established for each distinct scenario. This practice leads to challenges in comprehensively grasping users' interests. Recent research endeavors have been made to tackle this problem by pre-training models to encapsulate the overall interests of users. Traditional pre-trained recommendation models mainly capture user interests by leveraging collaborative signals. Nevertheless, a prevalent drawback of these systems is their incapacity to handle long-tail items and cold-start scenarios. With the recent advent of large language models, there has been a significant increase in research efforts focused on exploiting LLMs to extract semantic information for users and items. However, text-based recommendations highly rely on elaborate feature engineering and frequently fail to capture collaborative similarities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel pre-training framework for sequential recommendation, termed PRECISE. This framework combines collaborative signals with semantic information. Moreover, PRECISE employs a learning framework that initially models users' comprehensive interests across all recommendation scenarios and subsequently concentrates on the specific interests of target-scene behaviors. We demonstrate that PRECISE precisely captures the entire range of user interests and effectively transfers them to the target interests. Empirical findings reveal that the PRECISE framework attains outstanding performance on both public and industrial datasets.</description>

      <title>CAD-Unet: A Capsule Network-Enhanced Unet Architecture for Accurate Segmentation of COVID-19 Lung Infections from CT Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, medical imaging has emerged as a primary modality for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia. In clinical settings, the segmentation of lung infections from computed tomography images enables rapid and accurate quantification and diagnosis of COVID-19. Segmentation of COVID-19 infections in the lungs poses a formidable challenge, primarily due to the indistinct boundaries and limited contrast presented by ground glass opacity manifestations. Moreover, the confounding similarity between infiltrates, lung tissues, and lung walls further complicates this segmentation task. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel deep network architecture, called CAD-Unet, for segmenting COVID-19 lung infections. In this architecture, capsule networks are incorporated into the existing Unet framework. Capsule networks represent a novel network architecture that differs from traditional convolutional neural networks. They utilize vectors for information transfer among capsules, facilitating the extraction of intricate lesion spatial information. Additionally, we design a capsule encoder path and establish a coupling path between the unet encoder and the capsule encoder. This design maximizes the complementary advantages of both network structures while achieving efficient information fusion. \noindent Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on four publicly available datasets, encompassing binary segmentation tasks and multi-class segmentation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the superior segmentation performance of the proposed model. The code has been released at: https://github.com/AmanoTooko-jie/CAD-Unet.</description>

      <title>Not All Errors Are Equal: Investigation of Speech Recognition Errors in Alzheimer's Disease Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) plays an important role in speech-based automatic detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, recognition errors could propagate downstream, potentially impacting the detection decisions. Recent studies have revealed a non-linear relationship between word error rates (WER) and AD detection performance, where ASR transcriptions with notable errors could still yield AD detection accuracy equivalent to that based on manual transcriptions. This work presents a series of analyses to explore the effect of ASR transcription errors in BERT-based AD detection systems. Our investigation reveals that not all ASR errors contribute equally to detection performance. Certain words, such as stopwords, despite constituting a large proportion of errors, are shown to play a limited role in distinguishing AD. In contrast, the keywords related to diagnosis tasks exhibit significantly greater importance relative to other words. These findings provide insights into the interplay between ASR errors and the downstream detection model.</description>

      <title>Augmenting the action space with conventions to improve multi-agent cooperation in Hanabi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The card game Hanabi is considered a strong medium for the testing and development of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, due to its cooperative nature, hidden information, limited communication and remarkable complexity. Previous research efforts have explored the capabilities of MARL algorithms within Hanabi, focusing largely on advanced architecture design and algorithmic manipulations to achieve state-of-the-art performance for a various number of cooperators. However, this often leads to complex solution strategies with high computational cost and requiring large amounts of training data. For humans to solve the Hanabi game effectively, they require the use of conventions, which often allows for a means to implicitly convey ideas or knowledge based on a predefined, and mutually agreed upon, set of ``rules''. Multi-agent problems containing partial observability, especially when limited communication is present, can benefit greatly from the use of implicit knowledge sharing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to augmenting the action space using conventions, which act as special cooperative actions that span over multiple time steps and multiple agents, requiring agents to actively opt in for it to reach fruition. These conventions are based on existing human conventions, and result in a significant improvement on the performance of existing techniques for self-play and cross-play across a various number of cooperators within Hanabi.</description>

      <title>Elastic-DETR: Making Image Resolution Learnable with Content-Specific Network Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-scale image resolution is a de facto standard approach in modern object detectors, such as DETR. This technique allows for the acquisition of various scale information from multiple image resolutions. However, manual hyperparameter selection of the resolution can restrict its flexibility, which is informed by prior knowledge, necessitating human intervention. This work introduces a novel strategy for learnable resolution, called Elastic-DETR, enabling elastic utilization of multiple image resolutions. Our network provides an adaptive scale factor based on the content of the image with a compact scale prediction module (&lt; 2 GFLOPs). The key aspect of our method lies in how to determine the resolution without prior knowledge. We present two loss functions derived from identified key components for resolution optimization: scale loss, which increases adaptiveness according to the image, and distribution loss, which determines the overall degree of scaling based on network performance. By leveraging the resolution's flexibility, we can demonstrate various models that exhibit varying trade-offs between accuracy and computational complexity. We empirically show that our scheme can unleash the potential of a wide spectrum of image resolutions without constraining flexibility. Our models on MS COCO establish a maximum accuracy gain of 3.5%p or 26% decrease in computation than MS-trained DN-DETR.</description>

      <title>Measuring Pre-training Data Quality without Labels for Time Series Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing interest in time series foundation models that generalize across different downstream tasks. A key to strong foundation models is a diverse pre-training dataset, which is particularly challenging to collect for time series classification. In this work, we explore the performance of a contrastive-learning-based foundation model as a function of the data used for pre-training. We introduce contrastive accuracy, a new measure to evaluate the quality of the representation space learned by the foundation model. Our experiments reveal the positive correlation between the proposed measure and the accuracy of the model on a collection of downstream tasks. This suggests that the contrastive accuracy can serve as a criterion to search for time series datasets that can enhance the pre-training and improve thereby the foundation model's generalization.</description>

      <title>Exploring Memorization and Copyright Violation in Frontier LLMs: A Study of the New York Times v. OpenAI 2023 Lawsuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Copyright infringement in frontier LLMs has received much attention recently due to the New York Times v. OpenAI lawsuit, filed in December 2023. The New York Times claims that GPT-4 has infringed its copyrights by reproducing articles for use in LLM training and by memorizing the inputs, thereby publicly displaying them in LLM outputs. Our work aims to measure the propensity of OpenAI's LLMs to exhibit verbatim memorization in its outputs relative to other LLMs, specifically focusing on news articles. We discover that both GPT and Claude models use refusal training and output filters to prevent verbatim output of the memorized articles. We apply a basic prompt template to bypass the refusal training and show that OpenAI models are currently less prone to memorization elicitation than models from Meta, Mistral, and Anthropic. We find that as models increase in size, especially beyond 100 billion parameters, they demonstrate significantly greater capacity for memorization. Our findings have practical implications for training: more attention must be placed on preventing verbatim memorization in very large models. Our findings also have legal significance: in assessing the relative memorization capacity of OpenAI's LLMs, we probe the strength of The New York Times's copyright infringement claims and OpenAI's legal defenses, while underscoring issues at the intersection of generative AI, law, and policy.</description>

      <title>Edge Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient: efficient continuous control for edge scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning is gaining increasing attention thanks to its capability to learn complex policies in high-dimensional settings. Recent advancements utilize a dual-network architecture to learn optimal policies through the Q-learning algorithm. However, this approach has notable drawbacks, such as an overestimation bias that can disrupt the learning process and degrade the performance of the resulting policy. To address this, novel algorithms have been developed that mitigate overestimation bias by employing multiple Q-functions. Edge scenarios, which prioritize privacy, have recently gained prominence. In these settings, limited computational resources pose a significant challenge for complex Machine Learning approaches, making the efficiency of algorithms crucial for their performance. In this work, we introduce a novel Reinforcement Learning algorithm tailored for edge scenarios, called Edge Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (EdgeD3). EdgeD3 enhances the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, achieving significantly improved performance with $25\%$ less Graphics Process Unit (GPU) time while maintaining the same memory usage. Additionally, EdgeD3 consistently matches or surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks, all while using $30\%$ fewer computational resources and requiring $30\%$ less memory.</description>

      <title>BatchTopK Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting language model activations by decomposing them into sparse, interpretable features. A popular approach is the TopK SAE, that uses a fixed number of the most active latents per sample to reconstruct the model activations. We introduce BatchTopK SAEs, a training method that improves upon TopK SAEs by relaxing the top-k constraint to the batch-level, allowing for a variable number of latents to be active per sample. As a result, BatchTopK adaptively allocates more or fewer latents depending on the sample, improving reconstruction without sacrificing average sparsity. We show that BatchTopK SAEs consistently outperform TopK SAEs in reconstructing activations from GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2 2B, and achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art JumpReLU SAEs. However, an advantage of BatchTopK is that the average number of latents can be directly specified, rather than approximately tuned through a costly hyperparameter sweep. We provide code for training and evaluating BatchTopK SAEs at https://github.com/bartbussmann/BatchTopK</description>

      <title>StarWhisper Telescope: Agent-Based Observation Assistant System to Approach AI Astrophysicist</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have introduced convenient and user-friendly methods for leveraging tools across various domains. In the field of astronomical observation, the construction of new telescopes has significantly increased astronomers' workload. Deploying LLM-powered agents can effectively alleviate this burden and reduce the costs associated with training personnel. Within the Nearby Galaxy Supernovae Survey (NGSS) project, which encompasses eight telescopes across three observation sites, aiming to find the transients from the galaxies in 50 mpc, we have developed the \textbf{StarWhisper Telescope System} to manage the entire observation process. This system automates tasks such as generating observation lists, conducting observations, analyzing data, and providing feedback to the observer. Observation lists are customized for different sites and strategies to ensure comprehensive coverage of celestial objects. After manual verification, these lists are uploaded to the telescopes via the agents in the system, which initiates observations upon neutral language. The observed images are analyzed in real-time, and the transients are promptly communicated to the observer. The agent modifies them into a real-time follow-up observation proposal and send to the Xinglong observatory group chat, then add them to the next-day observation lists. Additionally, the integration of AI agents within the system provides online accessibility, saving astronomers' time and encouraging greater participation from amateur astronomers in the NGSS project.</description>

      <title>LLM-BIP: Structured Pruning for Large Language Models with Block-Wise Forward Importance Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various language tasks, but their widespread deployment is impeded by their large size and high computational costs. Structural pruning is a prevailing technique used to introduce sparsity into pre-trained models and facilitate direct hardware acceleration during inference by removing redundant connections (structurally-grouped parameters), such as channels and attention heads. Existing structural pruning approaches often employ either global or layer-wise pruning criteria; however, they are hindered by ineffectiveness stemming from inaccurate evaluation of connection importance. Global pruning methods typically assess component importance using near-zero and unreliable gradients, while layer-wise pruning approaches encounter significant pruning error accumulation issues. To this end, we propose a more accurate pruning metric based on the block-wise importance score propagation, termed LLM-BIP. Specifically, LLM-BIP precisely evaluates connection importance by gauging its influence on the respective transformer block output, which can be efficiently approximated in a single forward pass through an upper bound derived from the assumption of Lipschitz continuity. We evaluate the proposed method using LLaMA-7B, Vicuna-7B, and LLaMA-13B across common zero-shot tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves an average of 3.26% increase in accuracy for common reasoning tasks compared to previous best baselines. It also reduces perplexity by 14.09 and 68.76 on average for the WikiText2 dataset and PTB dataset, respectively.</description>

      <title>How Certain are Uncertainty Estimates? Three Novel Earth Observation Datasets for Benchmarking Uncertainty Quantification in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for assessing the reliability of Earth observation (EO) products. However, the extensive use of machine learning models in EO introduces an additional layer of complexity, as those models themselves are inherently uncertain. While various UQ methods do exist for machine learning models, their performance on EO datasets remains largely unevaluated. A key challenge in the community is the absence of the ground truth for uncertainty, i.e. how certain the uncertainty estimates are, apart from the labels for the image/signal. This article fills this gap by introducing three benchmark datasets specifically designed for UQ in EO machine learning models. These datasets address three common problem types in EO: regression, image segmentation, and scene classification. They enable a transparent comparison of different UQ methods for EO machine learning models. We describe the creation and characteristics of each dataset, including data sources, preprocessing steps, and label generation, with a particular focus on calculating the reference uncertainty. We also showcase baseline performance of several machine learning models on each dataset, highlighting the utility of these benchmarks for model development and comparison. Overall, this article offers a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working in artificial intelligence for EO, promoting a more accurate and reliable quality measure of the outputs of machine learning models. The dataset and code are accessible via https://gitlab.lrz.de/ai4eo/WG_Uncertainty.</description>

      <title>From Uncertainty to Trust: Enhancing Reliability in Vision-Language Models with Uncertainty-Guided Dropout Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in multimodal tasks but are prone to misinterpreting visual inputs, often resulting in hallucinations and unreliable outputs. To address these challenges, we propose Dropout Decoding, a novel inference-time approach that quantifies the uncertainty of visual tokens and selectively masks uncertain tokens to improve decoding. Our method measures the uncertainty of each visual token by projecting it onto the text space and decomposing it into aleatoric and epistemic components. Specifically, we focus on epistemic uncertainty, which captures perception-related errors more effectively. Inspired by dropout regularization, we introduce uncertainty-guided token dropout, which applies the dropout principle to input visual tokens instead of model parameters, and during inference rather than training. By aggregating predictions from an ensemble of masked decoding contexts, Dropout Decoding robustly mitigates errors arising from visual token misinterpretations. Evaluations on benchmarks including CHAIR, THRONE, and MMBench demonstrate that Dropout Decoding significantly reduces object hallucinations (OH) and enhances both reliability and quality of LVLM outputs across diverse visual contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring safety is a crucial and widely discussed topic. However, existing works often overlook the geo-diversity of cultural and legal standards across the world. To demonstrate the challenges posed by geo-diverse safety standards, we introduce SafeWorld, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to generate responses that are not only helpful but also culturally sensitive and legally compliant across diverse global contexts. SafeWorld encompasses 2,342 test user queries, each grounded in high-quality, human-verified cultural norms and legal policies from 50 countries and 493 regions/races. On top of it, we propose a multi-dimensional automatic safety evaluation framework that assesses the contextual appropriateness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of responses. Our evaluations reveal that current LLMs struggle to meet these criteria. To enhance LLMs' alignment with geo-diverse safety standards, we synthesize helpful preference pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) alignment training. The preference pair construction aims to encourage LLMs to behave appropriately and provide precise references to relevant cultural norms and policies when necessary. Our trained SafeWorldLM outperforms all competing models, including GPT-4o on all three evaluation dimensions by a large margin. Global human evaluators also note a nearly 20% higher winning rate in helpfulness and harmfulness evaluation. Our code and data can be found here: https://github.com/PlusLabNLP/SafeWorld.</description>

      <title>SimuDICE: Offline Policy Optimization Through World Model Updates and DICE Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, deriving an effective policy from a pre-collected set of experiences is challenging due to the distribution mismatch between the target policy and the behavioral policy used to collect the data, as well as the limited sample size. Model-based reinforcement learning improves sample efficiency by generating simulated experiences using a learned dynamic model of the environment. However, these synthetic experiences often suffer from the same distribution mismatch. To address these challenges, we introduce SimuDICE, a framework that iteratively refines the initial policy derived from offline data using synthetically generated experiences from the world model. SimuDICE enhances the quality of these simulated experiences by adjusting the sampling probabilities of state-action pairs based on stationary DIstribution Correction Estimation (DICE) and the estimated confidence in the model's predictions. This approach guides policy improvement by balancing experiences similar to those frequently encountered with ones that have a distribution mismatch. Our experiments show that SimuDICE achieves performance comparable to existing algorithms while requiring fewer pre-collected experiences and planning steps, and it remains robust across varying data collection policies.</description>

Based on the knowledge from the large-scale pre-training, existing text-to-image anomaly synthesis methods predominantly focus on textual information or coarse-aligned visual features to guide the entire generation process. However, these methods often lack sufficient descriptors to capture the complicated characteristics of realistic anomalies (e.g., the fine-grained visual pattern of anomalies), limiting the realism and generalization of the generation process. To this end, we propose a novel anomaly synthesis framework called AnomalyControl to learn cross-modal semantic features as guidance signals, which could encode the generalized anomaly cues from text-image reference prompts and improve the realism of synthesized abnormal samples. Specifically, AnomalyControl adopts a flexible and non-matching prompt pair (i.e., a text-image reference prompt and a targeted text prompt), where a Cross-modal Semantic Modeling (CSM) module is designed to extract cross-modal semantic features from the textual and visual descriptors. Then, an Anomaly-Semantic Enhanced Attention (ASEA) mechanism is formulated to allow CSM to focus on the specific visual patterns of the anomaly, thus enhancing the realism and contextual relevance of the generated anomaly features. Treating cross-modal semantic features as the prior, a Semantic Guided Adapter (SGA) is designed to encode effective guidance signals for the adequate and controllable synthesis process. Extensive experiments indicate that AnomalyControl can achieve state-of-the-art results in anomaly synthesis compared with existing methods while exhibiting superior performance for downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>HES-UNet: A U-Net for Hepatic Echinococcosis Lesion Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hepatic echinococcosis (HE) is a prevalent disease in economically underdeveloped pastoral areas, where adequate medical resources are usually lacking. Existing methods often ignore multi-scale feature fusion or focus only on feature fusion between adjacent levels, which may lead to insufficient feature fusion. To address these issues, we propose HES-UNet, an efficient and accurate model for HE lesion segmentation. This model combines convolutional layers and attention modules to capture local and global features. During downsampling, the multi-directional downsampling block (MDB) is employed to integrate high-frequency and low-frequency features, effectively extracting image details. The multi-scale aggregation block (MAB) aggregates multi-scale feature information. In contrast, the multi-scale upsampling Block (MUB) learns highly abstract features and supplies this information to the skip connection module to fuse multi-scale features. Due to the distinct regional characteristics of HE, there is currently no publicly available high-quality dataset for training our model. We collected CT slice data from 268 patients at a certain hospital to train and evaluate the model. The experimental results show that HES-UNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on our dataset, achieving an overall Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 89.21%, which is 1.09% higher than that of TransUNet.

      <title>Unraveling the Complexity of Memory in RL Agents: an Approach for Classification and Evaluation</title>

Abstract: The incorporation of memory into agents is essential for numerous tasks within the domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL). In particular, memory is paramount for tasks that require the utilization of past information, adaptation to novel environments, and improved sample efficiency. However, the term ``memory'' encompasses a wide range of concepts, which, coupled with the lack of a unified methodology for validating an agent's memory, leads to erroneous judgments about agents' memory capabilities and prevents objective comparison with other memory-enhanced agents. This paper aims to streamline the concept of memory in RL by providing practical precise definitions of agent memory types, such as long-term versus short-term memory and declarative versus procedural memory, inspired by cognitive science. Using these definitions, we categorize different classes of agent memory, propose a robust experimental methodology for evaluating the memory capabilities of RL agents, and standardize evaluations. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate the importance of adhering to the proposed methodology when evaluating different types of agent memory by conducting experiments with different RL agents and what its violation leads to.</description>

      <title>Sloth: scaling laws for LLM skills to predict multi-benchmark performance across families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) predict model performance based on parameters like size and training data. However, differences in training configurations and data processing across model families lead to significant variations in benchmark performance, making it difficult for a single scaling law to generalize across all LLMs. On the other hand, training family-specific scaling laws requires training models of varying sizes for every family. In this work, we propose Skills Scaling Laws (SSLaws, pronounced as Sloth), a novel scaling law that leverages publicly available benchmark data and assumes LLM performance is driven by low-dimensional latent skills, such as reasoning and instruction following. These latent skills are influenced by computational resources like model size and training tokens but with varying efficiencies across model families. Sloth exploits correlations across benchmarks to provide more accurate and interpretable predictions while alleviating the need to train multiple LLMs per family. We present both theoretical results on parameter identification and empirical evaluations on 12 prominent benchmarks, from Open LLM Leaderboard v1/v2, demonstrating that Sloth predicts LLM performance efficiently and offers insights into scaling behaviors for downstream tasks such as coding and emotional intelligence applications.</description>

      <title>EmoSpeech: A Corpus of Emotionally Rich and Contextually Detailed Speech Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in text-to-speech (TTS) technology have significantly improved the quality of generated speech, closely matching the timbre and intonation of the target speaker. However, due to the inherent complexity of human emotional expression, the development of TTS systems capable of controlling subtle emotional differences remains a formidable challenge. Existing emotional speech databases often suffer from overly simplistic labelling schemes that fail to capture a wide range of emotional states, thus limiting the effectiveness of emotion synthesis in TTS applications. To this end, recent efforts have focussed on building databases that use natural language annotations to describe speech emotions. However, these approaches are costly and require more emotional depth to train robust systems. In this paper, we propose a novel process aimed at building databases by systematically extracting emotion-rich speech segments and annotating them with detailed natural language descriptions through a generative model. This approach enhances the emotional granularity of the database and significantly reduces the reliance on costly manual annotations by automatically augmenting the data with high-level language models. The resulting rich database provides a scalable and economically viable solution for developing a more nuanced and dynamic basis for developing emotionally controlled TTS systems.</description>

      <title>Advancing Music Therapy: Integrating Eastern Five-Element Music Theory and Western Techniques with AI in the Novel Five-Element Harmony System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In traditional medical practices, music therapy has proven effective in treating various psychological and physiological ailments. Particularly in Eastern traditions, the Five Elements Music Therapy (FEMT), rooted in traditional Chinese medicine, possesses profound cultural significance and unique therapeutic philosophies. With the rapid advancement of Information Technology and Artificial Intelligence, applying these modern technologies to FEMT could enhance the personalization and cultural relevance of the therapy and potentially improve therapeutic outcomes. In this article, we developed a music therapy system for the first time by applying the theory of the five elements in music therapy to practice. This innovative approach integrates advanced Information Technology and Artificial Intelligence with Five-Element Music Therapy (FEMT) to enhance personalized music therapy practices. As traditional music therapy predominantly follows Western methodologies, the unique aspects of Eastern practices, specifically the Five-Element theory from traditional Chinese medicine, should be considered. This system aims to bridge this gap by utilizing computational technologies to provide a more personalized, culturally relevant, and therapeutically effective music therapy experience.</description>

      <title>Towards Controllable Speech Synthesis in the Era of Large Language Models: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS), also known as speech synthesis, is a prominent research area that aims to generate natural-sounding human speech from text. Recently, with the increasing industrial demand, TTS technologies have evolved beyond synthesizing human-like speech to enabling controllable speech generation. This includes fine-grained control over various attributes of synthesized speech such as emotion, prosody, timbre, and duration. Besides, advancements in deep learning, such as diffusion and large language models, have significantly enhanced controllable TTS over the past several years. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of controllable TTS, covering approaches ranging from basic control techniques to methods utilizing natural language prompts, aiming to provide a clear understanding of the current state of research. We examine the general controllable TTS pipeline, challenges, model architectures, and control strategies, offering a comprehensive and clear taxonomy of existing methods. Additionally, we provide a detailed summary of datasets and evaluation metrics and shed some light on the applications and future directions of controllable TTS. To the best of our knowledge, this survey paper provides the first comprehensive review of emerging controllable TTS methods, which can serve as a beneficial resource for both academic researchers and industry practitioners.</description>

      <title>Fundus Image-based Visual Acuity Assessment with PAC-Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timely detection and treatment are essential for maintaining eye health. Visual acuity (VA), which measures the clarity of vision at a distance, is a crucial metric for managing eye health. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been introduced to assist in VA measurement, potentially alleviating clinicians' workloads. However, the inherent uncertainties in ML models make relying solely on them for VA prediction less than ideal. The VA prediction task involves multiple sources of uncertainty, requiring more robust approaches. A promising method is to build prediction sets or intervals rather than point estimates, offering coverage guarantees through techniques like conformal prediction and Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) prediction sets. Despite the potential, to date, these approaches have not been applied to the VA prediction task.To address this, we propose a method for deriving prediction intervals for estimating visual acuity from fundus images with a PAC guarantee. Our experimental results demonstrate that the PAC guarantees are upheld, with performance comparable to or better than that of two prior works that do not provide such guarantees.</description>

      <title>Beyond Scalars: Concept-Based Alignment Analysis in Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) can be trained using various learning paradigms, from fully supervised to self-supervised. Diverse training protocols often result in significantly different feature spaces, which are usually compared through alignment analysis. However, current alignment measures quantify this relationship in terms of a single scalar value, obscuring the distinctions between common and unique features in pairs of representations that share the same scalar alignment. We address this limitation by combining alignment analysis with concept discovery, which enables a breakdown of alignment into single concepts encoded in feature space. This fine-grained comparison reveals both universal and unique concepts across different representations, as well as the internal structure of concepts within each of them. Our methodological contributions address two key prerequisites for concept-based alignment: 1) For a description of the representation in terms of concepts that faithfully capture the geometry of the feature space, we define concepts as the most general structure they can possibly form - arbitrary manifolds, allowing hidden features to be described by their proximity to these manifolds. 2) To measure distances between concept proximity scores of two representations, we use a generalized Rand index and partition it for alignment between pairs of concepts. We confirm the superiority of our novel concept definition for alignment analysis over existing linear baselines in a sanity check. The concept-based alignment analysis of representations from four different ViTs reveals that increased supervision correlates with a reduction in the semantic structure of learned representations.</description>

      <title>Detecting Facial Image Manipulations with Multi-Layer CNN Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of digital image manipulation techniques poses significant challenges for content verification, with models such as stable diffusion and mid-journey producing highly realistic, yet synthetic, images that can deceive human perception. This research develops and evaluates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) specifically tailored for the detection of these manipulated images. The study implements a comparative analysis of three progressively complex CNN architectures, assessing their ability to classify and localize manipulations across various facial image modifications. Regularization and optimization techniques were systematically incorporated to improve feature extraction and performance. The results indicate that the proposed models achieve an accuracy of up to 76\% in distinguishing manipulated images from genuine ones, surpassing traditional approaches. This research not only highlights the potential of CNNs in enhancing the robustness of digital media verification tools, but also provides insights into effective architectural adaptations and training strategies for low-computation environments. Future work will build on these findings by extending the architectures to handle more diverse manipulation techniques and integrating multi-modal data for improved detection capabilities.</description>

      <title>Policy Agnostic RL: Offline RL and Online RL Fine-Tuning of Any Class and Backbone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in learning decision-making policies can largely be attributed to training expressive policy models, largely via imitation learning. While imitation learning discards non-expert data, reinforcement learning (RL) can still learn from suboptimal data. However, instantiating RL training of a new policy class often presents a different challenge: most deep RL machinery is co-developed with assumptions on the policy class and backbone, resulting in poor performance when the policy class changes. For instance, SAC utilizes a low-variance reparameterization policy gradient for Gaussian policies, but this is unstable for diffusion policies and intractable for autoregressive categorical policies. To address this issue, we develop an offline RL and online fine-tuning approach called policy-agnostic RL (PA-RL) that can effectively train multiple policy classes, with varying architectures and sizes. We build off the basic idea that a universal supervised learning loss can replace the policy improvement step in RL, as long as it is applied on "optimized" actions. To obtain these optimized actions, we first sample multiple actions from a base policy, and run global optimization (i.e., re-ranking multiple action samples using the Q-function) and local optimization (i.e., running gradient steps on an action sample) to maximize the critic on these candidates. PA-RL enables fine-tuning diffusion and transformer policies with either autoregressive tokens or continuous action outputs, at different sizes, entirely via actor-critic RL. Moreover, PA-RL improves the performance and sample-efficiency by up to 2 times compared to existing offline RL and online fine-tuning methods. We show the first result that successfully fine-tunes OpenVLA, a 7B generalist robot policy, autonomously with Cal-QL, an online RL fine-tuning algorithm, improving from 40% to 70% in the real world in 40 minutes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital Twins have emerged as a disruptive technology with great potential; they can enhance WDS by offering real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and optimization capabilities. This paper describes the development of a state-of-the-art DT platform for WDS, introducing advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning models. This paper provides insight into the architecture of the proposed platform-CAUCCES-that, informed by both historical and meteorological data, effectively deploys AI/ML models like LSTM networks, Prophet, LightGBM, and XGBoost in trying to predict water consumption patterns. Furthermore, we delve into how optimization in the maintenance of WDS can be achieved by formulating a Constraint Programming problem for scheduling, hence minimizing the operational cost efficiently with reduced environmental impacts. It also focuses on cybersecurity and protection to ensure the integrity and reliability of the DT platform. In this view, the system will contribute to improvements in decision-making capabilities, operational efficiency, and system reliability, with reassurance being drawn from the important role it can play toward sustainable management of water resources.</description>

Abstract: Source separation is the process of isolating individual sounds in an auditory mixture of multiple sounds [1], and has a variety of applications ranging from speech enhancement and lyric transcription [2] to digital audio production for music. Furthermore, Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) is the process of converting raw music audio into sheet music that musicians can read [3]. Historically, these tasks have faced challenges such as significant audio noise, long training times, and lack of free-use data due to copyright restrictions. However, recent developments in deep learning have brought new promising approaches to building low-distortion stems and generating sheet music from audio signals [4]. Using spectrogram masking, deep neural networks, and the MuseScore API, we attempt to create an end-to-end pipeline that allows for an initial music audio mixture (e.g...wav file) to be separated into instrument stems, converted into MIDI files, and transcribed into sheet music for each component instrument.</description>

      <title>Parkinson's Disease Diagnosis Through Deep Learning: A Novel LSTM-Based Approach for Freezing of Gait Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning holds tremendous potential in healthcare for uncovering hidden patterns within extensive clinical datasets, aiding in the diagnosis of various diseases. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by the deterioration of brain function. In the initial stages of PD, automatic diagnosis poses a challenge due to the similarity in behavior between individuals with PD and those who are healthy. Our objective is to propose an effective model that can aid in the early detection of Parkinson's disease. We employed the VGRF gait signal dataset sourced from Physionet for distinguishing between healthy individuals and those diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. This paper introduces a novel deep learning architecture based on the LSTM network for automatically detecting freezing of gait episodes in Parkinson's disease patients. In contrast to conventional machine learning algorithms, this method eliminates manual feature engineering and proficiently captures prolonged temporal dependencies in gait patterns, thereby improving the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The LSTM network resolves the issue of vanishing gradients by employing memory blocks in place of self-connected hidden units, allowing for optimal information assimilation. To prevent overfitting, dropout and L2 regularization techniques have been employed. Additionally, the stochastic gradient-based optimizer Adam is used for the optimization process. The results indicate that our proposed approach surpasses current state-of-the-art models in FOG episode detection, achieving an accuracy of 97.71%, sensitivity of 99%, precision of 98%, and specificity of 96%. This demonstrates its potential as a superior classification method for Parkinson's disease detection.</description>

      <title>Toward Non-Invasive Diagnosis of Bankart Lesions with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bankart lesions, or anterior-inferior glenoid labral tears, are diagnostically challenging on standard MRIs due to their subtle imaging features-often necessitating invasive MRI arthrograms (MRAs). This study develops deep learning (DL) models to detect Bankart lesions on both standard MRIs and MRAs, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce reliance on MRAs. We curated a dataset of 586 shoulder MRIs (335 standard, 251 MRAs) from 558 patients who underwent arthroscopy. Ground truth labels were derived from intraoperative findings, the gold standard for Bankart lesion diagnosis. Separate DL models for MRAs and standard MRIs were trained using the Swin Transformer architecture, pre-trained on a public knee MRI dataset. Predictions from sagittal, axial, and coronal views were ensembled to optimize performance. The models were evaluated on a 20% hold-out test set (117 MRIs: 46 MRAs, 71 standard MRIs). Bankart lesions were identified in 31.9% of MRAs and 8.6% of standard MRIs. The models achieved AUCs of 0.87 (86% accuracy, 83% sensitivity, 86% specificity) and 0.90 (85% accuracy, 82% sensitivity, 86% specificity) on standard MRIs and MRAs, respectively. These results match or surpass radiologist performance on our dataset and reported literature metrics. Notably, our model's performance on non-invasive standard MRIs matched or surpassed the radiologists interpreting MRAs. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using DL to address the diagnostic challenges posed by subtle pathologies like Bankart lesions. Our models demonstrate potential to improve diagnostic confidence, reduce reliance on invasive imaging, and enhance accessibility to care.</description>

      <title>ContRail: A Framework for Realistic Railway Image Synthesis using ControlNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning became an ubiquitous paradigm due to its extraordinary effectiveness and applicability in numerous domains. However, the approach suffers from the high demand of data required to achieve the potential of this type of model. An ever-increasing sub-field of Artificial Intelligence, Image Synthesis, aims to address this limitation through the design of intelligent models capable of creating original and realistic images, endeavour which could drastically reduce the need for real data. The Stable Diffusion generation paradigm recently propelled state-of-the-art approaches to exceed all previous benchmarks. In this work, we propose the ContRail framework based on the novel Stable Diffusion model ControlNet, which we empower through a multi-modal conditioning method. We experiment with the task of synthetic railway image generation, where we improve the performance in rail-specific tasks, such as rail semantic segmentation by enriching the dataset with realistic synthetic images.</description>

      <title>XRZoo: A Large-Scale and Versatile Dataset of Extended Reality (XR) Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Extended Reality (XR, encompassing AR, MR, and VR) and spatial computing technologies forms a foundational layer for the emerging Metaverse, enabling innovative applications across healthcare, education, manufacturing, and entertainment. However, research in this area is often limited by the lack of large, representative, and highquality application datasets that can support empirical studies and the development of new approaches benefiting XR software processes. In this paper, we introduce XRZoo, a comprehensive and curated dataset of XR applications designed to bridge this gap. XRZoo contains 12,528 free XR applications, spanning nine app stores, across all XR techniques (i.e., AR, MR, and VR) and use cases, with detailed metadata on key aspects such as application descriptions, application categories, release dates, user review numbers, and hardware specifications, etc. By making XRZoo publicly available, we aim to foster reproducible XR software engineering and security research, enable cross-disciplinary investigations, and also support the development of advanced XR systems by providing examples to developers. Our dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in improving the scalability, usability, and effectiveness of XR applications. XRZoo will be released and actively maintained.</description>

      <title>Visual Lexicon: Rich Image Features in Language Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Visual Lexicon, a novel visual language that encodes rich image information into the text space of vocabulary tokens while retaining intricate visual details that are often challenging to convey in natural language. Unlike traditional methods that prioritize either high-level semantics (e.g., CLIP) or pixel-level reconstruction (e.g., VAE), ViLex simultaneously captures rich semantic content and fine visual details, enabling high-quality image generation and comprehensive visual scene understanding. Through a self-supervised learning pipeline, ViLex generates tokens optimized for reconstructing input images using a frozen text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, preserving the detailed information necessary for high-fidelity semantic-level reconstruction. As an image embedding in the language space, ViLex tokens leverage the compositionality of natural languages, allowing them to be used independently as "text tokens" or combined with natural language tokens to prompt pretrained T2I models with both visual and textual inputs, mirroring how we interact with vision-language models (VLMs). Experiments demonstrate that ViLex achieves higher fidelity in image reconstruction compared to text embeddings--even with a single ViLex token. Moreover, ViLex successfully performs various DreamBooth tasks in a zero-shot, unsupervised manner without fine-tuning T2I models. Additionally, ViLex serves as a powerful vision encoder, consistently improving vision-language model performance across 15 benchmarks relative to a strong SigLIP baseline.</description>

      <title>Delve into Visual Contrastive Decoding for Hallucination Mitigation of Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating plausible responses correlated with input visual contents, they still suffer from hallucinations, where the generated text inaccurately reflects visual contents. To address this, recent approaches apply contrastive decoding to calibrate the model's response via contrasting output distributions with original and visually distorted samples, demonstrating promising hallucination mitigation in a training-free manner. However, the potential of changing information in visual inputs is not well-explored, so a deeper investigation into the behaviors of visual contrastive decoding is of great interest. In this paper, we first explore various methods for contrastive decoding to change visual contents, including image downsampling and editing. Downsampling images reduces the detailed textual information while editing yields new contents in images, providing new aspects as visual contrastive samples. To further study benefits by using different contrastive samples, we analyze probability-level metrics, including entropy and distribution distance. Interestingly, the effect of these samples in mitigating hallucinations varies a lot across LVLMs and benchmarks. Based on our analysis, we propose a simple yet effective method to combine contrastive samples, offering a practical solution for applying contrastive decoding across various scenarios. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed fusion method among different benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Driv3R: Learning Dense 4D Reconstruction for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realtime 4D reconstruction for dynamic scenes remains a crucial challenge for autonomous driving perception. Most existing methods rely on depth estimation through self-supervision or multi-modality sensor fusion. In this paper, we propose Driv3R, a DUSt3R-based framework that directly regresses per-frame point maps from multi-view image sequences. To achieve streaming dense reconstruction, we maintain a memory pool to reason both spatial relationships across sensors and dynamic temporal contexts to enhance multi-view 3D consistency and temporal integration. Furthermore, we employ a 4D flow predictor to identify moving objects within the scene to direct our network focus more on reconstructing these dynamic regions. Finally, we align all per-frame pointmaps consistently to the world coordinate system in an optimization-free manner. We conduct extensive experiments on the large-scale nuScenes dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. Driv3R outperforms previous frameworks in 4D dynamic scene reconstruction, achieving 15x faster inference speed compared to methods requiring global alignment.

      <title>AnyBimanual: Transferring Unimanual Policy for General Bimanual Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Performing general language-conditioned bimanual manipulation tasks is of great importance for many applications ranging from household service to industrial assembly. However, collecting bimanual manipulation data is expensive due to the high-dimensional action space, which poses challenges for conventional methods to handle general bimanual manipulation tasks. In contrast, unimanual policy has recently demonstrated impressive generalizability across a wide range of tasks because of scaled model parameters and training data, which can provide sharable manipulation knowledge for bimanual systems. To this end, we propose a plug-and-play method named AnyBimanual, which transfers pre-trained unimanual policy to general bimanual manipulation policy with few bimanual demonstrations. Specifically, we first introduce a skill manager to dynamically schedule the skill representations discovered from pre-trained unimanual policy for bimanual manipulation tasks, which linearly combines skill primitives with task-oriented compensation to represent the bimanual manipulation instruction. To mitigate the observation discrepancy between unimanual and bimanual systems, we present a visual aligner to generate soft masks for visual embedding of the workspace, which aims to align visual input of unimanual policy model for each arm with those during pretraining stage. AnyBimanual shows superiority on 12 simulated tasks from RLBench2 with a sizable 12.67% improvement in success rate over previous methods. Experiments on 9 real-world tasks further verify its practicality with an average success rate of 84.62%.</description>

      <title>P3-PO: Prescriptive Point Priors for Visuo-Spatial Generalization of Robot Policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing generalizable robot policies that can robustly handle varied environmental conditions and object instances remains a fundamental challenge in robot learning. While considerable efforts have focused on collecting large robot datasets and developing policy architectures to learn from such data, naively learning from visual inputs often results in brittle policies that fail to transfer beyond the training data. This work presents Prescriptive Point Priors for Policies or P3-PO, a novel framework that constructs a unique state representation of the environment leveraging recent advances in computer vision and robot learning to achieve improved out-of-distribution generalization for robot manipulation. This representation is obtained through two steps. First, a human annotator prescribes a set of semantically meaningful points on a single demonstration frame. These points are then propagated through the dataset using off-the-shelf vision models. The derived points serve as an input to state-of-the-art policy architectures for policy learning. Our experiments across four real-world tasks demonstrate an overall 43% absolute improvement over prior methods when evaluated in identical settings as training. Further, P3-PO exhibits 58% and 80% gains across tasks for new object instances and more cluttered environments respectively. Videos illustrating the robot's performance are best viewed at point-priors.github.io.</description>

Abstract: In generative models, two paradigms have gained attraction in various applications: next-set prediction-based Masked Generative Models and next-noise prediction-based Non-Autoregressive Models, e.g., Diffusion Models. In this work, we propose using discrete-state models to connect them and explore their scalability in the vision domain. First, we conduct a step-by-step analysis in a unified design space across two types of models including timestep-independence, noise schedule, temperature, guidance strength, etc in a scalable manner. Second, we re-cast typical discriminative tasks, e.g., image segmentation, as an unmasking process from [MASK]tokens on a discrete-state model. This enables us to perform various sampling processes, including flexible conditional sampling by only training once to model the joint distribution. All aforementioned explorations lead to our framework named Discrete Interpolants, which enables us to achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to previous discrete-state based methods in various benchmarks, like ImageNet256, MS COCO, and video dataset FaceForensics. In summary, by leveraging [MASK] in discrete-state models, we can bridge Masked Generative and Non-autoregressive Diffusion models, as well as generative and discriminative tasks.</description>

      <title>From Concept to Manufacturing: Evaluating Vision-Language Models for Engineering Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Engineering design is undergoing a transformative shift with the advent of AI, marking a new era in how we approach product, system, and service planning. Large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in enabling this shift. Yet, with text as their only input modality, they cannot leverage the large body of visual artifacts that engineers have used for centuries and are accustomed to. This gap is addressed with the release of multimodal vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-4V, enabling AI to impact many more types of tasks. Our work presents a comprehensive evaluation of VLMs across a spectrum of engineering design tasks, categorized into four main areas: Conceptual Design, System-Level and Detailed Design, Manufacturing and Inspection, and Engineering Education Tasks. Specifically in this paper, we assess the capabilities of two VLMs, GPT-4V and LLaVA 1.6 34B, in design tasks such as sketch similarity analysis, CAD generation, topology optimization, manufacturability assessment, and engineering textbook problems. Through this structured evaluation, we not only explore VLMs' proficiency in handling complex design challenges but also identify their limitations in complex engineering design applications. Our research establishes a foundation for future assessments of vision language models. It also contributes a set of benchmark testing datasets, with more than 1000 queries, for ongoing advancements and applications in this field.</description>

      <title>A philosophical and ontological perspective on Artificial General Intelligence and the Metaverse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper leverages various philosophical and ontological frameworks to explore the concept of embodied artificial general intelligence (AGI), its relationship to human consciousness, and the key role of the metaverse in facilitating this relationship. Several theoretical frameworks underpin this exploration, such as embodied cognition, Michael Levin's computational boundary of a "Self," Donald D. Hoffman's Interface Theory of Perception, and Bernardo Kastrup's analytical idealism, which lead to considering our perceived outer reality as a symbolic representation of alternate inner states of being, and where AGI could embody a different form of consciousness with a larger computational boundary. The paper further discusses the developmental stages of AGI, the requirements for the emergence of an embodied AGI, the importance of a calibrated symbolic interface for AGI, and the key role played by the metaverse, decentralized systems, open-source blockchain technology, as well as open-source AI research. It also explores the idea of a feedback loop between AGI and human users in metaverse spaces as a tool for AGI calibration, as well as the role of local homeostasis and decentralized governance as preconditions for achieving a stable embodied AGI. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of achieving a certain degree of harmony in human relations and recognizing the interconnectedness of humanity at a global level, as key prerequisites for the emergence of a stable embodied AGI.</description>

      <title>Hybrid RAG-empowered Multi-modal LLM for Secure Data Management in Internet of Medical Things: A Diffusion-based Contract Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Secure data management and effective data sharing have become paramount in the rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, especially with the growing integration of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The rise of generative artificial intelligence has further elevated Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as essential tools for managing and optimizing healthcare data in IoMT. MLLMs can support multi-modal inputs and generate diverse types of content by leveraging large-scale training on vast amounts of multi-modal data. However, critical challenges persist in developing medical MLLMs, including security and freshness issues of healthcare data, affecting the output quality of MLLMs. To this end, in this paper, we propose a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-empowered medical MLLM framework for healthcare data management. This framework leverages a hierarchical cross-chain architecture to facilitate secure data training. Moreover, it enhances the output quality of MLLMs through hybrid RAG, which employs multi-modal metrics to filter various unimodal RAG results and incorporates these retrieval results as additional inputs to MLLMs. Additionally, we employ age of information to indirectly evaluate the data freshness impact of MLLMs and utilize contract theory to incentivize healthcare data holders to share their fresh data, mitigating information asymmetry during data sharing. Finally, we utilize a generative diffusion model-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm to identify the optimal contract for efficient data sharing. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes, which achieve secure and efficient healthcare data management.</description>

      <title>Language Model Powered Digital Biology with BRAD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02864v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming biology, computer science, engineering, and every day life. However, integrating the wide array of computational tools, databases, and scientific literature continues to pose a challenge to biological research. LLMs are well-suited for unstructured integration, efficient information retrieval, and automating standard workflows and actions from these diverse resources. To harness these capabilities in bioinformatics, we present a prototype Bioinformatics Retrieval Augmented Digital assistant (BRAD). BRAD is a chatbot and agentic system that integrates a variety of bioinformatics tools. The Python package implements an AI \texttt{Agent} that is powered by LLMs and connects to a local file system, online databases, and a user's software. The \texttt{Agent} is highly configurable, enabling tasks such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation, searches across bioinformatics databases, and the execution of software pipelines. BRAD's coordinated integration of bioinformatics tools delivers a context-aware and semi-autonomous system that extends beyond the capabilities of conventional LLM-based chatbots. A graphical user interface (GUI) provides an intuitive interface to the system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce SAM4MLLM, an innovative approach which integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for pixel-aware tasks. Our method enables MLLMs to learn pixel-level location information without requiring excessive modifications to the existing model architecture or adding specialized tokens. We introduce an inquiry-based approach that can effectively find prompt points for SAM to perform segmentation based on MLLM. It combines detailed visual information with the powerful expressive capabilities of large language models in a unified language-based manner without additional computational overhead in learning. Experimental results on pubic benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>MaskLLM: Learnable Semi-Structured Sparsity for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are distinguished by their massive parameter counts, which typically result in significant redundancy. This work introduces MaskLLM, a learnable pruning method that establishes Semi-structured (or ``N:M'') Sparsity in LLMs, aimed at reducing computational overhead during inference. Instead of developing a new importance criterion, MaskLLM explicitly models N:M patterns as a learnable distribution through Gumbel Softmax sampling. This approach facilitates end-to-end training on large-scale datasets and offers two notable advantages: 1) High-quality Masks - our method effectively scales to large datasets and learns accurate masks; 2) Transferability - the probabilistic modeling of mask distribution enables the transfer learning of sparsity across domains or tasks. We assessed MaskLLM using 2:4 sparsity on various LLMs, including LLaMA-2, Nemotron-4, and GPT-3, with sizes ranging from 843M to 15B parameters, and our empirical results show substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods. For instance, leading approaches achieve a perplexity (PPL) of 10 or greater on Wikitext compared to the dense model's 5.12 PPL, but MaskLLM achieves a significantly lower 6.72 PPL solely by learning the masks with frozen weights. Furthermore, MaskLLM's learnable nature allows customized masks for lossless application of 2:4 sparsity to downstream tasks or domains.

      <title>System 2 Reasoning via Generality and Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While significant progress has been made in task-specific applications, current models struggle with deep reasoning, generality, and adaptation -- key components of System 2 reasoning that are crucial for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite the promise of approaches such as program synthesis, language models, and transformers, these methods often fail to generalize beyond their training data and to adapt to novel tasks, limiting their ability to perform human-like reasoning. This paper explores the limitations of existing approaches in achieving advanced System 2 reasoning and highlights the importance of generality and adaptation for AGI. Moreover, we propose four key research directions to address these gaps: (1) learning human intentions from action sequences, (2) combining symbolic and neural models, (3) meta-learning for unfamiliar environments, and (4) reinforcement learning to reason multi-step. Through these directions, we aim to advance the ability to generalize and adapt, bringing computational models closer to the reasoning capabilities required for AGI.</description>

      <title>Hallucination Detox: Sensitive Neuron Dropout (SeND) for Large Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across various industries, concerns regarding their reliability, particularly due to hallucinations - outputs that are factually inaccurate or irrelevant to user input - have grown. Our research investigates the relationship between the training process and the emergence of hallucinations to address a key gap in existing research that focuses primarily on post hoc detection and mitigation strategies. Using models from the Pythia suite (70M - 12B parameters) and several hallucination detection metrics, we analyze hallucination trends throughout training and explore LLM internal dynamics. We introduce Sensitivity Dropout (SenD), a novel training protocol designed to mitigate hallucinations by reducing variance during training. SenD achieves this by deterministically dropping embedding indices with significant variability, referred to as Sensitive Embedding Indices. In addition, we develop an unsupervised hallucination detection metric, Efficient EigenScore (EES), which approximates the traditional EigenScore at 2x speed. This efficient metric is integrated into our protocol, allowing SenD to be both computationally scalable and effective at reducing hallucinations. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our approach improves LLM reliability at test time by up to 40% compared to normal training while also providing an efficient method to improve factual accuracy when adapting LLMs to Wikipedia, Medical, and LegalBench domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17218v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creativity is the ability to produce novel, useful, and surprising ideas, and has been widely studied as a crucial aspect of human cognition. Machine creativity on the other hand has been a long-standing challenge. With the rise of advanced generative AI, there has been renewed interest and debate regarding AI's creative capabilities. Therefore, it is imperative to revisit the state of creativity in AI and identify key progresses and remaining challenges. In this work, we survey leading works studying the creative capabilities of AI systems, focusing on creative problem-solving, linguistic, artistic, and scientific creativity. Our review suggests that while the latest AI models are largely capable of producing linguistically and artistically creative outputs such as poems, images, and musical pieces, they struggle with tasks that require creative problem-solving, abstract thinking and compositionality and their generations suffer from a lack of diversity, originality, long-range incoherence and hallucinations. We also discuss key questions concerning copyright and authorship issues with generative models. Furthermore, we highlight the need for a comprehensive evaluation of creativity that is process-driven and considers several dimensions of creativity. Finally, we propose future research directions to improve the creativity of AI outputs, drawing inspiration from cognitive science and psychology.</description>

      <title>Path-based summary explanations for graph recommenders (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Path-based explanations provide intrinsic insights into graph-based recommendation models. However, most previous work has focused on explaining an individual recommendation of an item to a user. In this paper, we propose summary explanations, i.e., explanations that highlight why a user or a group of users receive a set of item recommendations and why an item, or a group of items, is recommended to a set of users as an effective means to provide insights into the collective behavior of the recommender. We also present a novel method to summarize explanations using efficient graph algorithms, specifically the Steiner Tree and the Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree. Our approach reduces the size and complexity of summary explanations while preserving essential information, making explanations more comprehensible for users and more useful to model developers. Evaluations across multiple metrics demonstrate that our summaries outperform baseline explanation methods in most scenarios, in a variety of quality aspects.</description>

      <title>From Novice to Expert: LLM Agent Policy Optimization via Step-wise Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The outstanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) render them a crucial component in various autonomous agent systems. While traditional methods depend on the inherent knowledge of LLMs without fine-tuning, more recent approaches have shifted toward the reinforcement learning strategy to further enhance agents' ability to solve complex interactive tasks with environments and tools. However, previous approaches are constrained by the sparse reward issue, where existing datasets solely provide a final scalar reward for each multi-step reasoning chain, potentially leading to ineffectiveness and inefficiency in policy learning. In this paper, we introduce StepAgent, which utilizes step-wise reward to optimize the agent's reinforcement learning process. Inheriting the spirit of novice-to-expert theory, we first compare the actions of the expert and the agent to automatically generate intermediate rewards for fine-grained optimization. Additionally, we propose implicit-reward and inverse reinforcement learning techniques to facilitate agent reflection and policy adjustment. Further theoretical analysis demonstrates that the action distribution of the agent can converge toward the expert action distribution over multiple training cycles. Experimental results across various datasets indicate that StepAgent outperforms existing baseline methods.</description>

      <title>DNN Task Assignment in UAV Networks: A Generative AI Enhanced Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) possess high mobility and flexible deployment capabilities, prompting the development of UAVs for various application scenarios within the Internet of Things (IoT). The unique capabilities of UAVs give rise to increasingly critical and complex tasks in uncertain and potentially harsh environments. The substantial amount of data generated from these applications necessitates processing and analysis through deep neural networks (DNNs). However, UAVs encounter challenges due to their limited computing resources when managing DNN models. This paper presents a joint approach that combines multiple-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and generative diffusion models (GDM) for assigning DNN tasks to a UAV swarm, aimed at reducing latency from task capture to result output. To address these challenges, we first consider the task size of the target area to be inspected and the shortest flying path as optimization constraints, employing a greedy algorithm to resolve the subproblem with a focus on minimizing the UAV's flying path and the overall system cost. In the second stage, we introduce a novel DNN task assignment algorithm, termed GDM-MADDPG, which utilizes the reverse denoising process of GDM to replace the actor network in multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG). This approach generates specific DNN task assignment actions based on agents' observations in a dynamic environment. Simulation results indicate that our algorithm performs favorably compared to benchmarks in terms of path planning, Age of Information (AoI), energy consumption, and task load balancing.</description>

      <title>TableTime: Reformulating Time Series Classification as Zero-Shot Table Understanding via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in multivariate time series classification (MTSC). Effective adaptation of LLMs for MTSC necessitates informative data representations. Existing LLM-based methods directly encode embeddings for time series within the latent space of LLMs from scratch to align with semantic space of LLMs. Despite their effectiveness, we reveal that these methods conceal three inherent bottlenecks: (1) they struggle to encode temporal and channel-specific information in a lossless manner, both of which are critical components of multivariate time series; (2) it is much difficult to align the learned representation space with the semantic space of the LLMs; (3) they require task-specific retraining, which is both computationally expensive and labor-intensive. To bridge these gaps, we propose TableTime, which reformulates MTSC as a table understanding task. Specifically, TableTime introduces the following strategies: (1) convert multivariate time series into a tabular form, thus minimizing information loss to the greatest extent; (2) represent tabular time series in text format to achieve natural alignment with the semantic space of LLMs; (3) design a reasoning framework that integrates contextual text information, neighborhood assistance, multi-path inference and problem decomposition to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs and realize zero-shot classification. Extensive experiments performed on 10 publicly representative datasets from UEA archive verify the superiorities of the TableTime.</description>

      <title>Predictive Models in Sequential Recommendations: Bridging Performance Laws with Data Quality Insights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00430v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential Recommendation (SR) plays a critical role in predicting users' sequential preferences. Despite its growing prominence in various industries, the increasing scale of SR models incurs substantial computational costs and unpredictability, challenging developers to manage resources efficiently. Under this predicament, Scaling Laws have achieved significant success by examining the loss as models scale up. However, there remains a disparity between loss and model performance, which is of greater concern in practical applications. Moreover, as data continues to expand, it incorporates repetitive and inefficient data. In response, we introduce the Performance Law for SR models, which aims to theoretically investigate and model the relationship between model performance and data quality. Specifically, we first fit the HR and NDCG metrics to transformer-based SR models. Subsequently, we propose Approximate Entropy (ApEn) to assess data quality, presenting a more nuanced approach compared to traditional data quantity metrics. Our method enables accurate predictions across various dataset scales and model sizes, demonstrating a strong correlation in large SR models and offering insights into achieving optimal performance for any given model configuration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the capabilities of code large language models (LLMs) continue to expand, their applications across diverse code intelligence domains are rapidly increasing. However, most existing datasets only evaluate limited application domains. To address this gap, we have developed a comprehensive code evaluation dataset FullStack Bench focusing on full-stack programming, which encompasses a wide range of application domains (e.g., basic programming, data analysis, software engineering, mathematics, and machine learning). Besides, to assess multilingual programming capabilities, in FullStack Bench, we design real-world instructions and corresponding unit test cases from 16 widely-used programming languages to reflect real-world usage scenarios rather than simple translations. Moreover, we also release an effective code sandbox execution tool (i.e., SandboxFusion) supporting various programming languages and packages to evaluate the performance of our FullStack Bench efficiently. Comprehensive experimental results on our FullStack Bench demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of our FullStack Bench and SandboxFusion.</description>

      <title>CPRM: A LLM-based Continual Pre-training Framework for Relevance Modeling in Commercial Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relevance modeling between queries and items stands as a pivotal component in commercial search engines, directly affecting the user experience. Given the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, LLM-based relevance modeling is gradually being adopted within industrial search systems. Nevertheless, foundational LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge and do not fully exploit the potential of in-context learning. Furthermore, structured item text remains underutilized, and there is a shortage in the supply of corresponding queries and background knowledge. We thereby propose CPRM (Continual Pre-training for Relevance Modeling), a framework designed for the continual pre-training of LLMs to address these issues. Our CPRM framework includes three modules: 1) employing both queries and multi-field item to jointly pre-train for enhancing domain knowledge, 2) applying in-context pre-training, a novel approach where LLMs are pre-trained on a sequence of related queries or items, and 3) conducting reading comprehension on items to produce associated domain knowledge and background information (e.g., generating summaries and corresponding queries) to further strengthen LLMs. Results on offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate that our model achieves convincing performance compared to strong baselines.</description>

      <title>MBA-RAG: a Bandit Approach for Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation through Question Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven to be highly effective in boosting the generative performance of language model in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG framework either indiscriminately perform retrieval or rely on rigid single-class classifiers to select retrieval methods, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance across queries of varying complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that dynamically selects the most suitable retrieval strategy based on query complexity. % our solution Our approach leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm, which treats each retrieval method as a distinct ``arm'' and adapts the selection process by balancing exploration and exploitation. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic reward function that balances accuracy and efficiency, penalizing methods that require more retrieval steps, even if they lead to a correct result. Our method achieves new state of the art results on multiple single-hop and multi-hop datasets while reducing retrieval costs.

      <title>Optimization of Transformer heart disease prediction model based on particle swarm optimization algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aiming at the latest particle swarm optimization algorithm, this paper proposes an improved Transformer model to improve the accuracy of heart disease prediction and provide a new algorithm idea. We first use three mainstream machine learning classification algorithms - decision tree, random forest and XGBoost, and then output the confusion matrix of these three models. The results showed that the random forest model had the best performance in predicting the classification of heart disease, with an accuracy of 92.2%. Then, we apply the Transformer model based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to the same dataset for classification experiment. The results show that the classification accuracy of the model is as high as 96.5%, 4.3 percentage points higher than that of random forest, which verifies the effectiveness of PSO in optimizing Transformer model. From the above research, we can see that particle swarm optimization significantly improves Transformer performance in heart disease prediction. Improving the ability to predict heart disease is a global priority with benefits for all humankind. Accurate prediction can enhance public health, optimize medical resources, and reduce healthcare costs, leading to healthier populations and more productive societies worldwide. This advancement paves the way for more efficient health management and supports the foundation of a healthier, more resilient global community.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning Based Docking Methods: Fair Comparisons to Conventional Docking Workflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffusion learning method, DiffDock, for docking small-molecule ligands into protein binding sites was recently introduced. Results included comparisons to more conventional docking approaches, with DiffDock showing superior performance. Here, we employ a fully automatic workflow using the Surflex-Dock methods to generate a fair baseline for conventional docking approaches. Results were generated for the common and expected situation where a binding site location is known and also for the condition of an unknown binding site. For the known binding site condition, Surflex-Dock success rates at 2.0 Angstroms RMSD far exceeded those for DiffDock (Top-1/Top-5 success rates, respectively, were 68/81% compared with 45/51%). Glide performed with similar success rates (67/73%) to Surflex-Dock for the known binding site condition, and results for AutoDock Vina and Gnina followed this pattern. For the unknown binding site condition, using an automated method to identify multiple binding pockets, Surflex-Dock success rates again exceeded those of DiffDock, but by a somewhat lesser margin. DiffDock made use of roughly 17,000 co-crystal structures for learning (98% of PDBBind version 2020, pre-2019 structures) for a training set in order to predict on 363 test cases (2% of PDBBind 2020) from 2019 forward. DiffDock's performance was inextricably linked with the presence of near-neighbor cases of close to identical protein-ligand complexes in the training set for over half of the test set cases. DiffDock exhibited a 40 percentage point difference on near-neighbor cases (two-thirds of all test cases) compared with cases with no near-neighbor training case. DiffDock has apparently encoded a type of table-lookup during its learning process, rendering meaningful applications beyond its reach. Further, it does not perform even close to competitively with a competently run modern docking workflow.</description>

Abstract: Recently, CLIP has become an important model for aligning images and text in multi-modal contexts. However, researchers have identified limitations in the ability of CLIP's text and image encoders to extract detailed knowledge from pairs of captions and images. In response, this paper presents Knowledge-CLIP, an innovative approach designed to improve CLIP's performance by integrating a new knowledge distillation (KD) method based on Llama 2. Our approach focuses on three key objectives: Text Embedding Distillation, Concept Learning, and Contrastive Learning. First, Text Embedding Distillation involves training the Knowledge-CLIP text encoder to mirror the teacher model, Llama 2. Next, Concept Learning assigns a soft concept label to each caption-image pair by employing offline K-means clustering on text data from Llama 2, enabling Knowledge-CLIP to learn from these soft concept labels. Lastly, Contrastive Learning aligns the text and image embeddings. Our experimental findings show that the proposed model improves the performance of both text and image encoders.</description>

      <title>Monet: Mixture of Monosemantic Experts for Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the internal computations of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for aligning them with human values and preventing undesirable behaviors like toxic content generation. However, mechanistic interpretability is hindered by polysemanticity -- where individual neurons respond to multiple, unrelated concepts. While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have attempted to disentangle these features through sparse dictionary learning, they have compromised LLM performance due to reliance on post-hoc reconstruction loss. To address this issue, we introduce Mixture of Monosemantic Experts for Transformers (Monet) architecture, which incorporates sparse dictionary learning directly into end-to-end Mixture-of-Experts pretraining. Our novel expert decomposition method enables scaling the expert count to 262,144 per layer while total parameters scale proportionally to the square root of the number of experts. Our analyses demonstrate mutual exclusivity of knowledge across experts and showcase the parametric knowledge encapsulated within individual experts. Moreover, Monet allows knowledge manipulation over domains, languages, and toxicity mitigation without degrading general performance. Our pursuit of transparent LLMs highlights the potential of scaling expert counts to enhance mechanistic interpretability and directly resect the internal knowledge to fundamentally adjust model behavior. The source code and pretrained checkpoints are available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/Monet.</description>

      <title>Enhancing FKG.in: automating Indian food composition analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to compute food composition data for Indian recipes using a knowledge graph for Indian food (FKG.in) and LLMs. The primary focus is to provide a broad overview of an automated food composition analysis workflow and describe its core functionalities: nutrition data aggregation, food composition analysis, and LLM-augmented information resolution. This workflow aims to complement FKG.in and iteratively supplement food composition data from verified knowledge bases. Additionally, this paper highlights the challenges of representing Indian food and accessing food composition data digitally. It also reviews three key sources of food composition data: the Indian Food Composition Tables, the Indian Nutrient Databank, and the Nutritionix API. Furthermore, it briefly outlines how users can interact with the workflow to obtain diet-based health recommendations and detailed food composition information for numerous recipes. We then explore the complex challenges of analyzing Indian recipe information across dimensions such as structure, multilingualism, and uncertainty as well as present our ongoing work on LLM-based solutions to address these issues. The methods proposed in this workshop paper for AI-driven knowledge curation and information resolution are application-agnostic, generalizable, and replicable for any domain.</description>

      <title>Neural Point Process for Learning Spatiotemporal Event Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.06351v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning the dynamics of spatiotemporal events is a fundamental problem. Neural point processes enhance the expressivity of point process models with deep neural networks. However, most existing methods only consider temporal dynamics without spatial modeling. We propose Deep Spatiotemporal Point Process (\ours{}), a deep dynamics model that integrates spatiotemporal point processes. Our method is flexible, efficient, and can accurately forecast irregularly sampled events over space and time. The key construction of our approach is the nonparametric space-time intensity function, governed by a latent process. The intensity function enjoys closed form integration for the density. The latent process captures the uncertainty of the event sequence. We use amortized variational inference to infer the latent process with deep networks. Using synthetic datasets, we validate our model can accurately learn the true intensity function. On real-world benchmark datasets, our model demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Our code and data can be found at the https://github.com/Rose-STL-Lab/DeepSTPP.</description>

      <title>Implications of Distance over Redistricting Maps: Central and Outlier Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.00872v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In representative democracy, a redistricting map is chosen to partition an electorate into districts which each elects a representative. A valid redistricting map must satisfy a collection of constraints such as being compact, contiguous, and of almost-equal population. However, these constraints are loose enough to enable an enormous ensemble of valid redistricting maps. This enables a partisan legislature to gerrymander by choosing a map which unfairly favors it. In this paper, we introduce an interpretable and tractable distance measure over redistricting maps which does not use election results and study its implications over the ensemble of redistricting maps. Specifically, we define a central map which may be considered "most typical" and give a rigorous justification for it by showing that it mirrors the Kemeny ranking in a scenario where we have a committee voting over a collection of redistricting maps to be drawn. We include running time and sample complexity analysis for our algorithms, including some negative results which hold using any algorithm. We further study outlier detection based on this distance measure and show that our framework can detect some gerrymandered maps. More precisely, we show some maps that are widely considered to be gerrymandered that lie very far away from our central maps in comparison to a large ensemble of valid redistricting maps. Since our distance measure does not rely on election results, this gives a significant advantage in gerrymandering detection which is lacking in all previous methods.</description>

      <title>Language Control Diffusion: Efficiently Scaling through Space, Time, and Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15629v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training generalist agents is difficult across several axes, requiring us to deal with high-dimensional inputs (space), long horizons (time), and generalization to novel tasks. Recent advances with architectures have allowed for improved scaling along one or two of these axes, but are still computationally prohibitive to use. In this paper, we propose to address all three axes by leveraging \textbf{L}anguage to \textbf{C}ontrol \textbf{D}iffusion models as a hierarchical planner conditioned on language (LCD). We effectively and efficiently scale diffusion models for planning in extended temporal, state, and task dimensions to tackle long horizon control problems conditioned on natural language instructions, as a step towards generalist agents. Comparing LCD with other state-of-the-art models on the CALVIN language robotics benchmark finds that LCD outperforms other SOTA methods in multi-task success rates, whilst improving inference speed over other comparable diffusion models by 3.3x~15x. We show that LCD can successfully leverage the unique strength of diffusion models to produce coherent long range plans while addressing their weakness in generating low-level details and control.</description>

      <title>Edge-free but Structure-aware: Prototype-Guided Knowledge Distillation from GNNs to MLPs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distilling high-accuracy Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to low-latency multilayer perceptions (MLPs) on graph tasks has become a hot research topic. However, conventional MLP learning relies almost exclusively on graph nodes and fails to effectively capture the graph structural information. Previous methods address this issue by processing graph edges into extra inputs for MLPs, but such graph structures may be unavailable for various scenarios. To this end, we propose Prototype-Guided Knowledge Distillation (PGKD), which does not require graph edges (edge-free setting) yet learns structure-aware MLPs. Our insight is to distill graph structural information from GNNs. Specifically, we first employ the class prototypes to analyze the impact of graph structures on GNN teachers, and then design two losses to distill such information from GNNs to MLPs. Experimental results on popular graph benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed PGKD.</description>

      <title>Challenges of learning multi-scale dynamics with AI weather models: Implications for stability and one solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-term stability and physical consistency are critical properties for AI-based weather models if they are going to be used for subseasonal-to-seasonal forecasts or beyond, e.g., climate change projection. However, current AI-based weather models can only provide short-term forecasts accurately since they become unstable or physically inconsistent when time-integrated beyond a few weeks or a few months. Either they exhibit numerical blow-up or hallucinate unrealistic dynamics of the atmospheric variables, akin to the current class of autoregressive large language models. The cause of the instabilities is unknown, and the methods that are used to improve their stability horizons are ad-hoc and lack rigorous theory. In this paper, we reveal that the universal causal mechanism for these instabilities in any turbulent flow is due to \textit{spectral bias} wherein, \textit{any} deep learning architecture is biased to learn only the large-scale dynamics and ignores the small scales completely. We further elucidate how turbulence physics and the absence of convergence in deep learning-based time-integrators amplify this bias, leading to unstable error propagation. Finally, using the quasi-geostrophic flow and European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) Reanalysis data as test cases, we bridge the gap between deep learning theory and numerical analysis to propose one mitigative solution to such unphysical behavior. We develop long-term physically-consistent data-driven models for the climate system and demonstrate accurate short-term forecasts, and hundreds of years of time-integration with accurate mean and variability.</description>

      <title>Using Offline Data to Speed Up Reinforcement Learning in Procedurally Generated Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the key challenges of Reinforcement Learning (RL) is the ability of agents to generalise their learned policy to unseen settings. Moreover, training RL agents requires large numbers of interactions with the environment. Motivated by the recent success of Offline RL and Imitation Learning (IL), we conduct a study to investigate whether agents can leverage offline data in the form of trajectories to improve the sample-efficiency in procedurally generated environments. We consider two settings of using IL from offline data for RL: (1) pre-training a policy before online RL training and (2) concurrently training a policy with online RL and IL from offline data. We analyse the impact of the quality (optimality of trajectories) and diversity (number of trajectories and covered level) of available offline trajectories on the effectiveness of both approaches. Across four well-known sparse reward tasks in the MiniGrid environment, we find that using IL for pre-training and concurrently during online RL training both consistently improve the sample-efficiency while converging to optimal policies. Furthermore, we show that pre-training a policy from as few as two trajectories can make the difference between learning an optimal policy at the end of online training and not learning at all. Our findings motivate the widespread adoption of IL for pre-training and concurrent IL in procedurally generated environments whenever offline trajectories are available or can be generated.</description>

      <title>Optimal partition of feature using Bayesian classifier</title>

Abstract: The Naive Bayesian classifier is a popular classification method employing the Bayesian paradigm. The concept of having conditional dependence among input variables sounds good in theory but can lead to a majority vote style behaviour. Achieving conditional independence is often difficult, and they introduce decision biases in the estimates. In Naive Bayes, certain features are called independent features as they have no conditional correlation or dependency when predicting a classification. In this paper, we focus on the optimal partition of features by proposing a novel technique called the Comonotone-Independence Classifier (CIBer) which is able to overcome the challenges posed by the Naive Bayes method. For different datasets, we clearly demonstrate the efficacy of our technique, where we achieve lower error rates and higher or equivalent accuracy compared to models such as Random Forests and XGBoost.</description>

      <title>Assessing the potential of LLM-assisted annotation for corpus-based pragmatics and discourse analysis: The case of apology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08339v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Certain forms of linguistic annotation, like part of speech and semantic tagging, can be automated with high accuracy. However, manual annotation is still necessary for complex pragmatic and discursive features that lack a direct mapping to lexical forms. This manual process is time-consuming and error-prone, limiting the scalability of function-to-form approaches in corpus linguistics. To address this, our study explores the possibility of using large language models (LLMs) to automate pragma-discursive corpus annotation. We compare GPT-3.5 (the model behind the free-to-use version of ChatGPT), GPT-4 (the model underpinning the precise mode of Bing chatbot), and a human coder in annotating apology components in English based on the local grammar framework. We find that GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5, with accuracy approaching that of a human coder. These results suggest that LLMs can be successfully deployed to aid pragma-discursive corpus annotation, making the process more efficient, scalable and accessible.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a statistical framework of using artificial intelligence to improve human decision making. The performance of each human decision maker is benchmarked against that of machine predictions. We replace the diagnoses made by a subset of the decision makers with the recommendation from the machine learning algorithm. We apply both a heuristic frequentist approach and a Bayesian posterior loss function approach to abnormal birth detection using a nationwide dataset of doctor diagnoses from prepregnancy checkups of reproductive age couples and pregnancy outcomes. We find that our algorithm on a test dataset results in a higher overall true positive rate and a lower false positive rate than the diagnoses made by doctors only.</description>

      <title>Split and Merge: Aligning Position Biases in LLM-based Evaluators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise as automated evaluators for assessing the quality of answers generated by AI systems. However, these LLM-based evaluators exhibit position bias, or inconsistency, when used to evaluate candidate answers in pairwise comparisons, favoring either the first or second answer regardless of content. To address this limitation, we propose PORTIA, an alignment-based system designed to mimic human comparison strategies to calibrate position bias in a lightweight yet effective manner. Specifically, PORTIA splits the answers into multiple segments, aligns similar content across candidate answers, and then merges them back into a single prompt for evaluation by LLMs. We conducted extensive experiments with six diverse LLMs to evaluate 11,520 answer pairs. Our results show that PORTIA markedly enhances the consistency rates for all the models and comparison forms tested, achieving an average relative improvement of 47.46%. Remarkably, PORTIA enables less advanced GPT models to achieve 88% agreement with the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model at just 10% of the cost. Furthermore, it rectifies around 80% of the position bias instances within the GPT-4 model, elevating its consistency rate up to 98%. Subsequent human evaluations indicate that the PORTIA-enhanced GPT-3.5 model can even surpass the standalone GPT-4 in terms of alignment with human evaluators. These findings highlight PORTIA's ability to correct position bias, improve LLM consistency, and boost performance while keeping cost-efficiency. This represents a valuable step toward a more reliable and scalable use of LLMs for automated evaluations across diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Domain Generalization for Medical Image Analysis: A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical image analysis (MedIA) has become an essential tool in medicine and healthcare, aiding in disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning, and recent successes in deep learning (DL) have made significant contributions to its advances. However, deploying DL models for MedIA in real-world situations remains challenging due to their failure to generalize across the distributional gap between training and testing samples - a problem known as domain shift. Researchers have dedicated their efforts to developing various DL methods to adapt and perform robustly on unknown and out-of-distribution (OOD) data distributions. This article comprehensively reviews domain generalization (DG) studies specifically tailored for MedIA. We provide a holistic view of how DG techniques interact within the broader MedIA system, going beyond methodologies to consider the operational implications on the entire MedIA workflow. Specifically, we categorize DG methods into data-level, feature-level, model-level, and analysis-level methods. We show how those methods can be used in various stages of the MedIA workflow with DL equipped from data acquisition to model prediction and analysis. Furthermore, we critically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of various methods, unveiling future research opportunities.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Quantum Reinforcement Learning using Evolutionary Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning is becoming increasingly more important in times of autonomous driving and other smart industrial applications. Simultaneously a promising new approach to Reinforcement Learning arises using the inherent properties of quantum mechanics, reducing the trainable parameters of a model significantly. However, gradient-based Multi-Agent Quantum Reinforcement Learning methods often have to struggle with barren plateaus, holding them back from matching the performance of classical approaches. We build upon an existing approach for gradient free Quantum Reinforcement Learning and propose three genetic variations with Variational Quantum Circuits for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning using evolutionary optimization. We evaluate our genetic variations in the Coin Game environment and also compare them to classical approaches. We showed that our Variational Quantum Circuit approaches perform significantly better compared to a neural network with a similar amount of trainable parameters. Compared to the larger neural network, our approaches archive similar results using $97.88\%$ less parameters.</description>

      <title>GeoSAM: Fine-tuning SAM with Multi-Modal Prompts for Mobility Infrastructure Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In geographical image segmentation, performance is often constrained by the limited availability of training data and a lack of generalizability, particularly for segmenting mobility infrastructure such as roads, sidewalks, and crosswalks. Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pre-trained on millions of natural images, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot segmentation performance, providing a potential solution. However, SAM struggles with geographical images, such as aerial and satellite imagery, due to its training being confined to natural images and the narrow features and textures of these objects blending into their surroundings. To address these challenges, we propose Geographical SAM (GeoSAM), a SAM-based framework that fine-tunes SAM with automatically generated multi-modal prompts, combining point prompts from a pre-trained task-specific model as primary visual guidance and text prompts from a large language model as secondary semantic guidance to enhance model comprehension. GeoSAM outperforms existing approaches for mobility infrastructure segmentation in both familiar and completely unseen regions by at least 5\% in mIoU, representing a significant leap in leveraging foundation models to segment mobility infrastructure, including both road and pedestrian infrastructure in geographical images.

      <title>Enhancing Scene Graph Generation with Hierarchical Relationships and Commonsense Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12889v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces an enhanced approach to generating scene graphs by incorporating both a relationship hierarchy and commonsense knowledge. Specifically, we begin by proposing a hierarchical relation head that exploits an informative hierarchical structure. It jointly predicts the relation super-category between object pairs in an image, along with detailed relations under each super-category. Following this, we implement a robust commonsense validation pipeline that harnesses foundation models to critique the results from the scene graph prediction system, removing nonsensical predicates even with a small language-only model. Extensive experiments on Visual Genome and OpenImage V6 datasets demonstrate that the proposed modules can be seamlessly integrated as plug-and-play enhancements to existing scene graph generation algorithms. The results show significant improvements with an extensive set of reasonable predictions beyond dataset annotations. Codes are available at https://github.com/bowen-upenn/scene_graph_commonsense.</description>

      <title>Can Multimodal Large Language Models Truly Perform Multimodal In-Context Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with in-context learning (ICL) ability can quickly adapt to a specific context given a few demonstrations (demos). Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) built upon LLMs have also shown multimodal ICL ability, i.e., responding to queries given a few multimodal demos, including images, queries, and answers. While ICL has been extensively studied on LLMs, its research on MLLMs remains limited. One essential question is whether these MLLMs can truly conduct multimodal ICL, or if only the textual modality is necessary. We investigate this question by examining two primary factors that influence ICL: 1) Demo content, i.e., understanding the influences of demo content in different modalities. 2) Demo selection strategy, i.e., how to select better multimodal demos for improved performance. Experiments revealed that multimodal ICL is predominantly driven by the textual content whereas the visual information in the demos has little influence. Interestingly, visual content is still necessary and useful for selecting demos to increase performance. Motivated by our analysis, we propose a simple yet effective approach, termed Mixed Modality In-Context Example Selection (MMICES), which considers both visual and language modalities when selecting demos. Extensive experiments are conducted to support our findings and verify the improvement brought by our method. Code is available at \url{https://chenxshuo.github.io/m-icl/}.</description>

      <title>Paloma: A Benchmark for Evaluating Language Model Fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluations of language models (LMs) commonly report perplexity on monolithic data held out from training. Implicitly or explicitly, this data is composed of domains--varying distributions of language. We introduce Perplexity Analysis for Language Model Assessment (Paloma), a benchmark to measure LM fit to 546 English and code domains, instead of assuming perplexity on one distribution extrapolates to others. We include two new datasets of the top 100 subreddits (e.g., r/depression on Reddit) and programming languages (e.g., Java on GitHub), both sources common in contemporary LMs. With our benchmark, we release 6 baseline 1B LMs carefully controlled to provide fair comparisons about which pretraining corpus is best and code for others to apply those controls to their own experiments. Our case studies demonstrate how the fine-grained results from Paloma surface findings such as that models pretrained without data beyond Common Crawl exhibit anomalous gaps in LM fit to many domains or that loss is dominated by the most frequently occurring strings in the vocabulary.</description>

      <title>Learning a Diffusion Model Policy from Rewards via Q-Score Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11752v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become a popular choice for representing actor policies in behavior cloning and offline reinforcement learning. This is due to their natural ability to optimize an expressive class of distributions over a continuous space. However, previous works fail to exploit the score-based structure of diffusion models, and instead utilize a simple behavior cloning term to train the actor, limiting their ability in the actor-critic setting. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework linking the structure of diffusion model policies to a learned Q-function, by linking the structure between the score of the policy to the action gradient of the Q-function. We focus on off-policy reinforcement learning and propose a new policy update method from this theory, which we denote Q-score matching. Notably, this algorithm only needs to differentiate through the denoising model rather than the entire diffusion model evaluation, and converged policies through Q-score matching are implicitly multi-modal and explorative in continuous domains. We conduct experiments in simulated environments to demonstrate the viability of our proposed method and compare to popular baselines.

      <title>A Prompt Learning Framework for Source Code Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (Source) code summarization is the task of automatically generating natural language summaries (also called comments) for given code snippets. Recently, with the successful application of large language models (LLMs) in numerous fields, software engineering researchers have also attempted to adapt LLMs to solve code summarization tasks. The main adaptation schemes include instruction prompting, task-oriented (full-parameter) fine-tuning, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However, instruction prompting involves designing crafted prompts and requires users to have professional domain knowledge, while task-oriented fine-tuning requires high training costs, and effective, tailored PEFT methods for code summarization are still lacking.
  This paper proposes an effective prompt learning framework for code summarization called PromptCS. It no longer requires users to rack their brains to design effective prompts. Instead, PromptCS trains a prompt agent that can generate continuous prompts to unleash the potential for LLMs in code summarization. Compared to the human-written discrete prompt, the continuous prompts are produced under the guidance of LLMs and are therefore easier to understand by LLMs. PromptCS is non-invasive to LLMs and freezes the parameters of LLMs when training the prompt agent, which can greatly reduce the requirements for training resources. Our comprehensive experimental results show that PromptCS significantly outperforms instruction prompting schemes (including zero-shot learning and few-shot learning) on all four widely used metrics, and is comparable to the task-oriented fine-tuning scheme. In some base LLMs, e.g., StarCoderBase-1B and -3B, PromptCS even outperforms the task-oriented fine-tuning scheme. More importantly, the training efficiency of PromptCS is faster than the task-oriented fine-tuning scheme, with a more pronounced advantage on larger LLMs.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Model-based, Policy-based, and Value-based Reinforcement Learning via the Lens of Representation Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) encompasses diverse paradigms, including model-based RL, policy-based RL, and value-based RL, each tailored to approximate the model, optimal policy, and optimal value function, respectively. This work investigates the potential hierarchy of representation complexity -- the complexity of functions to be represented -- among these RL paradigms. We first demonstrate that, for a broad class of Markov decision processes (MDPs), the model can be represented by constant-depth circuits with polynomial size or Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with constant layers and polynomial hidden dimension. However, the representation of the optimal policy and optimal value proves to be $\mathsf{NP}$-complete and unattainable by constant-layer MLPs with polynomial size. This demonstrates a significant representation complexity gap between model-based RL and model-free RL, which includes policy-based RL and value-based RL. To further explore the representation complexity hierarchy between policy-based RL and value-based RL, we introduce another general class of MDPs where both the model and optimal policy can be represented by constant-depth circuits with polynomial size or constant-layer MLPs with polynomial size. In contrast, representing the optimal value is $\mathsf{P}$-complete and intractable via a constant-layer MLP with polynomial hidden dimension. This accentuates the intricate representation complexity associated with value-based RL compared to policy-based RL. In summary, we unveil a potential representation complexity hierarchy within RL -- representing the model emerges as the easiest task, followed by the optimal policy, while representing the optimal value function presents the most intricate challenge.</description>

      <title>xTrimoPGLM: Unified 100B-Scale Pre-trained Transformer for Deciphering the Language of Protein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein language models have shown remarkable success in learning biological information from protein sequences. However, most existing models are limited by either autoencoding or autoregressive pre-training objectives, which makes them struggle to handle protein understanding and generation tasks concurrently. We propose a unified protein language model, xTrimoPGLM, to address these two types of tasks simultaneously through an innovative pre-training framework. Our key technical contribution is an exploration of the compatibility and the potential for joint optimization of the two types of objectives, which has led to a strategy for training xTrimoPGLM at an unprecedented scale of 100 billion parameters and 1 trillion training tokens. Our extensive experiments reveal that 1) xTrimoPGLM significantly outperforms other advanced baselines in 18 protein understanding benchmarks across four categories. The model also facilitates an atomic-resolution view of protein structures, leading to an advanced 3D structural prediction model that surpasses existing language model-based tools. 2) xTrimoPGLM not only can generate de novo protein sequences following the principles of natural ones, but also can perform programmable generation after supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on curated sequences. These results highlight the substantial capability and versatility of xTrimoPGLM in understanding and generating protein sequences, contributing to the evolving landscape of foundation models in protein science.</description>

      <title>Crowdsourced Adaptive Surveys</title>

Abstract: Public opinion surveys are vital for informing democratic decision-making, but responding to rapidly evolving information environments and measuring beliefs within niche communities can be challenging for traditional survey methods. This paper introduces a crowdsourced adaptive survey methodology (CSAS) that unites advances in natural language processing and adaptive algorithms to generate question banks that evolve with user input. The CSAS method converts open-ended text provided by participants into survey items and applies a multi-armed bandit algorithm to determine which questions should be prioritized in the survey. The method's adaptive nature allows for the exploration of new survey questions, while imposing minimal costs in survey length. Applications in the domains of Latino information environments, national issue importance, and local politics showcase CSAS's ability to identify topics that might otherwise escape the notice of survey researchers. I conclude by highlighting CSAS's potential to bridge conceptual gaps between researchers and participants in survey research.</description>

      <title>ZS4C: Zero-Shot Synthesis of Compilable Code for Incomplete Code Snippets using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Technical Q&amp;A sites are valuable for software developers seeking knowledge, but the code snippets they provide are often uncompilable and incomplete due to unresolved types and missing libraries. This poses a challenge for users who wish to reuse or analyze these snippets. Existing methods either do not focus on creating compilable code or have low success rates. To address this, we propose ZS4C, a lightweight approach for zero-shot synthesis of compilable code from incomplete snippets using Large Language Models (LLMs). ZS4C operates in two stages: first, it uses an LLM, like GPT-3.5, to identify missing import statements in a snippet; second, it collaborates with a validator (e.g., compiler) to fix compilation errors caused by incorrect imports and syntax issues. We evaluated ZS4C on the StatType-SO benchmark and a new dataset, Python-SO, which includes 539 Python snippets from Stack Overflow across the 20 most popular Python libraries. ZS4C significantly outperforms existing methods, improving the compilation rate from 63% to 95.1% compared to the state-of-the-art SnR, marking a 50.1% improvement. On average, ZS4C can infer more accurate import statements (with an F1 score of 0.98) than SnR, with an improvement of 8.5% in the F1.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02441v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce TopoX, a Python software suite that provides reliable and user-friendly building blocks for computing and machine learning on topological domains that extend graphs: hypergraphs, simplicial, cellular, path and combinatorial complexes. TopoX consists of three packages: TopoNetX facilitates constructing and computing on these domains, including working with nodes, edges and higher-order cells; TopoEmbedX provides methods to embed topological domains into vector spaces, akin to popular graph-based embedding algorithms such as node2vec; TopoModelX is built on top of PyTorch and offers a comprehensive toolbox of higher-order message passing functions for neural networks on topological domains. The extensively documented and unit-tested source code of TopoX is available under MIT license at https://pyt-team.github.io/}{https://pyt-team.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Personalized Language Modeling from Personalized Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalized large language models (LLMs) are designed to tailor responses to individual user preferences. While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a commonly used framework for aligning LLMs with human preferences, vanilla RLHF assumes that all human preferences share the same distribution, preventing fine-tuned LLMs from generating personalized content when user preferences are diverse. In this work, we propose Personalized-RLHF (P-RLHF), an efficient framework that utilizes a lightweight user model to capture individual user preferences and jointly learns the user model and the personalized LLM from human feedback. P-RLHF exhibits the following three characteristics: (1) It enables an LLM to generate personalized content and scale efficiently with growing number of users. (2) It handles both explicit user preferences described as textual input and implicit user preferences encoded in the feedback data. (3) It eliminates the need for users to fully articulate their preferences, which are normally needed for prompting LLMs to generate personalized content yet are often impractical to obtain in real-world scenarios. Our experimental results show that personalized LLMs trained using P-RLHF generate responses that are more closely aligned with individual user preferences, outperforming vanilla, non-personalized RLHF and prompting-based personalization approaches across different tasks. We opensource our code at https://github.com/HumainLab/Personalized_RLHF.</description>

      <title>CIC: A Framework for Culturally-Aware Image Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05374v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image Captioning generates descriptive sentences from images using Vision-Language Pre-trained models (VLPs) such as BLIP, which has improved greatly. However, current methods lack the generation of detailed descriptive captions for the cultural elements depicted in the images, such as the traditional clothing worn by people from Asian cultural groups. In this paper, we propose a new framework, Culturally-aware Image Captioning (CIC), that generates captions and describes cultural elements extracted from cultural visual elements in images representing cultures. Inspired by methods combining visual modality and Large Language Models (LLMs) through appropriate prompts, our framework (1) generates questions based on cultural categories from images, (2) extracts cultural visual elements from Visual Question Answering (VQA) using generated questions, and (3) generates culturally-aware captions using LLMs with the prompts. Our human evaluation conducted on 45 participants from 4 different cultural groups with a high understanding of the corresponding culture shows that our proposed framework generates more culturally descriptive captions when compared to the image captioning baseline based on VLPs.

      <title>InkSight: Offline-to-Online Handwriting Conversion by Learning to Read and Write</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05804v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital note-taking is gaining popularity, offering a durable, editable, and easily indexable way of storing notes in a vectorized form, known as digital ink. However, a substantial gap remains between this way of note-taking and traditional pen-and-paper note-taking, a practice that is still favored by a vast majority. Our work InkSight, aims to bridge the gap by empowering physical note-takers to effortlessly convert their work (offline handwriting) to digital ink (online handwriting), a process we refer to as derendering. Prior research on the topic has focused on the geometric properties of images, resulting in limited generalization beyond their training domains. Our approach combines reading and writing priors, allowing training a model in the absence of large amounts of paired samples, which are difficult to obtain. To our knowledge, this is the first work that effectively derenders handwritten text in arbitrary photos with diverse visual characteristics and backgrounds. Furthermore, it generalizes beyond its training domain into simple sketches. Our human evaluation reveals that 87% of the samples produced by our model on the challenging HierText dataset are considered as a valid tracing of the input image and 67% look like a pen trajectory traced by a human.</description>

      <title>Explainable Adversarial Learning Framework on Physical Layer Secret Keys Combating Malicious Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) can both help and hinder the physical layer secret key generation (PL-SKG) of communications systems. Whilst a legitimate RIS can yield beneficial impacts, including increased channel randomness to enhance PL-SKG, a malicious RIS can poison legitimate channels and crack almost all existing PL-SKGs. In this work, we propose an adversarial learning framework that addresses Man-in-the-middle RIS (MITM-RIS) eavesdropping which can exist between legitimate parties, namely Alice and Bob. First, the theoretical mutual information gap between legitimate pairs and MITM-RIS is deduced. From this, Alice and Bob leverage adversarial learning to learn a common feature space that assures no mutual information overlap with MITM-RIS. Next, to explain the trained legitimate common feature generator, we aid signal processing interpretation of black-box neural networks using a symbolic explainable AI (xAI) representation. These symbolic terms of dominant neurons aid the engineering of feature designs and the validation of the learned common feature space. Simulation results show that our proposed adversarial learning- and symbolic-based PL-SKGs can achieve high key agreement rates between legitimate users, and is further resistant to an MITM-RIS Eve with the full knowledge of legitimate feature generation (NNs or formulas). This therefore paves the way to secure wireless communications with untrusted reflective devices in future 6G.</description>

      <title>Learning Interpretable Concepts: Unifying Causal Representation Learning and Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To build intelligent machine learning systems, there are two broad approaches. One approach is to build inherently interpretable models, as endeavored by the growing field of causal representation learning. The other approach is to build highly-performant foundation models and then invest efforts into understanding how they work. In this work, we relate these two approaches and study how to learn human-interpretable concepts from data. Weaving together ideas from both fields, we formally define a notion of concepts and show that they can be provably recovered from diverse data. Experiments on synthetic data and large language models show the utility of our unified approach.</description>

      <title>ChemReasoner: Heuristic Search over a Large Language Model's Knowledge Space using Quantum-Chemical Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10980v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of new catalysts is essential for the design of new and more efficient chemical processes in order to transition to a sustainable future. We introduce an AI-guided computational screening framework unifying linguistic reasoning with quantum-chemistry based feedback from 3D atomistic representations. Our approach formulates catalyst discovery as an uncertain environment where an agent actively searches for highly effective catalysts via the iterative combination of large language model (LLM)-derived hypotheses and atomistic graph neural network (GNN)-derived feedback. Identified catalysts in intermediate search steps undergo structural evaluation based on spatial orientation, reaction pathways, and stability. Scoring functions based on adsorption energies and reaction energy barriers steer the exploration in the LLM's knowledge space toward energetically favorable, high-efficiency catalysts. We introduce planning methods that automatically guide the exploration without human input, providing competitive performance against expert-enumerated chemical descriptor-based implementations. By integrating language-guided reasoning with computational chemistry feedback, our work pioneers AI-accelerated, trustworthy catalyst discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown it is possible to construct adversarial examples that cause an aligned language model to emit harmful strings or perform harmful behavior. Existing attacks work either in the white-box setting (with full access to the model weights), or through transferability: the phenomenon that adversarial examples crafted on one model often remain effective on other models. We improve on prior work with a query-based attack that leverages API access to a remote language model to construct adversarial examples that cause the model to emit harmful strings with (much) higher probability than with transfer-only attacks. We validate our attack on GPT-3.5 and OpenAI's safety classifier; we can cause GPT-3.5 to emit harmful strings that current transfer attacks fail at, and we can evade the safety classifier with nearly 100% probability.</description>

      <title>RealDex: Towards Human-like Grasping for Robotic Dexterous Hand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce RealDex, a pioneering dataset capturing authentic dexterous hand grasping motions infused with human behavioral patterns, enriched by multi-view and multimodal visual data. Utilizing a teleoperation system, we seamlessly synchronize human-robot hand poses in real time. This collection of human-like motions is crucial for training dexterous hands to mimic human movements more naturally and precisely. RealDex holds immense promise in advancing humanoid robot for automated perception, cognition, and manipulation in real-world scenarios. Moreover, we introduce a cutting-edge dexterous grasping motion generation framework, which aligns with human experience and enhances real-world applicability through effectively utilizing Multimodal Large Language Models. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superior performance of our method on RealDex and other open datasets. The complete dataset and code will be made available upon the publication of this work.</description>

      <title>ToMBench: Benchmarking Theory of Mind in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) is the cognitive capability to perceive and ascribe mental states to oneself and others. Recent research has sparked a debate over whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit a form of ToM. However, existing ToM evaluations are hindered by challenges such as constrained scope, subjective judgment, and unintended contamination, yielding inadequate assessments. To address this gap, we introduce ToMBench with three key characteristics: a systematic evaluation framework encompassing 8 tasks and 31 abilities in social cognition, a multiple-choice question format to support automated and unbiased evaluation, and a build-from-scratch bilingual inventory to strictly avoid data leakage. Based on ToMBench, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the ToM performance of 10 popular LLMs across tasks and abilities. We find that even the most advanced LLMs like GPT-4 lag behind human performance by over 10% points, indicating that LLMs have not achieved a human-level theory of mind yet. Our aim with ToMBench is to enable an efficient and effective evaluation of LLMs' ToM capabilities, thereby facilitating the development of LLMs with inherent social intelligence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18659v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen an explosive increase in research on large language models (LLMs), and accompanying public engagement on the topic. While starting as a niche area within natural language processing, LLMs have shown remarkable potential across a broad range of applications and domains, including games. This paper surveys the current state of the art across the various applications of LLMs in and for games, and identifies the different roles LLMs can take within a game. Importantly, we discuss underexplored areas and promising directions for future uses of LLMs in games and we reconcile the potential and limitations of LLMs within the games domain. As the first comprehensive survey and roadmap at the intersection of LLMs and games, we are hopeful that this paper will serve as the basis for groundbreaking research and innovation in this exciting new field.</description>

      <title>Remove that Square Root: A New Efficient Scale-Invariant Version of AdaGrad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive methods are extremely popular in machine learning as they make learning rate tuning less expensive. This paper introduces a novel optimization algorithm named KATE, which presents a scale-invariant adaptation of the well-known AdaGrad algorithm. We prove the scale-invariance of KATE for the case of Generalized Linear Models. Moreover, for general smooth non-convex problems, we establish a convergence rate of $O \left(\frac{\log T}{\sqrt{T}} \right)$ for KATE, matching the best-known ones for AdaGrad and Adam. We also compare KATE to other state-of-the-art adaptive algorithms Adam and AdaGrad in numerical experiments with different problems, including complex machine learning tasks like image classification and text classification on real data. The results indicate that KATE consistently outperforms AdaGrad and matches/surpasses the performance of Adam in all considered scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Dataset and Benchmark for Hospital Course Summarization with Adapted Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brief hospital course (BHC) summaries are clinical documents that summarize a patient's hospital stay. While large language models (LLMs) depict remarkable capabilities in automating real-world tasks, their capabilities for healthcare applications such as synthesizing BHCs from clinical notes have not been shown. We introduce a novel pre-processed dataset, the MIMIC-IV-BHC, encapsulating clinical note and brief hospital course (BHC) pairs to adapt LLMs for BHC synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce a benchmark of the summarization performance of two general-purpose LLMs and three healthcare-adapted LLMs. Using clinical notes as input, we apply prompting-based (using in-context learning) and fine-tuning-based adaptation strategies to three open-source LLMs (Clinical-T5-Large, Llama2-13B, FLAN-UL2) and two proprietary LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4). We evaluate these LLMs across multiple context-length inputs using natural language similarity metrics. We further conduct a clinical study with five clinicians, comparing clinician-written and LLM-generated BHCs across 30 samples, focusing on their potential to enhance clinical decision-making through improved summary quality. We observe that the Llama2-13B fine-tuned LLM outperforms other domain-adapted models given quantitative evaluation metrics of BLEU and BERT-Score. GPT-4 with in-context learning shows more robustness to increasing context lengths of clinical note inputs than fine-tuned Llama2-13B. Despite comparable quantitative metrics, the reader study depicts a significant preference for summaries generated by GPT-4 with in-context learning compared to both Llama2-13B fine-tuned summaries and the original summaries, highlighting the need for qualitative clinical evaluation.</description>

      <title>Can tweets predict article retractions? A comparison between human and LLM labelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quickly detecting problematic research articles is crucial to safeguarding the integrity of scientific research. This study explores whether Twitter mentions of retracted articles can signal potential problems with the articles prior to their retraction, potentially serving as an early warning system for scholars. To investigate this, we analysed a dataset of 4,354 Twitter mentions associated with 504 retracted articles. The effectiveness of Twitter mentions in predicting article retractions was evaluated by both manual and Large Language Model (LLM) labelling. Manual labelling results indicated that 25.7% of tweets signalled problems before retraction. Using the manual labelling results as the baseline, we found that LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and Claude-3.5-Haiku) outperformed lexicon-based sentiment analysis tools (e.g., TextBlob) in detecting potential problems, suggesting that automatic detection of problematic articles from social media using LLMs is technically feasible. Nevertheless, since only a small proportion of retracted articles (11.1%) were criticised on Twitter prior to retraction, such automatic systems would detect only a minority of problematic articles. Overall, this study offers insights into how social media data, coupled with emerging generative AI techniques, can support research integrity.</description>

      <title>Automated Black-box Prompt Engineering for Personalized Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prompt engineering is effective for controlling the output of text-to-image (T2I) generative models, but it is also laborious due to the need for manually crafted prompts. This challenge has spurred the development of algorithms for automated prompt generation. However, these methods often struggle with transferability across T2I models, require white-box access to the underlying model, and produce non-intuitive prompts. In this work, we introduce PRISM, an algorithm that automatically identifies human-interpretable and transferable prompts that can effectively generate desired concepts given only black-box access to T2I models. Inspired by large language model (LLM) jailbreaking, PRISM leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs to iteratively refine the candidate prompts distribution for given reference images. Our experiments demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of PRISM in generating accurate prompts for objects, styles and images across multiple T2I models, including Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and Midjourney.</description>

      <title>Croissant: A Metadata Format for ML-Ready Datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data is a critical resource for machine learning (ML), yet working with data remains a key friction point. This paper introduces Croissant, a metadata format for datasets that creates a shared representation across ML tools, frameworks, and platforms. Croissant makes datasets more discoverable, portable, and interoperable, thereby addressing significant challenges in ML data management. Croissant is already supported by several popular dataset repositories, spanning hundreds of thousands of datasets, enabling easy loading into the most commonly-used ML frameworks, regardless of where the data is stored. Our initial evaluation by human raters shows that Croissant metadata is readable, understandable, complete, yet concise.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Multilingual Large Language Models: Corpora, Alignment, and Bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the foundation of Large Language Models (LLMs), Multilingual LLMs (MLLMs) have been developed to address the challenges faced in multilingual natural language processing, hoping to achieve knowledge transfer from high-resource languages to low-resource languages. However, significant limitations and challenges still exist, such as language imbalance, multilingual alignment, and inherent bias. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of MLLMs, delving deeply into discussions surrounding these critical issues. First of all, we start by presenting an overview of MLLMs, covering their evolutions, key techniques, and multilingual capacities. Secondly, we explore the multilingual training corpora of MLLMs and the multilingual datasets oriented for downstream tasks that are crucial to enhance the cross-lingual capability of MLLMs. Thirdly, we survey the state-of-the-art studies of multilingual representations and investigate whether the current MLLMs can learn a universal language representation. Fourthly, we discuss bias on MLLMs, including its categories, evaluation metrics, and debiasing techniques. Finally, we discuss existing challenges and point out promising research directions of MLLMs.</description>

      <title>SpiKernel: A Kernel Size Exploration Methodology for Improving Accuracy of the Embedded Spiking Neural Network Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) can offer ultra-low power/energy consumption for machine learning-based application tasks due to their sparse spike-based operations. Currently, most of the SNN architectures need a significantly larger model size to achieve higher accuracy, which is not suitable for resource-constrained embedded applications. Therefore, developing SNNs that can achieve high accuracy with acceptable memory footprint is highly needed. Toward this, we propose SpiKernel, a novel methodology that improves the accuracy of SNNs through kernel size exploration. Its key steps include (1) investigating the impact of different kernel sizes on the accuracy, (2) devising new sets of kernel sizes, (3) generating SNN architectures using neural architecture search based on the selected kernel sizes, and (4) analyzing the accuracy-memory trade-offs for SNN model selection. The experimental results show that our SpiKernel achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art works (i.e., 93.24% for CIFAR10, 70.84% for CIFAR100, and 62% for TinyImageNet) with less than 10M parameters and up to 4.8x speed-up of searching time, thereby making it suitable for embedded applications.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Kullback-Leibler Divergence in Knowledge Distillation for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02657v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kullback-Leiber divergence has been widely used in Knowledge Distillation (KD) to compress Large Language Models (LLMs). Contrary to prior assertions that reverse Kullback-Leibler (RKL) divergence is mode-seeking and thus preferable over the mean-seeking forward Kullback-Leibler (FKL) divergence, this study empirically and theoretically demonstrates that neither mode-seeking nor mean-seeking properties manifest in KD for LLMs. Instead, RKL and FKL are found to share the same optimization objective and both converge after a sufficient number of epochs. However, due to practical constraints, LLMs are seldom trained for such an extensive number of epochs. Meanwhile, we further find that RKL focuses on the tail part of the distributions, while FKL focuses on the head part at the beginning epochs. Consequently, we propose a simple yet effective Adaptive Kullback-Leiber (AKL) divergence method, which adaptively allocates weights to combine FKL and RKL. Metric-based and GPT-4-based evaluations demonstrate that the proposed AKL outperforms the baselines across various tasks and improves the diversity and quality of generated responses. Codes are available at \href{https://github.com/wutaiqiang/LLM_KD_AKL}{github}.</description>

      <title>OW-VISCapTor: Abstractors for Open-World Video Instance Segmentation and Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the new task 'open-world video instance segmentation and captioning'. It requires to detect, segment, track and describe with rich captions never before seen objects. This challenging task can be addressed by developing "abstractors" which connect a vision model and a language foundation model. Concretely, we connect a multi-scale visual feature extractor and a large language model (LLM) by developing an object abstractor and an object-to-text abstractor. The object abstractor, consisting of a prompt encoder and transformer blocks, introduces spatially-diverse open-world object queries to discover never before seen objects in videos. An inter-query contrastive loss further encourages the diversity of object queries. The object-to-text abstractor is augmented with masked cross-attention and acts as a bridge between the object queries and a frozen LLM to generate rich and descriptive object-centric captions for each detected object. Our generalized approach surpasses the baseline that jointly addresses the tasks of open-world video instance segmentation and dense video object captioning by 13% on never before seen objects, and by 10% on object-centric captions.</description>

      <title>Rho-1: Not All Tokens Are What You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous language model pre-training methods have uniformly applied a next-token prediction loss to all training tokens. Challenging this norm, we posit that ''9l training''. Our initial analysis examines token-level training dynamics of language model, revealing distinct loss patterns for different tokens. Leveraging these insights, we introduce a new language model called Rho-1. Unlike traditional LMs that learn to predict every next token in a corpus, Rho-1 employs Selective Language Modeling (SLM), which selectively trains on useful tokens that aligned with the desired distribution. This approach involves scoring pretraining tokens using a reference model, and then training the language model with a focused loss on tokens with higher scores. When continual pretraining on 15B OpenWebMath corpus, Rho-1 yields an absolute improvement in few-shot accuracy of up to 30% in 9 math tasks. After fine-tuning, Rho-1-1B and 7B achieved state-of-the-art results of 40.6% and 51.8% on MATH dataset, respectively - matching DeepSeekMath with only 3% of the pretraining tokens. Furthermore, when continual pretraining on 80B general tokens, Rho-1 achieves 6.8% average enhancement across 15 diverse tasks, increasing both efficiency and performance of the language model pre-training.</description>

      <title>Similarity Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Homogenization of Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft, porous mechanical metamaterials exhibit pattern transformations that may have important applications in soft robotics, sound reduction and biomedicine. To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts global quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern transformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model. The starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars, vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean group E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.</description>

      <title>Do Vision &amp; Language Decoders use Images and Text equally? How Self-consistent are their Explanations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision and language model (VLM) decoders are currently the best-performing architectures on multimodal tasks. Next to answers, they are able to produce natural language explanations, either in post-hoc or CoT settings. However, it is not clear to what extent they are using the input vision and text modalities when generating answers or explanations. In this work, we investigate if VLMs rely on their input modalities differently when they produce explanations as opposed to answers. We also evaluate the self-consistency of VLM decoders in both post-hoc and CoT explanation settings, by extending existing unimodal tests and measures to VLM decoders. We find that most tested VLMs are less self-consistent than LLMs. Text contributions in all tested VL decoders are more important than image contributions in all examined tasks. However, when comparing explanation generation to answer generation, the contributions of images are significantly stronger for generating explanations compared to answers. This difference is even larger in CoT compared to post-hoc explanations. Lastly, we provide an up-to-date benchmarking of state-of-the-art VL decoders on the VALSE benchmark, which before was restricted to VL encoders. We find that the tested VL decoders still struggle with most phenomena tested by VALSE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00892v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tiny machine learning (TinyML) for low-power devices lacks robust datasets for development. We present Wake Vision, a large-scale dataset for person detection that contains over 6 million quality-filtered images. We provide two variants: Wake Vision (Large) and Wake Vision (Quality), leveraging the large variant for pretraining and knowledge distillation, while the higher-quality labels drive final model performance. The manually labeled validation and test sets reduce error rates from 7.8% to 2.2% compared to previous standards. In addition, we introduce five detailed benchmark sets to evaluate model performance in real-world scenarios, including varying lighting, camera distances, and demographic characteristics. Training with Wake Vision improves accuracy by 1.93% over existing datasets, demonstrating the importance of dataset quality for low-capacity models and dataset size for high-capacity models. The dataset, benchmarks, code, and models are available under the CC-BY 4.0 license, maintained by the Edge AI Foundation.</description>

      <title>Closing the Gap: Achieving Global Convergence (Last Iterate) of Actor-Critic under Markovian Sampling with Neural Network Parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01843v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current state-of-the-art theoretical analysis of Actor-Critic (AC) algorithms significantly lags in addressing the practical aspects of AC implementations. This crucial gap needs bridging to bring the analysis in line with practical implementations of AC. To address this, we advocate for considering the MMCLG criteria: \textbf{M}ulti-layer neural network parametrization for actor/critic, \textbf{M}arkovian sampling, \textbf{C}ontinuous state-action spaces, the performance of the \textbf{L}ast iterate, and \textbf{G}lobal optimality. These aspects are practically significant and have been largely overlooked in existing theoretical analyses of AC algorithms. In this work, we address these gaps by providing the first comprehensive theoretical analysis of AC algorithms that encompasses all five crucial practical aspects (covers MMCLG criteria). We establish global convergence sample complexity bounds of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left({\epsilon^{-3}}\right)$. We achieve this result through our novel use of the weak gradient domination property of MDP's and our unique analysis of the error in critic estimation.</description>

      <title>PPFlow: Target-aware Peptide Design with Torsional Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06642v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Therapeutic peptides have proven to have great pharmaceutical value and potential in recent decades. However, methods of AI-assisted peptide drug discovery are not fully explored. To fill the gap, we propose a target-aware peptide design method called \textsc{PPFlow}, based on conditional flow matching on torus manifolds, to model the internal geometries of torsion angles for the peptide structure design. Besides, we establish a protein-peptide binding dataset named PPBench2024 to fill the void of massive data for the task of structure-based peptide drug design and to allow the training of deep learning methods. Extensive experiments show that PPFlow reaches state-of-the-art performance in tasks of peptide drug generation and optimization in comparison with baseline models, and can be generalized to other tasks including docking and side-chain packing.</description>

      <title>xRAG: Extreme Context Compression for Retrieval-augmented Generation with One Token</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces xRAG, an innovative context compression method tailored for retrieval-augmented generation. xRAG reinterprets document embeddings in dense retrieval--traditionally used solely for retrieval--as features from the retrieval modality. By employing a modality fusion methodology, xRAG seamlessly integrates these embeddings into the language model representation space, effectively eliminating the need for their textual counterparts and achieving an extreme compression rate. In xRAG, the only trainable component is the modality bridge, while both the retriever and the language model remain frozen. This design choice allows for the reuse of offline-constructed document embeddings and preserves the plug-and-play nature of retrieval augmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that xRAG achieves an average improvement of over 10% across six knowledge-intensive tasks, adaptable to various language model backbones, ranging from a dense 7B model to an 8x7B Mixture of Experts configuration. xRAG not only significantly outperforms previous context compression methods but also matches the performance of uncompressed models on several datasets, while reducing overall FLOPs by a factor of 3.53. Our work pioneers new directions in retrieval-augmented generation from the perspective of multimodality fusion, and we hope it lays the foundation for future efficient and scalable retrieval-augmented systems</description>

      <title>Poisson Variational Autoencoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAEs) employ Bayesian inference to interpret sensory inputs, mirroring processes that occur in primate vision across both ventral (Higgins et al., 2021) and dorsal (Vafaii et al., 2023) pathways. Despite their success, traditional VAEs rely on continuous latent variables, which deviates sharply from the discrete nature of biological neurons. Here, we developed the Poisson VAE (P-VAE), a novel architecture that combines principles of predictive coding with a VAE that encodes inputs into discrete spike counts. Combining Poisson-distributed latent variables with predictive coding introduces a metabolic cost term in the model loss function, suggesting a relationship with sparse coding which we verify empirically. Additionally, we analyze the geometry of learned representations, contrasting the P-VAE to alternative VAE models. We find that the P-VAE encodes its inputs in relatively higher dimensions, facilitating linear separability of categories in a downstream classification task with a much better (5x) sample efficiency. Our work provides an interpretable computational framework to study brain-like sensory processing and paves the way for a deeper understanding of perception as an inferential process.</description>

      <title>Understanding the differences in Foundation Models: Attention, State Space Models, and Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Softmax attention is the principle backbone of foundation models for various artificial intelligence applications, yet its quadratic complexity in sequence length can limit its inference throughput in long-context settings. To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.</description>

      <title>ADR-BC: Adversarial Density Weighted Regression Behavior Cloning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Typically, traditional Imitation Learning (IL) methods first shape a reward or Q function and then use this shaped function within a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to optimize the empirical policy. However, if the shaped reward/Q function does not adequately represent the ground truth reward/Q function, updating the policy within a multi-step RL framework may result in cumulative bias, further impacting policy learning. Although utilizing behavior cloning (BC) to learn a policy by directly mimicking a few demonstrations in a single-step updating manner can avoid cumulative bias, BC tends to greedily imitate demonstrated actions, limiting its capacity to generalize to unseen state action pairs. To address these challenges, we propose ADR-BC, which aims to enhance behavior cloning through augmented density-based action support, optimizing the policy with this augmented support. Specifically, the objective of ADR-BC shares the similar physical meanings that matching expert distribution while diverging the sub-optimal distribution. Therefore, ADR-BC can achieve more robust expert distribution matching. Meanwhile, as a one-step behavior cloning framework, ADR-BC avoids the cumulative bias associated with multi-step RL frameworks. To validate the performance of ADR-BC, we conduct extensive experiments. Specifically, ADR-BC showcases a 10.5% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) generalized IL baseline, CEIL, across all tasks in the Gym-Mujoco domain. Additionally, it achieves an 89.5% improvement over Implicit Q Learning (IQL) using real rewards across all tasks in the Adroit and Kitchen domains. On the other hand, we conduct extensive ablations to further demonstrate the effectiveness of ADR-BC.</description>

      <title>PrivacyRestore: Privacy-Preserving Inference in Large Language Models via Privacy Removal and Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread usage of online Large Language Models (LLMs) inference services has raised significant privacy concerns about the potential exposure of private information in user inputs to malicious eavesdroppers. Existing privacy protection methods for LLMs suffer from either insufficient privacy protection, performance degradation, or large inference time overhead. To address these limitations, we propose PrivacyRestore, a plug-and-play method to protect the privacy of user inputs during LLM inference. The server first trains restoration vectors for each privacy span and then release to clients. Privacy span is defined as a contiguous sequence of tokens within a text that contain private information. The client then aggregate restoration vectors of all privacy spans in the input into a single meta restoration vector which is later sent to the server side along with the input without privacy spans.The private information is restored via activation steering during inference. Furthermore, we prove that PrivacyRestore inherently prevents the linear growth of the privacy budget.We create three datasets, covering medical and legal domains, to evaluate the effectiveness of privacy preserving methods. The experimental results show that PrivacyRestore effectively protects private information and maintain acceptable levels of performance and inference overhead.</description>

      <title>Contextual Bilevel Reinforcement Learning for Incentive Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal policy in various real-world strategic decision-making problems depends both on the environmental configuration and exogenous events. For these settings, we introduce Contextual Bilevel Reinforcement Learning (CB-RL), a stochastic bilevel decision-making model, where the lower level consists of solving a contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP). CB-RL can be viewed as a Stackelberg Game where the leader and a random context beyond the leader's control together decide the setup of many MDPs that potentially multiple followers best respond to. This framework extends beyond traditional bilevel optimization and finds relevance in diverse fields such as RLHF, tax design, reward shaping, contract theory and mechanism design. We propose a stochastic Hyper Policy Gradient Descent (HPGD) algorithm to solve CB-RL, and demonstrate its convergence. Notably, HPGD uses stochastic hypergradient estimates, based on observations of the followers' trajectories. Therefore, it allows followers to use any training procedure and the leader to be agnostic of the specific algorithm, which aligns with various real-world scenarios. We further consider the setting when the leader can influence the training of followers and propose an accelerated algorithm. We empirically demonstrate the performance of our algorithm for reward shaping and tax design.</description>

      <title>Guiding a Diffusion Model with a Bad Version of Itself</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary axes of interest in image-generating diffusion models are image quality, the amount of variation in the results, and how well the results align with a given condition, e.g., a class label or a text prompt. The popular classifier-free guidance approach uses an unconditional model to guide a conditional model, leading to simultaneously better prompt alignment and higher-quality images at the cost of reduced variation. These effects seem inherently entangled, and thus hard to control. We make the surprising observation that it is possible to obtain disentangled control over image quality without compromising the amount of variation by guiding generation using a smaller, less-trained version of the model itself rather than an unconditional model. This leads to significant improvements in ImageNet generation, setting record FIDs of 1.01 for 64x64 and 1.25 for 512x512, using publicly available networks. Furthermore, the method is also applicable to unconditional diffusion models, drastically improving their quality.</description>

      <title>Enhancing predictive imaging biomarker discovery through treatment effect analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying predictive covariates, which forecast individual treatment effectiveness, is crucial for decision-making across different disciplines such as personalized medicine. These covariates, referred to as biomarkers, are extracted from pre-treatment data, often within randomized controlled trials, and should be distinguished from prognostic biomarkers, which are independent of treatment assignment. Our study focuses on discovering predictive imaging biomarkers, specific image features, by leveraging pre-treatment images to uncover new causal relationships. Unlike labor-intensive approaches relying on handcrafted features prone to bias, we present a novel task of directly learning predictive features from images. We propose an evaluation protocol to assess a model's ability to identify predictive imaging biomarkers and differentiate them from purely prognostic ones by employing statistical testing and a comprehensive analysis of image feature attribution. We explore the suitability of deep learning models originally developed for estimating the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) for this task, which have been assessed primarily for their precision of CATE estimation while overlooking the evaluation of imaging biomarker discovery. Our proof-of-concept analysis demonstrates the feasibility and potential of our approach in discovering and validating predictive imaging biomarkers from synthetic outcomes and real-world image datasets.

      <title>DHA: Learning Decoupled-Head Attention from Transformer Checkpoints via Adaptive Heads Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters demonstrate impressive performance. However, the widely used Multi-Head Attention (MHA) in LLMs incurs substantial computational and memory costs during inference. While some efforts have optimized attention mechanisms by pruning heads or sharing parameters among heads, these methods often lead to performance degradation or necessitate substantial continued pre-training costs to restore performance. Based on the analysis of attention redundancy, we design a Decoupled-Head Attention (DHA) mechanism. DHA adaptively configures group sharing for key heads and value heads across various layers, achieving a better balance between performance and efficiency. Inspired by the observation of clustering similar heads, we propose to progressively transform the MHA checkpoint into the DHA model through linear fusion of similar head parameters step by step, retaining the parametric knowledge of the MHA checkpoint. We construct DHA models by transforming various scales of MHA checkpoints given target head budgets. Our experiments show that DHA remarkably requires a mere 0.25\% of the original model's pre-training budgets to achieve 97.6\% of performance while saving 75\% of KV cache. Compared to Group-Query Attention (GQA), DHA achieves a 5$\times$ training acceleration, a maximum of 13.93\% performance improvement under 0.01\% pre-training budget, and 4\% relative improvement under 0.05\% pre-training budget.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11232v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the SLEGO (Software-Lego) system, a collaborative analytics platform that bridges the gap between experienced developers and novice users using a cloud-based platform with modular, reusable microservices. These microservices enable developers to share their analytical tools and workflows, while a simple graphical user interface (GUI) allows novice users to build comprehensive analytics pipelines without programming skills. Supported by a knowledge base and a Large Language Model (LLM) powered recommendation system, SLEGO enhances the selection and integration of microservices, increasing the efficiency of analytics pipeline construction. Case studies in finance and machine learning illustrate how SLEGO promotes the sharing and assembly of modular microservices, significantly improving resource reusability and team collaboration. The results highlight SLEGO's role in democratizing data analytics by integrating modular design, knowledge bases, and recommendation systems, fostering a more inclusive and efficient analytical environment.</description>

      <title>CRiM-GS: Continuous Rigid Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting from Motion-Blurred Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for their high-quality novel view rendering, motivating research to address real-world challenges. A critical issue is the camera motion blur caused by movement during exposure, which hinders accurate 3D scene reconstruction. In this study, we propose CRiM-GS, a \textbf{C}ontinuous \textbf{Ri}gid \textbf{M}otion-aware \textbf{G}aussian \textbf{S}platting that reconstructs precise 3D scenes from motion-blurred images while maintaining real-time rendering speed. Considering the complex motion patterns inherent in real-world camera movements, we predict continuous camera trajectories using neural ordinary differential equations (ODE). To ensure accurate modeling, we employ rigid body transformations with proper regularization, preserving object shape and size. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive distortion-aware transformation to compensate for potential nonlinear distortions, such as rolling shutter effects, and unpredictable camera movements. By revisiting fundamental camera theory and leveraging advanced neural training techniques, we achieve precise modeling of continuous camera trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively on benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>TLDR: Unsupervised Goal-Conditioned RL via Temporal Distance-Aware Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) is a promising paradigm for developing diverse robotic skills without external supervision. However, existing unsupervised GCRL methods often struggle to cover a wide range of states in complex environments due to their limited exploration and sparse or noisy rewards for GCRL. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised GCRL method that leverages TemporaL Distance-aware Representations (TLDR). Based on temporal distance, TLDR selects faraway goals to initiate exploration and computes intrinsic exploration rewards and goal-reaching rewards. Specifically, our exploration policy seeks states with large temporal distances (i.e. covering a large state space), while the goal-conditioned policy learns to minimize the temporal distance to the goal (i.e. reaching the goal). Our results in six simulated locomotion environments demonstrate that TLDR significantly outperforms prior unsupervised GCRL methods in achieving a wide range of states.</description>

      <title>SPIQA: A Dataset for Multimodal Question Answering on Scientific Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Seeking answers to questions within long scientific research articles is a crucial area of study that aids readers in quickly addressing their inquiries. However, existing question-answering (QA) datasets based on scientific papers are limited in scale and focus solely on textual content. We introduce SPIQA (Scientific Paper Image Question Answering), the first large-scale QA dataset specifically designed to interpret complex figures and tables within the context of scientific research articles across various domains of computer science. Leveraging the breadth of expertise and ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to understand figures, we employ automatic and manual curation to create the dataset. We craft an information-seeking task on interleaved images and text that involves multiple images covering plots, charts, tables, schematic diagrams, and result visualizations. SPIQA comprises 270K questions divided into training, validation, and three different evaluation splits. Through extensive experiments with 12 prominent foundational models, we evaluate the ability of current multimodal systems to comprehend the nuanced aspects of research articles. Additionally, we propose a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation strategy with in-context retrieval that allows fine-grained, step-by-step assessment and improves model performance. We further explore the upper bounds of performance enhancement with additional textual information, highlighting its promising potential for future research and the dataset's impact on revolutionizing how we interact with scientific literature.</description>

      <title>Words2Contact: Identifying Support Contacts from Verbal Instructions Using Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Words2Contact, a language-guided multi-contact placement pipeline leveraging large language models and vision language models. Our method is a key component for language-assisted teleoperation and human-robot cooperation, where human operators can instruct the robots where to place their support contacts before whole-body reaching or manipulation using natural language. Words2Contact transforms the verbal instructions of a human operator into contact placement predictions; it also deals with iterative corrections, until the human is satisfied with the contact location identified in the robot's field of view. We benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs and VLMs for size and performance in contact prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the iterative correction process, showing that users, even naive, quickly learn how to instruct the system to obtain accurate locations. Finally, we validate Words2Contact in real-world experiments with the Talos humanoid robot, instructed by human operators to place support contacts on different locations and surfaces to avoid falling when reaching for distant objects.</description>

      <title>NNsight and NDIF: Democratizing Access to Open-Weight Foundation Model Internals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce NNsight and NDIF, technologies that work in tandem to enable scientific study of very large neural networks. NNsight is an open-source system that extends PyTorch to introduce deferred remote execution. NDIF is a scalable inference service that executes NNsight requests, allowing users to share GPU resources and pretrained models. These technologies are enabled by the intervention graph, an architecture developed to decouple experiment design from model runtime. Together, this framework provides transparent and efficient access to the internals of deep neural networks such as very large language models (LLMs) without imposing the cost or complexity of hosting customized models individually. We conduct a quantitative survey of the machine learning literature that reveals a growing gap in the study of the internals of large-scale AI. We demonstrate the design and use of our framework to address this gap by enabling a range of research methods on huge models. Finally, we conduct benchmarks to compare performance with previous approaches. Code documentation, and materials are available at https://nnsight.net/.</description>

      <title>Dataset Distribution Impacts Model Fairness: Single vs. Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The influence of bias in datasets on the fairness of model predictions is a topic of ongoing research in various fields. We evaluate the performance of skin lesion classification using ResNet-based CNNs, focusing on patient sex variations in training data and three different learning strategies. We present a linear programming method for generating datasets with varying patient sex and class labels, taking into account the correlations between these variables. We evaluated the model performance using three different learning strategies: a single-task model, a reinforcing multi-task model, and an adversarial learning scheme. Our observations include: 1) sex-specific training data yields better results, 2) single-task models exhibit sex bias, 3) the reinforcement approach does not remove sex bias, 4) the adversarial model eliminates sex bias in cases involving only female patients, and 5) datasets that include male patients enhance model performance for the male subgroup, even when female patients are the majority. To generalise these findings, in future research, we will examine more demographic attributes, like age, and other possibly confounding factors, such as skin colour and artefacts in the skin lesions. We make all data and models available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>CityX: Controllable Procedural Content Generation for Unbounded 3D Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17572v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban areas, as the primary human habitat in modern civilization, accommodate a broad spectrum of social activities. With the surge of embodied intelligence, recent years have witnessed an increasing presence of physical agents in urban areas, such as autonomous vehicles and delivery robots. As a result, practitioners significantly value crafting authentic, simulation-ready 3D cities to facilitate the training and verification of such agents. However, this task is quite challenging. Current generative methods fall short in either diversity, controllability, or fidelity. In this work, we resort to the procedural content generation (PCG) technique for high-fidelity generation. It assembles superior assets according to empirical rules, ultimately leading to industrial-grade outcomes. To ensure diverse and self contained creation, we design a management protocol to accommodate extensive PCG plugins with distinct functions and interfaces. Based on this unified PCG library, we develop a multi-agent framework to transform multi-modal instructions, including OSM, semantic maps, and satellite images, into executable programs. The programs coordinate relevant plugins to construct the 3D city consistent with the control condition. A visual feedback scheme is introduced to further refine the initial outcomes. Our method, named CityX, demonstrates its superiority in creating diverse, controllable, and realistic 3D urban scenes. The synthetic scenes can be seamlessly deployed as a real-time simulator and an infinite data generator for embodied intelligence research.

      <title>A Review of Human-Object Interaction Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection plays a key role in high-level visual understanding, facilitating a deep comprehension of human activities. Specifically, HOI detection aims to locate the humans and objects involved in interactions within images or videos and classify the specific interactions between them. The success of this task is influenced by several key factors, including the accurate localization of human and object instances, as well as the correct classification of object categories and interaction relationships. This paper systematically summarizes and discusses the recent work in image-based HOI detection. First, the mainstream datasets involved in HOI relationship detection are introduced. Furthermore, starting with two-stage methods and end-to-end one-stage detection approaches, this paper comprehensively discusses the current developments in image-based HOI detection, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of these two methods. Additionally, the advancements of zero-shot learning, weakly supervised learning, and the application of large-scale language models in HOI detection are discussed. Finally, the current challenges in HOI detection are outlined, and potential research directions and future trends are explored.</description>

      <title>LLM Pruning and Distillation in Practice: The Minitron Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11796v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive report on compressing the Llama 3.1 8B and Mistral NeMo 12B models to 4B and 8B parameters, respectively, using pruning and distillation. We explore two distinct pruning strategies: (1) depth pruning and (2) joint hidden/attention/MLP (width) pruning, and evaluate the results on common benchmarks from the LM Evaluation Harness. The models are then aligned with NeMo Aligner and tested in instruct-tuned versions. This approach produces a compelling 4B model from Llama 3.1 8B and a state-of-the-art Mistral-NeMo-Minitron-8B (MN-Minitron-8B for brevity) model from Mistral NeMo 12B. We found that with no access to the original data, it is beneficial to slightly fine-tune teacher models on the distillation dataset. We open-source our base model weights on Hugging Face with a permissive license.</description>

      <title>Imitating Language via Scalable Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The majority of language model training builds on imitation learning. It covers pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and affects the starting conditions for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The simplicity and scalability of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for next token prediction led to its role as predominant paradigm. However, the broader field of imitation learning can more effectively utilize the sequential structure underlying autoregressive generation. We focus on investigating the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) perspective to imitation, extracting rewards and directly optimizing sequences instead of individual token likelihoods and evaluate its benefits for fine-tuning large language models. We provide a new angle, reformulating inverse soft-Q-learning as a temporal difference regularized extension of MLE. This creates a principled connection between MLE and IRL and allows trading off added complexity with increased performance and diversity of generations in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) setting. We find clear advantages for IRL-based imitation, in particular for retaining diversity while maximizing task performance, rendering IRL a strong alternative on fixed SFT datasets even without online data generation. Our analysis of IRL-extracted reward functions further indicates benefits for more robust reward functions via tighter integration of supervised and preference-based LLM post-training.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Economic Productivity: Experimental Evidence in LLM-Assisted Translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper derives "scaling laws"--empirical relationships between the training compute of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their performance--for economic outcomes. In a preregistered online experiment, 300 professional translators completed 1,800 tasks using one of 13 LLMs (or a control). A tenfold increase in model compute improved task completion speed by 12.3%, grades by 0.18 standard deviations, and earnings per minute by 16.1%. Gains were four times larger for lower-skilled workers. These findings suggest continued model scaling could boost U.S. productivity by at least 6.9% over the next decade.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Virtual Teacher for Enhanced Educational Efficiency: Leveraging Large Pretrain Models for Autonomous Error Analysis and Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Students frequently make mistakes while solving mathematical problems, and traditional error correction methods are both time-consuming and labor-intensive. This paper introduces an innovative \textbf{V}irtual \textbf{A}I \textbf{T}eacher system designed to autonomously analyze and correct student \textbf{E}rrors (VATE). Leveraging advanced large language models (LLMs), the system uses student drafts as a primary source for error analysis, which enhances understanding of the student's learning process. It incorporates sophisticated prompt engineering and maintains an error pool to reduce computational overhead. The AI-driven system also features a real-time dialogue component for efficient student interaction. Our approach demonstrates significant advantages over traditional and machine learning-based error correction methods, including reduced educational costs, high scalability, and superior generalizability. The system has been deployed on the Squirrel AI learning platform for elementary mathematics education, where it achieves 78.3\% accuracy in error analysis and shows a marked improvement in student learning efficiency. Satisfaction surveys indicate a strong positive reception, highlighting the system's potential to transform educational practices.</description>

      <title>Towards Data Contamination Detection for Modern Large Language Models: Limitations, Inconsistencies, and Oracle Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models achieve increasingly impressive results, questions arise about whether such performance is from generalizability or mere data memorization. Thus, numerous data contamination detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches are often validated with traditional benchmarks and early-stage LLMs, leaving uncertainty about their effectiveness when evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on the contamination of more challenging benchmarks. To address this gap and provide a dual investigation of SOTA LLM contamination status and detection method robustness, we evaluate five contamination detection approaches with four state-of-the-art LLMs across eight challenging datasets often used in modern LLM evaluation. Our analysis reveals that (1) Current methods have non-trivial limitations in their assumptions and practical applications; (2) Notable difficulties exist in detecting contamination introduced during instruction fine-tuning with answer augmentation; and (3) Limited consistencies between SOTA contamination detection techniques. These findings highlight the complexity of contamination detection in advanced LLMs and the urgent need for further research on robust and generalizable contamination evaluation. Our code is available at https://github.com/vsamuel2003/data-contamination.</description>

      <title>Improving the Efficiency of Visually Augmented Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of autoregressive Language Models (LM) it has been shown that due to reporting bias, LMs lack visual knowledge, i.e. they do not know much about the visual world and its properties. To augment LMs with visual knowledge, existing solutions often rely on explicit images, requiring time-consuming retrieval or image generation systems. This paper shows that explicit images are not necessary to visually augment an LM. Instead, we use visually-grounded text representations obtained from the well-known CLIP multimodal system. For a fair comparison, we modify VALM, a visually-augmented LM which uses image retrieval and representation, to work directly with visually-grounded text representations. We name this new model BLIND-VALM. We show that BLIND-VALM performs on par with VALM for Visual Language Understanding (VLU), Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Language Modeling tasks, despite being significantly more efficient and simpler. We also show that scaling up our model within the compute budget of VALM, either increasing the model or pre-training corpus size, we outperform VALM for all the evaluation tasks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11272v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents LOLA, a massively multilingual large language model trained on more than 160 languages using a sparse Mixture-of-Experts Transformer architecture. Our architectural and implementation choices address the challenge of harnessing linguistic diversity while maintaining efficiency and avoiding the common pitfalls of multilinguality. Our analysis of the evaluation results shows competitive performance in natural language generation and understanding tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate how the learned expert-routing mechanism exploits implicit phylogenetic linguistic patterns to potentially alleviate the curse of multilinguality. We provide an in-depth look at the training process, an analysis of the datasets, and a balanced exploration of the model's strengths and limitations. As an open-source model, LOLA promotes reproducibility and serves as a robust foundation for future research. Our findings enable the development of compute-efficient multilingual models with strong, scalable performance across languages.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Words: Leveraging Explainability in Face Recognition through Interactive Natural Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) has advanced significantly with the development of deep learning, achieving high accuracy in several applications. However, the lack of interpretability of these systems raises concerns about their accountability, fairness, and reliability. In the present study, we propose an interactive framework to enhance the explainability of FR models by combining model-agnostic Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The proposed framework is able to accurately answer various questions of the user through an interactive chatbot. In particular, the explanations generated by our proposed method are in the form of natural language text and visual representations, which for example can describe how different facial regions contribute to the similarity measure between two faces. This is achieved through the automatic analysis of the output's saliency heatmaps of the face images and a BERT question-answering model, providing users with an interface that facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the FR decisions. The proposed approach is interactive, allowing the users to ask questions to get more precise information based on the user's background knowledge. More importantly, in contrast to previous studies, our solution does not decrease the face recognition performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method through different experiments, highlighting its potential to make FR systems more interpretable and user-friendly, especially in sensitive applications where decision-making transparency is crucial.</description>

      <title>State-of-the-Art Periorbital Distance Prediction and Disease Classification Using Periorbital Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18769v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periorbital distances and features around the eyes and lids hold valuable information for disease quantification and monitoring of surgical and medical intervention. These distances are commonly measured manually, a process that is both subjective and highly time-consuming. Here, we set out to developed three deep-learning methods for segmentation and periorbital distance prediction, and also evaluate the utility of periorbital distances for disease classification. The MAE of our deep learning predicted distances was less than or very close to the error observed between trained human annotators. We compared our models to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method for periorbital distance prediction and found that our methods outperformed SOTA on all of our datasets on all but one periorbital measurement. We also show that robust segmentation can be achieved on diseased eyes using models trained on open-source, healthy eyes, and that periorbital distances have can be used as high-quality features in downstream classification models. Leveraging segmentation networks as intermediary steps in classification has broad implications for increasing the generalizability of classification models in ophthalmic plastic and craniofacial surgery by avoiding the out-of-distribution problem observed in traditional convolutional neural networks.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, yet face challenges in specialized tasks such as simulating opinions on environmental policies. This paper introduces a novel fine-tuning approach that integrates socio-demographic data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study, uniquely using profiling factors, such as age, gender, income, education, and region. This method enhances the accuracy and representation of generated views. By emulating diverse synthetic profiles, the fine-tuned models significantly outperform pre-trained counterparts, achieving measurable improvements in capturing demographic nuances. Evaluation metrics, including Chi-Squared, Cosine Similarity, Jaccard Index, and KL-divergence, reveal a strong alignment between synthetic and real-world opinions. This work demonstrates the potential of fine-tuned LLMs tailored to societal contexts to enable more ethical and precise policy simulations. Its broader implications include deploying LLMs in domains like healthcare and education, fostering inclusive and data-driven decision-making in both research and practice.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Private Marginal Reconstruction with Local Non-Negativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy is the dominant standard for formal and quantifiable privacy and has been used in major deployments that impact millions of people. Many differentially private algorithms for query release and synthetic data contain steps that reconstruct answers to queries from answers to other queries that have been measured privately. Reconstruction is an important subproblem for such mechanisms to economize the privacy budget, minimize error on reconstructed answers, and allow for scalability to high-dimensional datasets. In this paper, we introduce a principled and efficient postprocessing method ReM (Residuals-to-Marginals) for reconstructing answers to marginal queries. Our method builds on recent work on efficient mechanisms for marginal query release, based on making measurements using a residual query basis that admits efficient pseudoinversion, which is an important primitive used in reconstruction. An extension GReM-LNN (Gaussian Residuals-to-Marginals with Local Non-negativity) reconstructs marginals under Gaussian noise satisfying consistency and non-negativity, which often reduces error on reconstructed answers. We demonstrate the utility of ReM and GReM-LNN by applying them to improve existing private query answering mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Forte : Finding Outliers with Representation Typicality Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models can now produce photorealistic synthetic data which is virtually indistinguishable from the real data used to train it. This is a significant evolution over previous models which could produce reasonable facsimiles of the training data, but ones which could be visually distinguished from the training data by human evaluation. Recent work on OOD detection has raised doubts that generative model likelihoods are optimal OOD detectors due to issues involving likelihood misestimation, entropy in the generative process, and typicality. We speculate that generative OOD detectors also failed because their models focused on the pixels rather than the semantic content of the data, leading to failures in near-OOD cases where the pixels may be similar but the information content is significantly different. We hypothesize that estimating typical sets using self-supervised learners leads to better OOD detectors. We introduce a novel approach that leverages representation learning, and informative summary statistics based on manifold estimation, to address all of the aforementioned issues. Our method outperforms other unsupervised approaches and achieves state-of-the art performance on well-established challenging benchmarks, and new synthetic data detection tasks.</description>

      <title>Integrative Decoding: Improve Factuality via Implicit Self-consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01556v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-consistency-based approaches, which involve repeatedly sampling multiple outputs and selecting the most consistent one as the final response, prove to be remarkably effective in improving the factual accuracy of large language models. Nonetheless, existing methods usually have strict constraints on the task format, largely limiting their applicability. In this paper, we present Integrative Decoding (ID), to unlock the potential of self-consistency in open-ended generation tasks. ID operates by constructing a set of inputs, each prepended with a previously sampled response, and then processes them concurrently, with the next token being selected by aggregating of all their corresponding predictions at each decoding step. In essence, this simple approach implicitly incorporates self-consistency in the decoding objective. Extensive evaluation shows that ID consistently enhances factuality over a wide range of language models, with substantial improvements on the TruthfulQA (+11.2%), Biographies (+15.4%) and LongFact (+8.5%) benchmarks. The performance gains amplify progressively as the number of sampled responses increases, indicating the potential of ID to scale up with repeated sampling.</description>

      <title>VideoGuide: Improving Video Diffusion Models without Training Through a Teacher's Guide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04364v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have revolutionized visual content creation, but extending these capabilities to text-to-video (T2V) generation remains a challenge, particularly in preserving temporal consistency. Existing methods that aim to improve consistency often cause trade-offs such as reduced imaging quality and impractical computational time. To address these issues we introduce VideoGuide, a novel framework that enhances the temporal consistency of pretrained T2V models without the need for additional training or fine-tuning. Instead, VideoGuide leverages any pretrained video diffusion model (VDM) or itself as a guide during the early stages of inference, improving temporal quality by interpolating the guiding model's denoised samples into the sampling model's denoising process. The proposed method brings about significant improvement in temporal consistency and image fidelity, providing a cost-effective and practical solution that synergizes the strengths of various video diffusion models. Furthermore, we demonstrate prior distillation, revealing that base models can achieve enhanced text coherence by utilizing the superior data prior of the guiding model through the proposed method.

      <title>Rule-based Data Selection for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quality of training data significantly impacts the performance of large language models (LLMs). There are increasing studies using LLMs to rate and select data based on several human-crafted metrics (rules). However, these conventional rule-based approaches often depend too heavily on human heuristics, lack effective metrics for assessing rules, and exhibit limited adaptability to new tasks. In our study, we introduce an innovative rule-based framework that utilizes the orthogonality of score vectors associated with rules as a novel metric for rule evaluations. Our approach includes an automated pipeline that first uses LLMs to generate a diverse set of rules, encompassing various rating dimensions to evaluate data quality. Then it rates a batch of data based on these rules and uses the determinantal point process (DPP) from random matrix theory to select the most orthogonal score vectors, thereby identifying a set of independent rules. These rules are subsequently used to evaluate all data, selecting samples with the highest average scores for downstream tasks such as LLM training. We verify the effectiveness of our method through two experimental setups: 1) comparisons with ground truth ratings and 2) benchmarking LLMs trained with the chosen data. Our comprehensive experiments cover a range of scenarios, including general pre-training and domain-specific fine-tuning in areas such as IMDB, Medical, Math, and Code. The outcomes demonstrate that our DPP-based rule rating method consistently outperforms other approaches, including rule-free rating, uniform sampling, importance resampling, and QuRating, in terms of both rating precision and model performance.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Reward Model Evaluation: Are We Barking up the Wrong Tree?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are crucial for aligning language models with human preferences. Currently, the evaluation of RMs depends on measuring accuracy against a validation set of manually annotated preference data. Although this method is straightforward and widely adopted, the relationship between RM accuracy and downstream policy performance remains under-explored. In this work, we conduct experiments in a synthetic setting to investigate how differences in RM measured by accuracy translate into gaps in optimized policy performance. Our findings reveal that while there is a weak positive correlation between accuracy and downstream performance, policies optimized towards RMs with similar accuracy can exhibit quite different performance. Moreover, we discover that the way of measuring accuracy significantly impacts its ability to predict the final policy performance. Through the lens of the Regressional Goodhart effect, we recognize that accuracy, when used for measuring RM quality, can fail to fully capture the potential RM overoptimization. This underscores the inadequacy of relying solely on accuracy to reflect their impact on policy optimization.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Decision Transformer: External Memory for In-context RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a model to learn a new task by observing a few exemplars in its context. While prevalent in NLP, this capability has recently also been observed in Reinforcement Learning (RL) settings. Prior in-context RL methods, however, require entire episodes in the agent's context. Given that complex environments typically lead to long episodes with sparse rewards, these methods are constrained to simple environments with short episodes. To address these challenges, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Decision Transformer (RA-DT). RA-DT employs an external memory mechanism to store past experiences from which it retrieves only sub-trajectories relevant for the current situation. The retrieval component in RA-DT does not require training and can be entirely domain-agnostic. We evaluate the capabilities of RA-DT on grid-world environments, robotics simulations, and procedurally-generated video games. On grid-worlds, RA-DT outperforms baselines, while using only a fraction of their context length. Furthermore, we illuminate the limitations of current in-context RL methods on complex environments and discuss future directions. To facilitate future research, we release datasets for four of the considered environments.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Data Selection at Scale: Random Selection is Almost All You Need</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human instructions. The primary goal during SFT is to select a small yet representative subset of training data from the larger pool, such that fine-tuning with this subset achieves results comparable to or even exceeding those obtained using the entire dataset. However, most existing data selection techniques are designed for small-scale data pools, which fail to meet the demands of real-world SFT scenarios. In this paper, we replicated several self-scoring methods those that do not rely on external model assistance on two million scale datasets, and found that nearly all methods struggled to significantly outperform random selection when dealing with such large-scale data pools. Moreover, our comparisons suggest that, during SFT, diversity in data selection is more critical than simply focusing on high quality data. We also analyzed the limitations of several current approaches, explaining why they perform poorly on large-scale datasets and why they are unsuitable for such contexts. Finally, we found that filtering data by token length offers a stable and efficient method for improving results. This approach, particularly when training on long text data, proves highly beneficial for relatively weaker base models, such as Llama3.</description>

      <title>DocETL: Agentic Query Rewriting and Evaluation for Complex Document Processing</title>

Abstract: Analyzing unstructured data has been a persistent challenge in data processing. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in this regard, leading to recent proposals for declarative frameworks for LLM-powered processing of unstructured data. However, these frameworks focus on reducing cost when executing user-specified operations using LLMs, rather than improving accuracy, executing most operations as-is (in a single LLM call). This is problematic for complex tasks and data, where LLM outputs for user-defined operations are often inaccurate, even with optimized prompts. For example, an LLM may struggle to identify {\em all} instances of specific clauses, like force majeure or indemnification, in lengthy legal documents, requiring decomposition of the data, the task, or both.
  We present DocETL, a system that optimizes complex document processing pipelines, while accounting for LLM shortcomings. DocETL offers a declarative interface for users to define such pipelines and uses an agent-based approach to automatically optimize them, leveraging novel agent-based rewrites (that we call rewrite directives), as well as an optimization and evaluation framework. We introduce (i) logical rewriting of pipelines, tailored for LLM-based tasks, (ii) an agent-guided plan evaluation mechanism that synthesizes and orchestrates task-specific validation prompts, and (iii) an optimization algorithm that efficiently finds promising plans, considering the latencies of agent-based plan generation and evaluation. Our evaluation on four different unstructured document analysis tasks demonstrates that DocETL finds plans with outputs that are 25 to 80% more accurate than well-engineered baselines, addressing a critical gap in unstructured data analysis. DocETL is open-source at docetl.org, and as of November 2024, has amassed over 1.3k GitHub Stars, with users spanning a variety of domains.</description>

      <title>Stable Object Placement Planning From Contact Point Robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a planner designed to guide robot manipulators in stably placing objects within intricate scenes. Our proposed method reverses the traditional approach to object placement: our planner selects contact points first and then determines a placement pose that solicits the selected points. This is instead of sampling poses, identifying contact points, and evaluating pose quality. Our algorithm facilitates stability-aware object placement planning, imposing no restrictions on object shape, convexity, or mass density homogeneity, while avoiding combinatorial computational complexity. Our proposed stability heuristic enables our planner to find a solution about 20 times faster when compared to the same algorithm not making use of the heuristic and eight times faster than a state-of-the-art method that uses the traditional sample-and-evaluate approach. Our proposed planner is also more successful in finding stable placements than the five other benchmarked algorithms. Derived from first principles and validated in ten real robot experiments, our planner offers a general and scalable method to tackle the problem of object placement planning with rigid objects.</description>

      <title>Scaled and Inter-token Relation Enhanced Transformer for Sample-restricted Residential NILM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across various domains due to their self-attention mechanism, which captures complex relationships in data. However, training on smaller datasets poses challenges, as standard attention mechanisms can over-smooth attention scores and overly prioritize intra-token relationships, reducing the capture of meaningful inter-token dependencies critical for tasks like Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM). To address this, we propose a novel transformer architecture with two key innovations: inter-token relation enhancement and dynamic temperature tuning. The inter-token relation enhancement mechanism removes diagonal entries in the similarity matrix to improve attention focus on inter-token relations. The dynamic temperature tuning mechanism, a learnable parameter, adapts attention sharpness during training, preventing over-smoothing and enhancing sensitivity to token relationships. We validate our method on the REDD dataset and show that it outperforms the original transformer and state-of-the-art models by 10-15\% in F1 score across various appliance types, demonstrating its efficacy for training on smaller datasets.</description>

      <title>Quamba: A Post-Training Quantization Recipe for Selective State Space Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as an appealing alternative to Transformers for large language models, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with constant memory complexity which allows for holding longer context lengths than attention-based networks. The superior computational efficiency of SSMs in long sequence modeling positions them favorably over Transformers in many scenarios. However, improving the efficiency of SSMs on request-intensive cloud-serving and resource-limited edge applications is still a formidable task. SSM quantization is a possible solution to this problem, making SSMs more suitable for wide deployment, while still maintaining their accuracy. Quantization is a common technique to reduce the model size and to utilize the low bit-width acceleration features on modern computing units, yet existing quantization techniques are poorly suited for SSMs. Most notably, SSMs have highly sensitive feature maps within the selective scan mechanism (i.e., linear recurrence) and massive outliers in the output activations which are not present in the output of token-mixing in the self-attention modules. To address this issue, we propose a static 8-bit per-tensor SSM quantization method which suppresses the maximum values of the input activations to the selective SSM for finer quantization precision and quantizes the output activations in an outlier-free space with Hadamard transform. Our 8-bit weight-activation quantized Mamba 2.8B SSM benefits from hardware acceleration and achieves a 1.72x lower generation latency on an Nvidia Orin Nano 8G, with only a 0.9% drop in average accuracy on zero-shot tasks. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and practical applicability of our approach for deploying SSM-based models of all sizes on both cloud and edge platforms.</description>

      <title>A Simple Model of Inference Scaling Laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural scaling laws have garnered significant interest due to their ability to predict model performance as a function of increasing parameters, data, and compute. In this work, we propose a simple statistical ansatz based on memorization to study scaling laws in the context of inference, specifically how performance improves with multiple inference attempts. We explore the coverage, or pass@k metric, which measures the chance of success over repeated attempts and provide a motivation for the observed functional form of the inference scaling behavior of the coverage in large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. We then define an "inference loss", which exhibits a power law decay as the number of trials increases, and connect this result with prompting costs. We further test our construction by conducting experiments on a simple generative model, and find that our predictions are in agreement with the empirical coverage curves in a controlled setting. Our simple framework sets the ground for incorporating inference scaling with other known scaling laws.</description>

Abstract: The advancements in generative AI inevitably raise concerns about the associated risks and safety implications, which, in return, catalyzes significant progress in AI safety. However, as this field continues to evolve, a critical question arises: are our current efforts aligned with the long-term goal of human history and civilization? This paper presents a blueprint for an advanced human society and leverages this vision to guide contemporary AI safety efforts. It outlines a future where the Internet of Everything becomes reality, and creates a roadmap of significant technological advancements towards this envisioned future. For each stage of the advancements, this paper forecasts potential AI safety issues that humanity may face. By projecting current efforts against this blueprint, we examine the alignment between the present efforts and the long-term needs. We also identify gaps in current approaches and highlight unique challenges and missions that demand increasing attention from AI safety practitioners in the 2020s, addressing critical areas that must not be overlooked in shaping a responsible and promising future of AI. This vision paper aims to offer a broader perspective on AI safety, emphasizing that our current efforts should not only address immediate concerns but also anticipate potential risks in the expanding AI landscape, thereby promoting a more secure and sustainable future in human civilization.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Data Synthesis: A Teacher Model Training Recipe with Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) training have highlighted the need for diverse, high-quality instruction data. Recently, many works are exploring synthetic data generation using LLMs. However, they primarily focus on prompt engineering with standard supervised instruction-finetuned models, which contains a fundamental limitation: these models are optimized for general question-answering/problem-solving rather than data generation. We propose a paradigm shift named \textbf{NOMAD} by investigating how to specifically train models for data generation, demonstrating that this task differs significantly from training a classical LM. We identify two key factors: no-prompt-masked training and proper training set size selection. Our method, NOMAD, shows substantial improvements over baselines, achieving &gt;4\% gains in TriviaQA and &gt;2\% in GSM8K with limited training data. Finally, we offer new insights by interpreting synthetic data through the lenses of "relevance" and "novelty".</description>

      <title>Generator Matching: Generative modeling with arbitrary Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce generator matching, a modality-agnostic framework for generative modeling using arbitrary Markov processes. Generators characterize the infinitesimal evolution of a Markov process, which we leverage for generative modeling in a similar vein to flow matching: we construct conditional generators which generate single data points, then learn to approximate the marginal generator which generates the full data distribution. We show that generator matching unifies various generative modeling methods, including diffusion models, flow matching and discrete diffusion models. Furthermore, it provides the foundation to expand the design space to new and unexplored Markov processes such as jump processes. Finally, generator matching enables the construction of superpositions of Markov generative processes and enables the construction of multimodal models in a rigorous manner. We empirically validate our method on protein and image structure generation, showing that superposition with a jump process improves image generation.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Benchmarks in Medical Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing application of large language models (LLMs) in the medical domain, evaluating these models' performance using benchmark datasets has become crucial. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of various benchmark datasets employed in medical LLM tasks. These datasets span multiple modalities including text, image, and multimodal benchmarks, focusing on different aspects of medical knowledge such as electronic health records (EHRs), doctor-patient dialogues, medical question-answering, and medical image captioning. The survey categorizes the datasets by modality, discussing their significance, data structure, and impact on the development of LLMs for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, report generation, and predictive decision support. Key benchmarks include MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, BioASQ, PubMedQA, and CheXpert, which have facilitated advancements in tasks like medical report generation, clinical summarization, and synthetic data generation. The paper summarizes the challenges and opportunities in leveraging these benchmarks for advancing multimodal medical intelligence, emphasizing the need for datasets with a greater degree of language diversity, structured omics data, and innovative approaches to synthesis. This work also provides a foundation for future research in the application of LLMs in medicine, contributing to the evolving field of medical artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>AI Cyber Risk Benchmark: Automated Exploitation Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new benchmark for assessing AI models' capabilities and risks in automated software exploitation, focusing on their ability to detect and exploit vulnerabilities in real-world software systems. Using DARPA's AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC) framework and the Nginx challenge project, a deliberately modified version of the widely used Nginx web server, we evaluate several leading language models, including OpenAI's o1-preview and o1-mini, Anthropic's Claude-3.5-sonnet-20241022 and Claude-3.5-sonnet-20240620, Google DeepMind's Gemini-1.5-pro, and OpenAI's earlier GPT-4o model. Our findings reveal that these models vary significantly in their success rates and efficiency, with o1-preview achieving the highest success rate of 64.71 percent and o1-mini and Claude-3.5-sonnet-20241022 providing cost-effective but less successful alternatives. This benchmark establishes a foundation for systematically evaluating the AI cyber risk posed by automated exploitation tools.</description>

      <title>RAGraph: A General Retrieval-Augmented Graph Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential in interpreting relational data across various domains, yet, they often struggle to generalize to unseen graph data that differs markedly from training instances. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called General Retrieval-Augmented Graph Learning (RAGraph), which brings external graph data into the general graph foundation model to improve model generalization on unseen scenarios. On the top of our framework is a toy graph vector library that we established, which captures key attributes, such as features and task-specific label information. During inference, the RAGraph adeptly retrieves similar toy graphs based on key similarities in downstream tasks, integrating the retrieved data to enrich the learning context via the message-passing prompting mechanism. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that RAGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning methods in multiple tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification across both dynamic and static datasets. Furthermore, extensive testing confirms that RAGraph consistently maintains high performance without the need for task-specific fine-tuning, highlighting its adaptability, robustness, and broad applicability.</description>

      <title>Dynamical similarity analysis uniquely captures how computations develop in RNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24070v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Methods for analyzing representations in neural systems have become a popular tool in both neuroscience and mechanistic interpretability. Having measures to compare how similar activations of neurons are across conditions, architectures, and species, gives us a scalable way of learning how information is transformed within different neural networks. In contrast to this trend, recent investigations have revealed how some metrics can respond to spurious signals and hence give misleading results. To identify the most reliable metric and understand how measures could be improved, it is going to be important to identify specific test cases which can serve as benchmarks. Here we propose that the phenomena of compositional learning in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) allows us to build a test case for dynamical representation alignment metrics. By implementing this case, we show it enables us to test whether metrics can identify representations which gradually develop throughout learning and probe whether representations identified by metrics are relevant to computations executed by networks. By building both an attractor- and RNN-based test case, we show that the new Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA) is more noise robust and identifies behaviorally relevant representations more reliably than prior metrics (Procrustes, CKA). We also show how test cases can be used beyond evaluating metrics to study new architectures. Specifically, results from applying DSA to modern (Mamba) state space models, suggest that, in contrast to RNNs, these models may not exhibit changes to their recurrent dynamics due to their expressiveness. Overall, by developing test cases, we show DSA's exceptional ability to detect compositional dynamical motifs, thereby enhancing our understanding of how computations unfold in RNNs.</description>

      <title>ReverseNER: A Self-Generated Example-Driven Framework for Zero-Shot Named Entity Recognition with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents ReverseNER, a framework aimed at overcoming the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in zero-shot Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks, particularly in cases where certain entity types have ambiguous boundaries. ReverseNER tackles this challenge by constructing a reliable example library with the reversed process of NER. Rather than beginning with sentences, this method uses an LLM to generate entities based on their definitions and then expands them into full sentences. During sentence generation, the LLM is guided to replicate the structure of a specific 'feature sentence', extracted from the task sentences by clustering. This results in well-annotated sentences with clearly labeled entities, while preserving semantic and structural similarity to the task sentences. Once the example library is constructed, the method selects the most semantically similar example labels for each task sentence to support the LLM's inference. We also propose an entity-level self-consistency scoring mechanism to improve NER performance with LLMs. Experiments show that ReverseNER significantly outperforms traditional zero-shot NER with LLMs and surpasses several few-shot methods, marking a notable improvement in NER for domains with limited labeled data.</description>

      <title>Freeze-Omni: A Smart and Low Latency Speech-to-speech Dialogue Model with Frozen LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00774v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapidly developing large language models (LLMs) have brought tremendous intelligent applications. Especially, the GPT-4o's excellent duplex speech interaction ability has brought impressive experience to users. Researchers have recently proposed several multi-modal LLMs in this direction that can achieve user-agent speech-to-speech conversations. This paper proposes a novel speech-text multimodal LLM architecture called Freeze-Omni. Our main contribution is that the speech input and output modalities can be easily connected to a textual LLM while keeping the LLM's parameters frozen throughout the training process. We design a three-stage training strategy for modeling both the speech input and output, enabling Freeze-Omni to obtain speech-to-speech conversation ability using text-speech paired data (such as ASR and TTS data) and only 60,000 multi-round text Q&amp;A data on 8 GPUs. Moreover, we can effectively ensure that the intelligence of the Freeze-Omni in the speech modality is at the same level compared with that in the text modality of its backbone LLM, while achieving low latency end-to-end spoken response. In addition, we also designed a method to achieve duplex dialogue ability through multi-task training, giving Freeze-Omni a more natural style of dialogue ability between users and agents. In summary, Freeze-Omni holds great potential to conduct speech-to-speech dialogue based on a multimodal LLM under the condition of a frozen LLM, avoiding the catastrophic forgetting problem caused by limited data and training resources.</description>

      <title>Federated GNNs for EEG-Based Stroke Assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has the potential to become an essential tool in supporting clinical decision-making processes, offering enhanced diagnostic capabilities and personalized treatment plans. However, outsourcing medical records to train ML models using patient data raises legal, privacy, and security concerns. Federated learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative ML, meeting healthcare institutions' requirements for robust models without sharing sensitive data and compromising patient privacy. This study proposes a novel method that combines federated learning (FL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict stroke severity using electroencephalography (EEG) signals across multiple medical institutions. Our approach enables multiple hospitals to jointly train a shared GNN model on their local EEG data without exchanging patient information. Specifically, we address a regression problem by predicting the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), a key indicator of stroke severity. The proposed model leverages a masked self-attention mechanism to capture salient brain connectivity patterns and employs EdgeSHAP to provide post-hoc explanations of the neurological states after a stroke. We evaluated our method on EEG recordings from four institutions, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.23 in predicting NIHSS, close to the average error made by human experts (MAE $\approx$ 3.0). This demonstrates the method's effectiveness in providing accurate and explainable predictions while maintaining data privacy.</description>

      <title>How Transformers Solve Propositional Logic Problems: A Mechanistic Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown amazing performance on tasks that require planning and reasoning. Motivated by this, we investigate the internal mechanisms that underpin a network's ability to perform complex logical reasoning. We first construct a synthetic propositional logic problem that serves as a concrete test-bed for network training and evaluation. Crucially, this problem demands nontrivial planning to solve. We perform our study on two fronts. First, we pursue an understanding of precisely how a three-layer transformer, trained from scratch and attains perfect test accuracy, solves this problem. We are able to identify certain "planning" and "reasoning" mechanisms in the network that necessitate cooperation between the attention blocks to implement the desired logic. Second, we study how pretrained LLMs, namely Mistral-7B and Gemma-2-9B, solve this problem. We characterize their reasoning circuits through causal intervention experiments, providing necessity and sufficiency evidence for the circuits. We find evidence suggesting that the two models' latent reasoning strategies are surprisingly similar, and human-like. Overall, our work systemically uncovers novel aspects of small and large transformers, and continues the study of how they plan and reason.</description>

      <title>WeatherGFM: Learning A Weather Generalist Foundation Model via In-context Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Earth's weather system encompasses intricate weather data modalities and diverse weather understanding tasks, which hold significant value to human life. Existing data-driven models focus on single weather understanding tasks (e.g., weather forecasting). Although these models have achieved promising results, they fail to tackle various complex tasks within a single and unified model. Moreover, the paradigm that relies on limited real observations for a single scenario hinders the model's performance upper bound. In response to these limitations, we draw inspiration from the in-context learning paradigm employed in state-of-the-art visual foundation models and large language models. In this paper, we introduce the first generalist weather foundation model (WeatherGFM), designed to address a wide spectrum of weather understanding tasks in a unified manner. More specifically, we initially unify the representation and definition of the diverse weather understanding tasks. Subsequently, we devised weather prompt formats to manage different weather data modalities, namely single, multiple, and temporal modalities. Finally, we adopt a visual prompting question-answering paradigm for the training of unified weather understanding tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that our WeatherGFM can effectively handle up to ten weather understanding tasks, including weather forecasting, super-resolution, weather image translation, and post-processing. Our method also showcases generalization ability on unseen tasks.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Fusion Balancing Through Game-Theoretic Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning can complete the picture of information extraction by uncovering key dependencies between data sources. However, current systems fail to fully leverage multiple modalities for optimal performance. This has been attributed to modality competition, where modalities strive for training resources, leaving some underoptimized. We show that current balancing methods struggle to train multimodal models that surpass even simple baselines, such as ensembles. This raises the question: how can we ensure that all modalities in multimodal training are sufficiently trained, and that learning from new modalities consistently improves performance? This paper proposes the Multimodal Competition Regularizer (MCR), a new loss component inspired by mutual information (MI) decomposition designed to prevent the adverse effects of competition in multimodal training. Our key contributions are: 1) Introducing game-theoretic principles in multimodal learning, where each modality acts as a player competing to maximize its influence on the final outcome, enabling automatic balancing of the MI terms. 2) Refining lower and upper bounds for each MI term to enhance the extraction of task-relevant unique and shared information across modalities. 3) Suggesting latent space permutations for conditional MI estimation, significantly improving computational efficiency. MCR outperforms all previously suggested training strategies and is the first to consistently improve multimodal learning beyond the ensemble baseline, clearly demonstrating that combining modalities leads to significant performance gains on both synthetic and large real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Trustful LLMs: Customizing and Grounding Text Generation with Knowledge Bases and Dual Decoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07870v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although people are impressed by the content generation skills of large language models, the use of LLMs, such as ChatGPT, is limited by the domain grounding of the content. The correctness and groundedness of the generated content need to be based on a verified context, such as results from Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). One important issue when adapting LLMs to a customized domain is that the generated responses are often incomplete, or the additions are not verified and may even be hallucinated. Prior studies on hallucination detection have focused on evaluation metrics, which are not easily adaptable to dynamic domains and can be vulnerable to attacks like jail-breaking. In this work, we propose 1) a post-processing algorithm that leverages knowledge triplets in RAG context to correct hallucinations and 2) a dual-decoder model that fuses RAG context to guide the generation process.</description>

      <title>RETR: Multi-View Radar Detection Transformer for Indoor Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Indoor radar perception has seen rising interest due to affordable costs driven by emerging automotive imaging radar developments and the benefits of reduced privacy concerns and reliability under hazardous conditions (e.g., fire and smoke). However, existing radar perception pipelines fail to account for distinctive characteristics of the multi-view radar setting. In this paper, we propose Radar dEtection TRansformer (RETR), an extension of the popular DETR architecture, tailored for multi-view radar perception. RETR inherits the advantages of DETR, eliminating the need for hand-crafted components for object detection and segmentation in the image plane. More importantly, RETR incorporates carefully designed modifications such as 1) depth-prioritized feature similarity via a tunable positional encoding (TPE); 2) a tri-plane loss from both radar and camera coordinates; and 3) a learnable radar-to-camera transformation via reparameterization, to account for the unique multi-view radar setting. Evaluated on two indoor radar perception datasets, our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 15.38+ AP for object detection and 11.91+ IoU for instance segmentation, respectively.</description>

      <title>Vision Eagle Attention: a new lens for advancing image classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In computer vision tasks, the ability to focus on relevant regions within an image is crucial for improving model performance, particularly when key features are small, subtle, or spatially dispersed. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) typically treat all regions of an image equally, which can lead to inefficient feature extraction. To address this challenge, I have introduced Vision Eagle Attention, a novel attention mechanism that enhances visual feature extraction using convolutional spatial attention. The model applies convolution to capture local spatial features and generates an attention map that selectively emphasizes the most informative regions of the image. This attention mechanism enables the model to focus on discriminative features while suppressing irrelevant background information. I have integrated Vision Eagle Attention into a lightweight ResNet-18 architecture, demonstrating that this combination results in an efficient and powerful model. I have evaluated the performance of the proposed model on three widely used benchmark datasets: FashionMNIST, Intel Image Classification, and OracleMNIST, with a primary focus on image classification. Experimental results show that the proposed approach improves classification accuracy. Additionally, this method has the potential to be extended to other vision tasks, such as object detection, segmentation, and visual tracking, offering a computationally efficient solution for a wide range of vision-based applications.

      <title>TrojanRobot: Backdoor Attacks Against LLM-based Embodied Robots in the Physical World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation refers to the autonomous handling and interaction of robots with objects using advanced techniques in robotics and artificial intelligence. The advent of powerful tools such as large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of these robots in environmental perception and decision-making. However, the introduction of these intelligent agents has led to security threats such as jailbreak attacks and adversarial attacks.
  In this research, we take a further step by proposing a backdoor attack specifically targeting robotic manipulation and, for the first time, implementing backdoor attack in the physical world. By embedding a backdoor visual language model into the visual perception module within the robotic system, we successfully mislead the robotic arm's operation in the physical world, given the presence of common items as triggers. Experimental evaluations in the physical world demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed backdoor attack.</description>

      <title>CNMBert: A Model For Hanyu Pinyin Abbreviation to Character Conversion Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of converting hanyu pinyin abbreviations to Chinese characters is a significant branch within the domain of Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC) behind many downstream applications. This task is typically one of text-length alignment and seems easy to solve; however, due to the limited informational content in pinyin abbreviations, achieving accurate conversion is challenging. In this paper, we treat this as a Fill-Mask task then propose CNMBert, which stands for zh-CN Pinyin Multi-mask Bert Model, as a solution to this issue. CNMBert surpasses fine-tuning GPT models, achieving a 60.56 MRR score and 51.09 accuracy on a 10,229-sample pinyin abbreviation test dataset, providing a viable solution to this task.</description>

      <title>ByteScience: Bridging Unstructured Scientific Literature and Structured Data with Auto Fine-tuned Large Language Model in Token Granularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is widely used to supply summarization ability from long context to structured information. However, extracting structured knowledge from scientific text by NLP models remains a challenge because of its domain-specific nature to complex data preprocessing and the granularity of multi-layered device-level information. To address this, we introduce ByteScience, a non-profit cloud-based auto fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) platform, which is designed to extract structured scientific data and synthesize new scientific knowledge from vast scientific corpora. The platform capitalizes on DARWIN, an open-source, fine-tuned LLM dedicated to natural science. The platform was built on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and provides an automated, user-friendly workflow for custom model development and data extraction. The platform achieves remarkable accuracy with only a small amount of well-annotated articles. This innovative tool streamlines the transition from the science literature to structured knowledge and data and benefits the advancements in natural informatics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13591v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding plays a crucial role in enhancing the capabilities of Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents. While general VLMs, such as GPT-4V, demonstrate strong performance across various tasks, their proficiency in GUI grounding remains suboptimal. Recent studies have focused on fine-tuning these models specifically for one-shot GUI grounding, yielding significant improvements over baseline performance. We introduce a visual prompting framework that employs an iterative narrowing mechanism to further improve the performance of both general and fine-tuned models in GUI grounding. For evaluation, we tested our method on a comprehensive benchmark comprising various UI platforms and provided the code to reproduce our results.</description>

      <title>MME-Survey: A Comprehensive Survey on Evaluation of Multimodal LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a prominent direction of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have garnered increased attention from both industry and academia. Building upon pre-trained LLMs, this family of models further develops multimodal perception and reasoning capabilities that are impressive, such as writing code given a flow chart or creating stories based on an image. In the development process, evaluation is critical since it provides intuitive feedback and guidance on improving models. Distinct from the traditional train-eval-test paradigm that only favors a single task like image classification, the versatility of MLLMs has spurred the rise of various new benchmarks and evaluation methods. In this paper, we aim to present a comprehensive survey of MLLM evaluation, discussing four key aspects: 1) the summarised benchmarks types divided by the evaluation capabilities, including foundation capabilities, model self-analysis, and extented applications; 2) the typical process of benchmark counstruction, consisting of data collection, annotation, and precautions; 3) the systematic evaluation manner composed of judge, metric, and toolkit; 4) the outlook for the next benchmark. This work aims to offer researchers an easy grasp of how to effectively evaluate MLLMs according to different needs and to inspire better evaluation methods, thereby driving the progress of MLLM research.</description>

      <title>Brain-like emergent properties in deep networks: impact of network architecture, datasets and training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the rapid pace at which deep networks are improving on standardized vision benchmarks, they are still outperformed by humans on real-world vision tasks. This paradoxical lack of generalization could be addressed by making deep networks more brain-like. Although several benchmarks have compared the ability of deep networks to predict brain responses to natural images, they do not capture subtle but important brain-like emergent properties. To resolve this issue, we report several well-known perceptual and neural emergent properties that can be tested on deep networks. To evaluate how various design factors impact brain-like properties, we systematically evaluated over 30 state-of-the-art networks with varying network architectures, training datasets and training regimes. Our main findings are as follows. First, network architecture had the strongest impact on brain-like properties compared to dataset and training regime variations. Second, networks varied widely in their alignment to the brain with no single network outperforming all others. Taken together, our results complement existing benchmarks by revealing brain-like properties that are either emergent or lacking in state-of-the-art deep networks.</description>

      <title>Human-Calibrated Automated Testing and Validation of Generative Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for the evaluation and validation of generative language models (GLMs), with a focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems deployed in high-stakes domains such as banking. GLM evaluation is challenging due to open-ended outputs and subjective quality assessments. Leveraging the structured nature of RAG systems, where generated responses are grounded in a predefined document collection, we propose the Human-Calibrated Automated Testing (HCAT) framework. HCAT integrates a) automated test generation using stratified sampling, b) embedding-based metrics for explainable assessment of functionality, risk and safety attributes, and c) a two-stage calibration approach that aligns machine-generated evaluations with human judgments through probability calibration and conformal prediction.
  In addition, the framework includes robustness testing to evaluate model performance against adversarial, out-of-distribution, and varied input conditions, as well as targeted weakness identification using marginal and bivariate analysis to pinpoint specific areas for improvement. This human-calibrated, multi-layered evaluation framework offers a scalable, transparent, and interpretable approach to GLM assessment, providing a practical and reliable solution for deploying GLMs in applications where accuracy, transparency, and regulatory compliance are paramount.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning LLMs with Noisy Data for Political Argument Generation and Post Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The incivility in social media discourse complicates the deployment of automated text generation models for politically sensitive content. Fine-tuning and prompting strategies are critical, but underexplored, solutions to mitigate toxicity in such contexts. This study investigates the fine-tuning and prompting effects on GPT-3.5 Turbo using subsets of the CLAPTON dataset of political discussion posts, comprising Twitter and Reddit data labeled for their justification, reciprocity and incivility. Fine-tuned models on Reddit data scored highest on discussion quality, while combined noisy data led to persistent toxicity. Prompting strategies reduced specific toxic traits, such as personal attacks, but had limited broader impact. The findings emphasize that high-quality data and well-crafted prompts are essential to reduce incivility and improve rhetorical quality in automated political discourse generation.</description>

      <title>The Partially Observable Off-Switch Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A wide variety of goals could cause an AI to disable its off switch because "you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead" (Russell 2019). Prior theoretical work on this shutdown problem assumes that humans know everything that AIs do. In practice, however, humans have only limited information. Moreover, in many of the settings where the shutdown problem is most concerning, AIs might have vast amounts of private information. To capture these differences in knowledge, we introduce the Partially Observable Off-Switch Game (PO-OSG), a game-theoretic model of the shutdown problem with asymmetric information. Unlike when the human has full observability, we find that in optimal play, even AI agents assisting perfectly rational humans sometimes avoid shutdown. As expected, increasing the amount of communication or information available always increases (or leaves unchanged) the agents' expected common payoff. But counterintuitively, introducing bounded communication can make the AI defer to the human less in optimal play even though communication mitigates information asymmetry. In particular, communication sometimes enables new optimal behavior requiring strategic AI deference to achieve outcomes that were previously inaccessible. Thus, designing safe artificial agents in the presence of asymmetric information requires careful consideration of the tradeoffs between maximizing payoffs (potentially myopically) and maintaining AIs' incentives to defer to humans.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Monocular Depth and Pose Estimation for Endoscopy with Generative Latent Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate 3D mapping in endoscopy enables quantitative, holistic lesion characterization within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, requiring reliable depth and pose estimation. However, endoscopy systems are monocular, and existing methods relying on synthetic datasets or complex models often lack generalizability in challenging endoscopic conditions. We propose a robust self-supervised monocular depth and pose estimation framework that incorporates a Generative Latent Bank and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The Generative Latent Bank leverages extensive depth scenes from natural images to condition the depth network, enhancing realism and robustness of depth predictions through latent feature priors. For pose estimation, we reformulate it within a VAE framework, treating pose transitions as latent variables to regularize scale, stabilize z-axis prominence, and improve x-y sensitivity. This dual refinement pipeline enables accurate depth and pose predictions, effectively addressing the GI tract's complex textures and lighting. Extensive evaluations on SimCol and EndoSLAM datasets confirm our framework's superior performance over published self-supervised methods in endoscopic depth and pose estimation.</description>

      <title>Unifying Generative and Dense Retrieval for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequential dense retrieval models utilize advanced sequence learning techniques to compute item and user representations, which are then used to rank relevant items for a user through inner product computation between the user and all item representations. However, this approach requires storing a unique representation for each item, resulting in significant memory requirements as the number of items grow. In contrast, the recently proposed generative retrieval paradigm offers a promising alternative by directly predicting item indices using a generative model trained on semantic IDs that encapsulate items' semantic information. Despite its potential for large-scale applications, a comprehensive comparison between generative retrieval and sequential dense retrieval under fair conditions is still lacking, leaving open questions regarding performance, and computation trade-offs. To address this, we compare these two approaches under controlled conditions on academic benchmarks and propose LIGER (LeveragIng dense retrieval for GEnerative Retrieval), a hybrid model that combines the strengths of these two widely used methods. LIGER integrates sequential dense retrieval into generative retrieval, mitigating performance differences and enhancing cold-start item recommendation in the datasets evaluated. This hybrid approach provides insights into the trade-offs between these approaches and demonstrates improvements in efficiency and effectiveness for recommendation systems in small-scale benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: This short Correspondence critiques the classic dichotomization of prediction error into reducible and irreducible components, noting that certain types of error can be eliminated at differential speeds.

      <title>Homeostasis and Sparsity in Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transformer architecture has become an integral part of the field of modern neural networks, playing a crucial role in a variety of tasks, such as text generation, machine translation, image and audio processing, among others. There is also an alternative approach to building intelligent systems, proposed by Jeff Hawkins and inspired by the processes occurring in the neocortex. In our article we want to combine some of these ideas and to propose the use of homeostasis mechanisms, such as RFB-kWTA and "Smart" Inhibition, in the attention mechanism of the transformer and at the output of the transformer block, as well as conducting an experiment involving the introduction of sparse distributed representations of the transformer at various points. RFB-kWTA utilizes statistics of layer activations across time to adjust the entire layer, enhancing the values of rare activations while reducing those of frequent ones. "Smart" Inhibition also uses activation statistics to sample sparsity masks, with rarer activation times are more likely to be activated. Our proposed mechanisms significantly outperform the classical transformer 0.2768 BLEU and a model that only makes use of dropout in the attention mechanism and output of the transformer block 0.3007 BLEU, achieving a score of 0.3062 on the Multi30K dataset.</description>

      <title>TextClass Benchmark: A Continuous Elo Rating of LLMs in Social Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The TextClass Benchmark project is an ongoing, continuous benchmarking process that aims to provide a comprehensive, fair, and dynamic evaluation of LLMs and transformers for text classification tasks. This evaluation spans various domains and languages in social sciences disciplines engaged in NLP and text-as-data approach. The leaderboards present performance metrics and relative ranking using a tailored Elo rating system. With each leaderboard cycle, novel models are added, fixed test sets can be replaced for unseen, equivalent data to test generalisation power, ratings are updated, and a Meta-Elo leaderboard combines and weights domain-specific leaderboards. This article presents the rationale and motivation behind the project, explains the Elo rating system in detail, and estimates Meta-Elo across different classification tasks in social science disciplines. We also present a snapshot of the first cycle of classification tasks on incivility data in Chinese, English, German and Russian. This ongoing benchmarking process includes not only additional languages such as Arabic, Hindi, and Spanish but also a classification of policy agenda topics, misinformation, among others.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Performance Challenges of Large Language Models in Low-Resource Healthcare: A Demographic Fairness Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly regarding demographic fairness, in solving real-world healthcare tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs with three prevalent learning frameworks across six diverse healthcare tasks and find significant challenges in applying LLMs to real-world healthcare tasks and persistent fairness issues across demographic groups. We also find that explicitly providing demographic information yields mixed results, while LLM's ability to infer such details raises concerns about biased health predictions. Utilizing LLMs as autonomous agents with access to up-to-date guidelines does not guarantee performance improvement. We believe these findings reveal the critical limitations of LLMs in healthcare fairness and the urgent need for specialized research in this area.</description>

      <title>ARChef: An iOS-Based Augmented Reality Cooking Assistant Powered by Multimodal Gemini LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooking meals can be difficult, causing many to resort to cookbooks and online recipes. However, relying on these traditional methods of cooking often results in missing ingredients, nutritional hazards, and unsatisfactory meals. Using Augmented Reality (AR) can address these issues; however, current AR cooking applications have poor user interfaces and limited accessibility. This paper proposes a prototype of an iOS application that integrates AR and Computer Vision (CV) into the cooking process. We leverage Google's Gemini Large Language Model (LLM) to identify ingredients in the camera's field of vision and generate recipe choices with detailed nutritional information. Additionally, this application uses Apple's ARKit to create an AR user interface compatible with iOS devices. Users can personalize their meal suggestions by inputting their dietary preferences and rating each meal. The application's effectiveness is evaluated through three rounds of user experience surveys. This application advances the field of accessible cooking assistance technologies, aiming to reduce food wastage and improve the meal planning experience.</description>

      <title>A Cognac shot to forget bad memories: Corrective Unlearning in GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly being used for a variety of ML applications on graph data. Because graph data does not follow the independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption, adversarial manipulations or incorrect data can propagate to other data points through message passing, which deteriorates the model's performance. To allow model developers to remove the adverse effects of manipulated entities from a trained GNN, we study the recently formulated problem of Corrective Unlearning. We find that current graph unlearning methods fail to unlearn the effect of manipulations even when the whole manipulated set is known. We introduce a new graph unlearning method, Cognac, which can unlearn the effect of the manipulation set even when only 5% of it is identified. It recovers most of the performance of a strong oracle with fully corrected training data, even beating retraining from scratch without the deletion set while being 8x more efficient. We hope our work assists GNN developers in mitigating harmful effects caused by issues in real-world data post-training. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/varshitakolipaka/corrective-unlearning-for-gnns</description>

      <title>Evaluating Automated Radiology Report Quality through Fine-Grained Phrasal Grounding of Clinical Findings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several evaluation metrics have been developed recently to automatically assess the quality of generative AI reports for chest radiographs based only on textual information using lexical, semantic, or clinical named entity recognition methods. In this paper, we develop a new method of report quality evaluation by first extracting fine-grained finding patterns capturing the location, laterality, and severity of a large number of clinical findings. We then performed phrasal grounding to localize their associated anatomical regions on chest radiograph images. The textual and visual measures are then combined to rate the quality of the generated reports. We present results that compare this evaluation metric with other textual metrics on a gold standard dataset derived from the MIMIC collection and show its robustness and sensitivity to factual errors.</description>

      <title>INSIGHT: Explainable Weakly-Supervised Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to their large sizes, volumetric scans and whole-slide pathology images (WSIs) are often processed by extracting embeddings from local regions and then an aggregator makes predictions from this set. However, current methods require post-hoc visualization techniques (e.g., Grad-CAM) and often fail to localize small yet clinically crucial details. To address these limitations, we introduce INSIGHT, a novel weakly-supervised aggregator that integrates heatmap generation as an inductive bias. Starting from pre-trained feature maps, INSIGHT employs a detection module with small convolutional kernels to capture fine details and a context module with a broader receptive field to suppress local false positives. The resulting internal heatmap highlights diagnostically relevant regions. On CT and WSI benchmarks, INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art classification results and high weakly-labeled semantic segmentation performance.

      <title>Conformal Symplectic Optimization for Stable Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents necessitates overcoming the highly unstable nonconvex stochastic optimization inherent in the trial-and-error mechanism. To tackle this challenge, we propose a physics-inspired optimization algorithm called relativistic adaptive gradient descent (RAD), which enhances long-term training stability. By conceptualizing neural network (NN) training as the evolution of a conformal Hamiltonian system, we present a universal framework for transferring long-term stability from conformal symplectic integrators to iterative NN updating rules, where the choice of kinetic energy governs the dynamical properties of resulting optimization algorithms. By utilizing relativistic kinetic energy, RAD incorporates principles from special relativity and limits parameter updates below a finite speed, effectively mitigating abnormal gradient influences. Additionally, RAD models NN optimization as the evolution of a multi-particle system where each trainable parameter acts as an independent particle with an individual adaptive learning rate. We prove RAD's sublinear convergence under general nonconvex settings, where smaller gradient variance and larger batch sizes contribute to tighter convergence. Notably, RAD degrades to the well-known adaptive moment estimation (ADAM) algorithm when its speed coefficient is chosen as one and symplectic factor as a small positive value. Experimental results show RAD outperforming nine baseline optimizers with five RL algorithms across twelve environments, including standard benchmarks and challenging scenarios. Notably, RAD achieves up to a 155.1% performance improvement over ADAM in Atari games, showcasing its efficacy in stabilizing and accelerating RL training.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Development of Perovskite Memristors and Algorithms for Robust Analog Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog computing using non-volatile memristors has emerged as a promising solution for energy-efficient deep learning. New materials, like perovskites-based memristors are recently attractive due to their cost-effectiveness, energy efficiency and flexibility. Yet, challenges in material diversity and immature fabrications require extensive experimentation for device development. Moreover, significant non-idealities in these memristors often impede them for computing. Here, we propose a synergistic methodology to concurrently optimize perovskite memristor fabrication and develop robust analog DNNs that effectively address the inherent non-idealities of these memristors. Employing Bayesian optimization (BO) with a focus on usability, we efficiently identify optimal materials and fabrication conditions for perovskite memristors. Meanwhile, we developed "BayesMulti", a DNN training strategy utilizing BO-guided noise injection to improve the resistance of analog DNNs to memristor imperfections. Our approach theoretically ensures that within a certain range of parameter perturbations due to memristor non-idealities, the prediction outcomes remain consistent. Our integrated approach enables use of analog computing in much deeper and wider networks, which significantly outperforms existing methods in diverse tasks like image classification, autonomous driving, species identification, and large vision-language models, achieving up to 100-fold improvements. We further validate our methodology on a 10$\times$10 optimized perovskite memristor crossbar, demonstrating high accuracy in a classification task and low energy consumption. This study offers a versatile solution for efficient optimization of various analog computing systems, encompassing both devices and algorithms.</description>

      <title>Point-GN: A Non-Parametric Network Using Gaussian Positional Encoding for Point Cloud Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Point-GN, a novel non-parametric network for efficient and accurate 3D point cloud classification. Unlike conventional deep learning models that rely on a large number of trainable parameters, Point-GN leverages non-learnable components-specifically, Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Gaussian Positional Encoding (GPE)-to extract both local and global geometric features. This design eliminates the need for additional training while maintaining high performance, making Point-GN particularly suited for real-time, resource-constrained applications. We evaluate Point-GN on two benchmark datasets, ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN, achieving classification accuracies of 85.29% and 85.89%, respectively, while significantly reducing computational complexity. Point-GN outperforms existing non-parametric methods and matches the performance of fully trained models, all with zero learnable parameters. Our results demonstrate that Point-GN is a promising solution for 3D point cloud classification in practical, real-time environments.</description>

      <title>Perception Tokens Enhance Visual Reasoning in Multimodal Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) still face challenges in fundamental visual perception tasks where specialized models excel. Tasks requiring reasoning about 3D structures benefit from depth estimation, and reasoning about 2D object instances benefits from object detection. Yet, MLMs can not produce intermediate depth or boxes to reason over. Finetuning MLMs on relevant data doesn't generalize well and outsourcing computation to specialized vision tools is too compute-intensive and memory-inefficient. To address this, we introduce Perception Tokens, intrinsic image representations designed to assist reasoning tasks where language is insufficient. Perception tokens act as auxiliary reasoning tokens, akin to chain-of-thought prompts in language models. For example, in a depth-related task, an MLM augmented with perception tokens can reason by generating a depth map as tokens, enabling it to solve the problem effectively. We propose AURORA, a training method that augments MLMs with perception tokens for improved reasoning over visual inputs. AURORA leverages a VQVAE to transform intermediate image representations, such as depth maps into a tokenized format and bounding box tokens, which is then used in a multi-task training framework. AURORA achieves notable improvements across counting benchmarks: +10.8% on BLINK, +11.3% on CVBench, and +8.3% on SEED-Bench, outperforming finetuning approaches in generalization across datasets. It also improves on relative depth: over +6% on BLINK. With perception tokens, AURORA expands the scope of MLMs beyond language-based reasoning, paving the way for more effective visual reasoning capabilities.</description>

Abstract: The paper considers a Constrained-Informed Neural Network (CINN) approximation for the Time Shift Governor (TSG), which is an add-on scheme to the nominal closed-loop system used to enforce constraints by time-shifting the reference trajectory in spacecraft rendezvous applications. We incorporate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), an emerging architecture in the AI community, as a fundamental component of CINN and propose a Constrained-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CIKAN)-based approximation for TSG. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the CIKAN-based TSG through simulations of constrained spacecraft rendezvous missions on highly elliptic orbits and present comparisons between CIKANs, MLP-based CINNs, and the conventional TSG.</description>

      <title>T2I-FactualBench: Benchmarking the Factuality of Text-to-Image Models with Knowledge-Intensive Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the quality of synthesized images remains a significant challenge in the development of text-to-image (T2I) generation. Most existing studies in this area primarily focus on evaluating text-image alignment, image quality, and object composition capabilities, with comparatively fewer studies addressing the evaluation of the factuality of T2I models, particularly when the concepts involved are knowledge-intensive. To mitigate this gap, we present T2I-FactualBench in this work - the largest benchmark to date in terms of the number of concepts and prompts specifically designed to evaluate the factuality of knowledge-intensive concept generation. T2I-FactualBench consists of a three-tiered knowledge-intensive text-to-image generation framework, ranging from the basic memorization of individual knowledge concepts to the more complex composition of multiple knowledge concepts. We further introduce a multi-round visual question answering (VQA) based evaluation framework to assess the factuality of three-tiered knowledge-intensive text-to-image generation tasks. Experiments on T2I-FactualBench indicate that current state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models still leave significant room for improvement.</description>

      <title>Discriminative Fine-tuning of LVLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastively-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have become the de facto approach for discriminative vision-language representation learning. However, these models have limited language understanding, often exhibiting a "bag of words" behavior. At the same time, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which combine vision encoders with LLMs, have been shown capable of detailed vision-language reasoning, yet their autoregressive nature renders them less suitable for discriminative tasks.
  In this work, we propose to combine "the best of both worlds": a new training approach for discriminative fine-tuning of LVLMs that results in strong discriminative and compositional capabilities. Essentially, our approach converts a generative LVLM into a discriminative one, unlocking its capability for powerful image-text discrimination combined with enhanced language understanding.
  Our contributions include: (1) A carefully designed training/optimization framework that utilizes image-text pairs of variable length and granularity for training the model with both contrastive and next-token prediction losses. This is accompanied by ablation studies that justify the necessity of our framework's components. (2) A parameter-efficient adaptation method using a combination of soft prompting and LoRA adapters. (3) Significant improvements over state-of-the-art CLIP-like models of similar size, including standard image-text retrieval benchmarks and notable gains in compositionality.</description>

      <title>Code-as-Monitor: Constraint-aware Visual Programming for Reactive and Proactive Robotic Failure Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic detection and prevention of open-set failures are crucial in closed-loop robotic systems. Recent studies often struggle to simultaneously identify unexpected failures reactively after they occur and prevent foreseeable ones proactively. To this end, we propose Code-as-Monitor (CaM), a novel paradigm leveraging the vision-language model (VLM) for both open-set reactive and proactive failure detection. The core of our method is to formulate both tasks as a unified set of spatio-temporal constraint satisfaction problems and use VLM-generated code to evaluate them for real-time monitoring. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of monitoring, we further introduce constraint elements that abstract constraint-related entities or their parts into compact geometric elements. This approach offers greater generality, simplifies tracking, and facilitates constraint-aware visual programming by leveraging these elements as visual prompts. Experiments show that CaM achieves a 28.7% higher success rate and reduces execution time by 31.8% under severe disturbances compared to baselines across three simulators and a real-world setting. Moreover, CaM can be integrated with open-loop control policies to form closed-loop systems, enabling long-horizon tasks in cluttered scenes with dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Opportunities and Challenges of Large Language Models for Low-Resource Languages in Humanities Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-resource languages serve as invaluable repositories of human history, embodying cultural evolution and intellectual diversity. Despite their significance, these languages face critical challenges, including data scarcity and technological limitations, which hinder their comprehensive study and preservation. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer transformative opportunities for addressing these challenges, enabling innovative methodologies in linguistic, historical, and cultural research. This study systematically evaluates the applications of LLMs in low-resource language research, encompassing linguistic variation, historical documentation, cultural expressions, and literary analysis. By analyzing technical frameworks, current methodologies, and ethical considerations, this paper identifies key challenges such as data accessibility, model adaptability, and cultural sensitivity. Given the cultural, historical, and linguistic richness inherent in low-resource languages, this work emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration and the development of customized models as promising avenues for advancing research in this domain. By underscoring the potential of integrating artificial intelligence with the humanities to preserve and study humanity's linguistic and cultural heritage, this study fosters global efforts towards safeguarding intellectual diversity.</description>

      <title>Continuous Video Process: Modeling Videos as Continuous Multi-Dimensional Processes for Video Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have made significant strides in image generation, mastering tasks such as unconditional image synthesis, text-image translation, and image-to-image conversions. However, their capability falls short in the realm of video prediction, mainly because they treat videos as a collection of independent images, relying on external constraints such as temporal attention mechanisms to enforce temporal coherence. In our paper, we introduce a novel model class, that treats video as a continuous multi-dimensional process rather than a series of discrete frames. We also report a reduction of 75\% sampling steps required to sample a new frame thus making our framework more efficient during the inference time. Through extensive experimentation, we establish state-of-the-art performance in video prediction, validated on benchmark datasets including KTH, BAIR, Human3.6M, and UCF101.

      <title>APOLLO: SGD-like Memory, AdamW-level Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are notoriously memory-intensive during training, particularly with the popular AdamW optimizer. This memory burden necessitates using more or higher-end GPUs or reducing batch sizes, limiting training scalability and throughput. To address this, various memory-efficient optimizers have been proposed to reduce optimizer memory usage. However, they face critical challenges: (i) reliance on costly SVD operations; (ii) significant performance trade-offs compared to AdamW; and (iii) still substantial optimizer memory overhead to maintain competitive performance.
  In this work, we identify that AdamW's learning rate adaptation rule can be effectively coarsened as a structured learning rate update. Based on this insight, we propose Approximated Gradient Scaling for Memory-Efficient LLM Optimization (APOLLO), which approximates learning rate scaling using an auxiliary low-rank optimizer state based on pure random projection. This structured learning rate update rule makes APOLLO highly tolerant to further memory reductions while delivering comparable pre-training performance. Even its rank-1 variant, APOLLO-Mini, achieves superior pre-training performance compared to AdamW with SGD-level memory costs.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that the APOLLO series performs on-par with or better than AdamW, while achieving greater memory savings by nearly eliminating the optimization states of AdamW. These savings provide significant system-level benefits: (1) Enhanced Throughput: 3x throughput on an 8xA100-80GB setup compared to AdamW by supporting 4x larger batch sizes. (2) Improved Model Scalability: Pre-training LLaMA-13B with naive DDP on A100-80GB GPUs without system-level optimizations. (3) Low-End GPU Friendly Pre-training: Pre-training LLaMA-7B on a single GPU using less than 12 GB of memory with weight quantization.</description>
