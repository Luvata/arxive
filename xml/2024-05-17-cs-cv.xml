      <title>Language-Guided Self-Supervised Video Summarization Using Text Semantic Matching Considering the Diversity of the Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current video summarization methods primarily depend on supervised computer vision techniques, which demands time-consuming manual annotations. Further, the annotations are always subjective which make this task more challenging. To address these issues, we analyzed the feasibility in transforming the video summarization into a text summary task and leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to boost video summarization. This paper proposes a novel self-supervised framework for video summarization guided by LLMs. Our method begins by generating captions for video frames, which are then synthesized into text summaries by LLMs. Subsequently, we measure semantic distance between the frame captions and the text summary. It's worth noting that we propose a novel loss function to optimize our model according to the diversity of the video. Finally, the summarized video can be generated by selecting the frames whose captions are similar with the text summary. Our model achieves competitive results against other state-of-the-art methods and paves a novel pathway in video summarization.</description>

      <title>ADA-Track: End-to-End Multi-Camera 3D Multi-Object Tracking with Alternating Detection and Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many query-based approaches for 3D Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) adopt the tracking-by-attention paradigm, utilizing track queries for identity-consistent detection and object queries for identity-agnostic track spawning. Tracking-by-attention, however, entangles detection and tracking queries in one embedding for both the detection and tracking task, which is sub-optimal. Other approaches resemble the tracking-by-detection paradigm, detecting objects using decoupled track and detection queries followed by a subsequent association. These methods, however, do not leverage synergies between the detection and association task. Combining the strengths of both paradigms, we introduce ADA-Track, a novel end-to-end framework for 3D MOT from multi-view cameras. We introduce a learnable data association module based on edge-augmented cross-attention, leveraging appearance and geometric features. Furthermore, we integrate this association module into the decoder layer of a DETR-based 3D detector, enabling simultaneous DETR-like query-to-image cross-attention for detection and query-to-query cross-attention for data association. By stacking these decoder layers, queries are refined for the detection and association task alternately, effectively harnessing the task dependencies. We evaluate our method on the nuScenes dataset and demonstrate the advantage of our approach compared to the two previous paradigms. Code is available at https://github.com/dsx0511/ADA-Track.</description>

      <title>CLIP with Quality Captions: A Strong Pretraining for Vision Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CLIP models perform remarkably well on zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks. But recent studies have shown that learnt representations in CLIP are not well suited for dense prediction tasks like object detection, semantic segmentation or depth estimation. More recently, multi-stage training methods for CLIP models was introduced to mitigate the weak performance of CLIP on downstream tasks. In this work, we find that simply improving the quality of captions in image-text datasets improves the quality of CLIP's visual representations, resulting in significant improvement on downstream dense prediction vision tasks. In fact, we find that CLIP pretraining with good quality captions can surpass recent supervised, self-supervised and weakly supervised pretraining methods. We show that when CLIP model with ViT-B/16 as image encoder is trained on well aligned image-text pairs it obtains 12.1% higher mIoU and 11.5% lower RMSE on semantic segmentation and depth estimation tasks over recent state-of-the-art Masked Image Modeling (MIM) pretraining methods like Masked Autoencoder (MAE). We find that mobile architectures also benefit significantly from CLIP pretraining. A recent mobile vision architecture, MCi2, with CLIP pretraining obtains similar performance as Swin-L, pretrained on ImageNet-22k for semantic segmentation task while being 6.1$\times$ smaller. Moreover, we show that improving caption quality results in $10\times$ data efficiency when finetuning for dense prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised vision-langage alignment of deep learning representations for bone X-rays analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes leveraging vision-language pretraining on bone X-rays paired with French reports to address downstream tasks of interest on bone radiography. A practical processing pipeline is introduced to anonymize and process French medical reports. Pretraining then consists in the self-supervised alignment of visual and textual embedding spaces derived from deep model encoders. The resulting image encoder is then used to handle various downstream tasks, including quantification of osteoarthritis, estimation of bone age on pediatric wrists, bone fracture and anomaly detection. Our approach demonstrates competitive performance on downstream tasks, compared to alternatives requiring a significantly larger amount of human expert annotations. Our work stands as the first study to integrate French reports to shape the embedding space devoted to bone X-Rays representations, capitalizing on the large quantity of paired images and reports data available in an hospital. By relying on generic vision-laguage deep models in a language-specific scenario, it contributes to the deployement of vision models for wider healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Bird's-Eye View to Street-View: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, street view imagery has grown to become one of the most important sources of geospatial data collection and urban analytics, which facilitates generating meaningful insights and assisting in decision-making. Synthesizing a street-view image from its corresponding satellite image is a challenging task due to the significant differences in appearance and viewpoint between the two domains. In this study, we screened 20 recent research papers to provide a thorough review of the state-of-the-art of how street-view images are synthesized from their corresponding satellite counterparts. The main findings are: (i) novel deep learning techniques are required for synthesizing more realistic and accurate street-view images; (ii) more datasets need to be collected for public usage; and (iii) more specific evaluation metrics need to be investigated for evaluating the generated images appropriately. We conclude that, due to applying outdated deep learning techniques, the recent literature failed to generate detailed and diverse street-view images.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis for Expectation-Maximization-Based Multi-Model 3D Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform detailed theoretical analysis of an expectation-maximization-based algorithm recently proposed in for solving a variation of the 3D registration problem, named multi-model 3D registration. Despite having shown superior empirical results, did not theoretically justify the conditions under which the EM approach converges to the ground truth. In this project, we aim to close this gap by establishing such conditions. In particular, the analysis revolves around the usage of probabilistic tail bounds that are developed and applied in various instances throughout the course. The problem studied in this project stands as another example, different from those seen in the course, in which tail-bounds help advance our algorithmic understanding in a probabilistic way. We provide self-contained background materials on 3D Registration</description>

      <title>Contextual Emotion Recognition using Large Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "How does the person in the bounding box feel?" Achieving human-level recognition of the apparent emotion of a person in real world situations remains an unsolved task in computer vision. Facial expressions are not enough: body pose, contextual knowledge, and commonsense reasoning all contribute to how humans perform this emotional theory of mind task. In this paper, we examine two major approaches enabled by recent large vision language models: 1) image captioning followed by a language-only LLM, and 2) vision language models, under zero-shot and fine-tuned setups. We evaluate the methods on the Emotions in Context (EMOTIC) dataset and demonstrate that a vision language model, fine-tuned even on a small dataset, can significantly outperform traditional baselines. The results of this work aim to help robots and agents perform emotionally sensitive decision-making and interaction in the future.</description>

      <title>Learning Correspondence for Deformable Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of pixelwise correspondence for deformable objects, namely cloth and rope, by comparing both classical and learning-based methods. We choose cloth and rope because they are traditionally some of the most difficult deformable objects to analytically model with their large configuration space, and they are meaningful in the context of robotic tasks like cloth folding, rope knot-tying, T-shirt folding, curtain closing, etc. The correspondence problem is heavily motivated in robotics, with wide-ranging applications including semantic grasping, object tracking, and manipulation policies built on top of correspondences. We present an exhaustive survey of existing classical methods for doing correspondence via feature-matching, including SIFT, SURF, and ORB, and two recently published learning-based methods including TimeCycle and Dense Object Nets. We make three main contributions: (1) a framework for simulating and rendering synthetic images of deformable objects, with qualitative results demonstrating transfer between our simulated and real domains (2) a new learning-based correspondence method extending Dense Object Nets, and (3) a standardized comparison across state-of-the-art correspondence methods. Our proposed method provides a flexible, general formulation for learning temporally and spatially continuous correspondences for nonrigid (and rigid) objects. We report root mean squared error statistics for all methods and find that Dense Object Nets outperforms baseline classical methods for correspondence, and our proposed extension of Dense Object Nets performs similarly.</description>

      <title>Spatial Semantic Recurrent Mining for Referring Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) consistently requires language and appearance semantics to more understand each other. The need becomes acute especially under hard situations. To achieve, existing works tend to resort to various trans-representing mechanisms to directly feed forward language semantic along main RGB branch, which however will result in referent distribution weakly-mined in space and non-referent semantic contaminated along channel. In this paper, we propose Spatial Semantic Recurrent Mining (S\textsuperscript{2}RM) to achieve high-quality cross-modality fusion. It follows a working strategy of trilogy: distributing language feature, spatial semantic recurrent coparsing, and parsed-semantic balancing. During fusion, S\textsuperscript{2}RM will first generate a constraint-weak yet distribution-aware language feature, then bundle features of each row and column from rotated features of one modality context to recurrently correlate relevant semantic contained in feature from other modality context, and finally resort to self-distilled weights to weigh on the contributions of different parsed semantics. Via coparsing, S\textsuperscript{2}RM transports information from the near and remote slice layers of generator context to the current slice layer of parsed context, capable of better modeling global relationship bidirectional and structured. Besides, we also propose a Cross-scale Abstract Semantic Guided Decoder (CASG) to emphasize the foreground of the referent, finally integrating different grained features at a comparatively low cost. Extensive experimental results on four current challenging datasets show that our proposed method performs favorably against other state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Loss Decay based Robust Oriented Object Detection on Remote Sensing Images with Noisy Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ambiguous appearance, tiny scale, and fine-grained classes of objects in remote sensing imagery inevitably lead to the noisy annotations in category labels of detection dataset. However, the effects and treatments of the label noises are underexplored in modern oriented remote sensing object detectors. To address this issue, we propose a robust oriented remote sensing object detection method through dynamic loss decay (DLD) mechanism, inspired by the two phase ``early-learning'' and ``memorization'' learning dynamics of deep neural networks on clean and noisy samples. To be specific, we first observe the end point of early learning phase termed as EL, after which the models begin to memorize the false labels that significantly degrade the detection accuracy. Secondly, under the guidance of the training indicator, the losses of each sample are ranked in descending order, and we adaptively decay the losses of the top K largest ones (bad samples) in the following epochs. Because these large losses are of high confidence to be calculated with wrong labels. Experimental results show that the method achieves excellent noise resistance performance tested on multiple public datasets such as HRSC2016 and DOTA-v1.0/v2.0 with synthetic category label noise. Our solution also has won the 2st place in the "fine-grained object detection based on sub-meter remote sensing imagery" track with noisy labels of 2023 National Big Data and Computing Intelligence Challenge.</description>

      <title>ICAL: Implicit Character-Aided Learning for Enhanced Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in the field of handwritten mathematical expression recognition, while existing encoder-decoder methods are usually difficult to model global information in \LaTeX. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel approach, Implicit Character-Aided Learning (ICAL), to mine the global expression information and enhance handwritten mathematical expression recognition. Specifically, we propose the Implicit Character Construction Module (ICCM) to predict implicit character sequences and use a Fusion Module to merge the outputs of the ICCM and the decoder, thereby producing corrected predictions. By modeling and utilizing implicit character information, ICAL achieves a more accurate and context-aware interpretation of handwritten mathematical expressions. Experimental results demonstrate that ICAL notably surpasses the state-of-the-art(SOTA) models, improving the expression recognition rate (ExpRate) by 2.21\%/1.75\%/1.28\% on the CROHME 2014/2016/2019 datasets respectively, and achieves a remarkable 69.25\% on the challenging HME100k test set.

      <title>Learning from Partial Label Proportions for Whole Slide Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the segmentation of tumor subtypes in whole slide images (WSI) by utilizing incomplete label proportions. Specifically, we utilize `partial' label proportions, which give the proportions among tumor subtypes but do not give the proportion between tumor and non-tumor. Partial label proportions are recorded as the standard diagnostic information by pathologists, and we, therefore, want to use them for realizing the segmentation model that can classify each WSI patch into one of the tumor subtypes or non-tumor. We call this problem ``learning from partial label proportions (LPLP)'' and formulate the problem as a weakly supervised learning problem. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm for this challenging problem by decomposing it into two weakly supervised learning subproblems: multiple instance learning (MIL) and learning from label proportions (LLP). These subproblems are optimized efficiently in the end-to-end manner. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated through experiments conducted on two WSI datasets.</description>

      <title>AMSNet: Netlist Dataset for AMS Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today's analog/mixed-signal (AMS) integrated circuit (IC) designs demand substantial manual intervention. The advent of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has unveiled significant potential across various fields, suggesting their applicability in streamlining large-scale AMS IC design as well. A bottleneck in employing MLLMs for automatic AMS circuit generation is the absence of a comprehensive dataset delineating the schematic-netlist relationship. We therefore design an automatic technique for converting schematics into netlists, and create dataset AMSNet, encompassing transistor-level schematics and corresponding SPICE format netlists. With a growing size, AMSNet can significantly facilitate exploration of MLLM applications in AMS circuit design. We have made an initial set of netlists public, and will make both our netlist generation tool and the full dataset available upon publishing of this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning for 3D models have propelled breakthroughs in generation, detection, and scene understanding. However, the effectiveness of these algorithms hinges on large training datasets. We address the challenge by introducing Efficient 3D Seam Carving (E3SC), a novel 3D model augmentation method based on seam carving, which progressively deforms only part of the input model while ensuring the overall semantics are unchanged. Experiments show that our approach is capable of producing diverse and high-quality augmented 3D shapes across various types and styles of input models, achieving considerable improvements over previous methods. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the novelty and quality of shapes generated by other subsequent 3D generation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Dim Small Target Detection and Tracking: A Novel Method Based on Temporal Energy Selective Scaling and Trajectory Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection and tracking of small targets in passive optical remote sensing (PORS) has broad applications. However, most of the previously proposed methods seldom utilize the abundant temporal features formed by target motion, resulting in poor detection and tracking performance for low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) targets. In this article, we analyze the difficulty based on spatial features and the feasibility based on temporal features of realizing effective detection. According to this analysis, we use a multi-frame as a detection unit and propose a detection method based on temporal energy selective scaling (TESS). Specifically, we investigated the composition of intensity temporal profiles (ITPs) formed by pixels on a multi-frame detection unit. For the target-present pixel, the target passing through the pixel will bring a weak transient disturbance on the ITP and introduce a change in the statistical properties of ITP. We use a well-designed function to amplify the transient disturbance, suppress the background and noise components, and output the trajectory of the target on the multi-frame detection unit. Subsequently, to solve the contradiction between the detection rate and the false alarm rate brought by the traditional threshold segmentation, we associate the temporal and spatial features of the output trajectory and propose a trajectory extraction method based on the 3D Hough transform. Finally, we model the trajectory of the target and propose a trajectory-based multi-target tracking method. Compared with the various state-of-the-art detection and tracking methods, experiments in multiple scenarios prove the superiority of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>CTS: A Consistency-Based Medical Image Segmentation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In medical image segmentation tasks, diffusion models have shown significant potential. However, mainstream diffusion models suffer from drawbacks such as multiple sampling times and slow prediction results. Recently, consistency models, as a standalone generative network, have resolved this issue. Compared to diffusion models, consistency models can reduce the sampling times to once, not only achieving similar generative effects but also significantly speeding up training and prediction. However, they are not suitable for image segmentation tasks, and their application in the medical imaging field has not yet been explored. Therefore, this paper applies the consistency model to medical image segmentation tasks, designing multi-scale feature signal supervision modes and loss function guidance to achieve model convergence. Experiments have verified that the CTS model can obtain better medical image segmentation results with a single sampling during the test phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although face analysis has achieved remarkable improvements in the past few years, designing a multi-task face analysis model is still challenging. Most face analysis tasks are studied as separate problems and do not benefit from the synergy among related tasks. In this work, we propose a novel task-adaptive multi-task face analysis method named as Q-Face, which simultaneously performs multiple face analysis tasks with a unified model. We fuse the features from multiple layers of a large-scale pre-trained model so that the whole model can use both local and global facial information to support multiple tasks. Furthermore, we design a task-adaptive module that performs cross-attention between a set of query vectors and the fused multi-stage features and finally adaptively extracts desired features for each face analysis task. Extensive experiments show that our method can perform multiple tasks simultaneously and achieves state-of-the-art performance on face expression recognition, action unit detection, face attribute analysis, age estimation, and face pose estimation. Compared to conventional methods, our method opens up new possibilities for multi-task face analysis and shows the potential for both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>RSHazeDiff: A Unified Fourier-aware Diffusion Model for Remote Sensing Image Dehazing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Haze severely degrades the visual quality of remote sensing images and hampers the performance of automotive navigation, intelligent monitoring, and urban management. The emerging denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) exhibits the significant potential for dense haze removal with its strong generation ability. Since remote sensing images contain extensive small-scale texture structures, it is important to effectively restore image details from hazy images. However, current wisdom of DDPM fails to preserve image details and color fidelity well, limiting its dehazing capacity for remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a novel unified Fourier-aware diffusion model for remote sensing image dehazing, termed RSHazeDiff. From a new perspective, RSHazeDiff explores the conditional DDPM to improve image quality in dense hazy scenarios, and it makes three key contributions. First, RSHazeDiff refines the training phase of diffusion process by performing noise estimation and reconstruction constraints in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Thus, it remedies the unpleasing results caused by the simple noise estimation constraint in DDPM. Second, by taking the frequency information as important prior knowledge during iterative sampling steps, RSHazeDiff can preserve more texture details and color fidelity in dehazed images. Third, we design a global compensated learning module to utilize the Fourier transform to capture the global dependency features of input images, which can effectively mitigate the effects of boundary artifacts when processing fixed-size patches. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the favorable performance of RSHazeDiff over multiple state-of-the-art methods. Source code will be released at https://github.com/jm-xiong/RSHazeDiff.</description>

      <title>SOEDiff: Efficient Distillation for Small Object Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we delve into a new task known as small object editing (SOE), which focuses on text-based image inpainting within a constrained, small-sized area. Despite the remarkable success have been achieved by current image inpainting approaches, their application to the SOE task generally results in failure cases such as Object Missing, Text-Image Mismatch, and Distortion. These failures stem from the limited use of small-sized objects in training datasets and the downsampling operations employed by U-Net models, which hinders accurate generation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel training-based approach, SOEDiff, aimed at enhancing the capability of baseline models like StableDiffusion in editing small-sized objects while minimizing training costs. Specifically, our method involves two key components: SO-LoRA, which efficiently fine-tunes low-rank matrices, and Cross-Scale Score Distillation loss, which leverages high-resolution predictions from the pre-trained teacher diffusion model. Our method presents significant improvements on the test dataset collected from MSCOCO and OpenImage, validating the effectiveness of our proposed method in small object editing. In particular, when comparing SOEDiff with SD-I model on the OpenImage-f dataset, we observe a 0.99 improvement in CLIP-Score and a reduction of 2.87 in FID.

      <title>HAAP: Vision-context Hierarchical Attention Autoregressive with Adaptive Permutation for Scene Text Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internal Language Model (LM)-based methods use permutation language modeling (PLM) to solve the error correction caused by conditional independence in external LM-based methods. However, random permutations of human interference cause fit oscillations in the model training, and Iterative Refinement (IR) operation to improve multimodal information decoupling also introduces additional overhead. To address these issues, this paper proposes the Hierarchical Attention autoregressive Model with Adaptive Permutation (HAAP) to enhance the location-context-image interaction capability, improving autoregressive generalization with internal LM. First, we propose Implicit Permutation Neurons (IPN) to generate adaptive attention masks to dynamically exploit token dependencies. The adaptive masks increase the diversity of training data and prevent model dependency on a specific order. It reduces the training overhead of PLM while avoiding training fit oscillations. Second, we develop Cross-modal Hierarchical Attention mechanism (CHA) to couple context and image features. This processing establishes rich positional semantic dependencies between context and image while avoiding IR. Extensive experimental results show the proposed HAAP achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in terms of accuracy, complexity, and latency on several datasets.</description>

      <title>RobustMVS: Single Domain Generalized Deep Multi-view Stereo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of Multi-view Stereo (MVS) approaches given plenty of training samples, the performance degradation when generalizing to unseen domains has not been clearly explored yet. In this work, we focus on the domain generalization problem in MVS. To evaluate the generalization results, we build a novel MVS domain generalization benchmark including synthetic and real-world datasets. In contrast to conventional domain generalization benchmarks, we consider a more realistic but challenging scenario, where only one source domain is available for training. The MVS problem can be analogized back to the feature matching task, and maintaining robust feature consistency among views is an important factor for improving generalization performance. To address the domain generalization problem in MVS, we propose a novel MVS framework, namely RobustMVS. A DepthClustering-guided Whitening (DCW) loss is further introduced to preserve the feature consistency among different views, which decorrelates multi-view features from viewpoint-specific style information based on geometric priors from depth maps. The experimental results further show that our method achieves superior performance on the domain generalization benchmark.</description>

      <title>OpenGait: A Comprehensive Benchmark Study for Gait Recognition towards Better Practicality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gait recognition, a rapidly advancing vision technology for person identification from a distance, has made significant strides in indoor settings. However, evidence suggests that existing methods often yield unsatisfactory results when applied to newly released real-world gait datasets. Furthermore, conclusions drawn from indoor gait datasets may not easily generalize to outdoor ones. Therefore, the primary goal of this work is to present a comprehensive benchmark study aimed at improving practicality rather than solely focusing on enhancing performance. To this end, we first develop OpenGait, a flexible and efficient gait recognition platform. Using OpenGait as a foundation, we conduct in-depth ablation experiments to revisit recent developments in gait recognition. Surprisingly, we detect some imperfect parts of certain prior methods thereby resulting in several critical yet undiscovered insights. Inspired by these findings, we develop three structurally simple yet empirically powerful and practically robust baseline models, i.e., DeepGaitV2, SkeletonGait, and SkeletonGait++, respectively representing the appearance-based, model-based, and multi-modal methodology for gait pattern description. Beyond achieving SoTA performances, more importantly, our careful exploration sheds new light on the modeling experience of deep gait models, the representational capacity of typical gait modalities, and so on. We hope this work can inspire further research and application of gait recognition towards better practicality. The code is available at https://github.com/ShiqiYu/OpenGait.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchically Feature Reconstructed Autoencoder for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization without any manual annotations and prior knowledge is a challenging task under the setting of unsupervised learning. The existing works achieve excellent performance in the anomaly detection, but with complex networks or cumbersome pipelines. To address this issue, this paper explores a simple but effective architecture in the anomaly detection. It consists of a well pre-trained encoder to extract hierarchical feature representations and a decoder to reconstruct these intermediate features from the encoder. In particular, it does not require any data augmentations and anomalous images for training. The anomalies can be detected when the decoder fails to reconstruct features well, and then errors of hierarchical feature reconstruction are aggregated into an anomaly map to achieve anomaly localization. The difference comparison between those features of encoder and decode lead to more accurate and robust localization results than the comparison in single feature or pixel-by-pixel comparison in the conventional works. Experiment results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and MVTec Anomaly Detection datasets on both anomaly detection and localization.</description>

      <title>Curriculum Dataset Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most dataset distillation methods struggle to accommodate large-scale datasets due to their substantial computational and memory requirements. In this paper, we present a curriculum-based dataset distillation framework designed to harmonize scalability with efficiency. This framework strategically distills synthetic images, adhering to a curriculum that transitions from simple to complex. By incorporating curriculum evaluation, we address the issue of previous methods generating images that tend to be homogeneous and simplistic, doing so at a manageable computational cost. Furthermore, we introduce adversarial optimization towards synthetic images to further improve their representativeness and safeguard against their overfitting to the neural network involved in distilling. This enhances the generalization capability of the distilled images across various neural network architectures and also increases their robustness to noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework sets new benchmarks in large-scale dataset distillation, achieving substantial improvements of 11.1\% on Tiny-ImageNet, 9.0\% on ImageNet-1K, and 7.3\% on ImageNet-21K. The source code will be released to the community.</description>

      <title>Scalable Image Coding for Humans and Machines Using Feature Fusion Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As image recognition models become more prevalent, scalable coding methods for machines and humans gain more importance. Applications of image recognition models include traffic monitoring and farm management. In these use cases, the scalable coding method proves effective because the tasks require occasional image checking by humans. Existing image compression methods for humans and machines meet these requirements to some extent. However, these compression methods are effective solely for specific image recognition models. We propose a learning-based scalable image coding method for humans and machines that is compatible with numerous image recognition models. We combine an image compression model for machines with a compression model, providing additional information to facilitate image decoding for humans. The features in these compression models are fused using a feature fusion network to achieve efficient image compression. Our method's additional information compression model is adjusted to reduce the number of parameters by enabling combinations of features of different sizes in the feature fusion network. Our approach confirms that the feature fusion network efficiently combines image compression models while reducing the number of parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scalable coding method by evaluating the image compression performance in terms of decoded image quality and bitrate.</description>

      <title>Flexible image analysis for law enforcement agencies with deep neural networks to determine: where, who and what</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the increasing need for effective security measures and the integration of cameras in commercial products, a hugeamount of visual data is created today. Law enforcement agencies (LEAs) are inspecting images and videos to findradicalization, propaganda for terrorist organizations and illegal products on darknet markets. This is time consuming.Instead of an undirected search, LEAs would like to adapt to new crimes and threats, and focus only on data from specificlocations, persons or objects, which requires flexible interpretation of image content. Visual concept detection with deepconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a crucial component to understand the image content. This paper has fivecontributions. The first contribution allows image-based geo-localization to estimate the origin of an image. CNNs andgeotagged images are used to create a model that determines the location of an image by its pixel values. The secondcontribution enables analysis of fine-grained concepts to distinguish sub-categories in a generic concept. The proposedmethod encompasses data acquisition and cleaning and concept hierarchies. The third contribution is the recognition ofperson attributes (e.g., glasses or moustache) to enable query by textual description for a person. The person-attributeproblem is treated as a specific sub-task of concept classification. The fourth contribution is an intuitive image annotationtool based on active learning. Active learning allows users to define novel concepts flexibly and train CNNs with minimalannotation effort. The fifth contribution increases the flexibility for LEAs in the query definition by using query expansion.Query expansion maps user queries to known and detectable concepts. Therefore, no prior knowledge of the detectableconcepts is required for the users. The methods are validated on data with varying locations (popular and non-touristiclocations), varying person attributes (CelebA dataset), and varying number of annotations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Xmodel-VLM, a cutting-edge multimodal vision language model. It is designed for efficient deployment on consumer GPU servers. Our work directly confronts a pivotal industry issue by grappling with the prohibitive service costs that hinder the broad adoption of large-scale multimodal systems. Through rigorous training, we have developed a 1B-scale language model from the ground up, employing the LLaVA paradigm for modal alignment. The result, which we call Xmodel-VLM, is a lightweight yet powerful multimodal vision language model. Extensive testing across numerous classic multimodal benchmarks has revealed that despite its smaller size and faster execution, Xmodel-VLM delivers performance comparable to that of larger models. Our model checkpoints and code are publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/XiaoduoAILab/XmodelVLM.</description>

Abstract: The graph neural networks has been proved to be an efficient machine learning technique in real life applications. The handwritten recognition is one of the useful area in real life use where both offline and online handwriting recognition are required. The chain code as feature extraction technique has shown significant results in literature and we have been able to use chain codes with graph neural networks. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents first time a novel combination of handwritten trajectories features as chain codes and graph neural networks together. The handwritten trajectories for offline handwritten text has been evaluated using recovery of drawing order, whereas online handwritten trajectories are directly used with chain codes. Our results prove that present combination surpass previous results and minimize error rate in few epochs only.</description>

      <title>Dance Any Beat: Blending Beats with Visuals in Dance Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of generating dance from music is crucial, yet current methods, which mainly produce joint sequences, lead to outputs that lack intuitiveness and complicate data collection due to the necessity for precise joint annotations. We introduce a Dance Any Beat Diffusion model, namely DabFusion, that employs music as a conditional input to directly create dance videos from still images, utilizing conditional image-to-video generation principles. This approach pioneers the use of music as a conditioning factor in image-to-video synthesis. Our method unfolds in two stages: training an auto-encoder to predict latent optical flow between reference and driving frames, eliminating the need for joint annotation, and training a U-Net-based diffusion model to produce these latent optical flows guided by music rhythm encoded by CLAP. Although capable of producing high-quality dance videos, the baseline model struggles with rhythm alignment. We enhance the model by adding beat information, improving synchronization. We introduce a 2D motion-music alignment score (2D-MM Align) for quantitative assessment. Evaluated on the AIST++ dataset, our enhanced model shows marked improvements in 2D-MM Align score and established metrics. Video results can be found on our project page: https://DabFusion.github.io.</description>

      <title>DeCoDEx: Confounder Detector Guidance for Improved Diffusion-based Counterfactual Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning classifiers are prone to latching onto dominant confounders present in a dataset rather than on the causal markers associated with the target class, leading to poor generalization and biased predictions. Although explainability via counterfactual image generation has been successful at exposing the problem, bias mitigation strategies that permit accurate explainability in the presence of dominant and diverse artifacts remain unsolved. In this work, we propose the DeCoDEx framework and show how an external, pre-trained binary artifact detector can be leveraged during inference to guide a diffusion-based counterfactual image generator towards accurate explainability. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset, using both synthetic artifacts and real visual artifacts (support devices), show that the proposed method successfully synthesizes the counterfactual images that change the causal pathology markers associated with Pleural Effusion while preserving or ignoring the visual artifacts. Augmentation of ERM and Group-DRO classifiers with the DeCoDEx generated images substantially improves the results across underrepresented groups that are out of distribution for each class.

      <title>Sensitivity Decouple Learning for Image Compression Artifacts Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the benefit of deep learning techniques, recent researches have made significant progress in image compression artifacts reduction. Despite their improved performances, prevailing methods only focus on learning a mapping from the compressed image to the original one but ignore the intrinsic attributes of the given compressed images, which greatly harms the performance of downstream parsing tasks. Different from these methods, we propose to decouple the intrinsic attributes into two complementary features for artifacts reduction,ie, the compression-insensitive features to regularize the high-level semantic representations during training and the compression-sensitive features to be aware of the compression degree. To achieve this, we first employ adversarial training to regularize the compressed and original encoded features for retaining high-level semantics, and we then develop the compression quality-aware feature encoder for compression-sensitive features. Based on these dual complementary features, we propose a Dual Awareness Guidance Network (DAGN) to utilize these awareness features as transformation guidance during the decoding phase. In our proposed DAGN, we develop a cross-feature fusion module to maintain the consistency of compression-insensitive features by fusing compression-insensitive features into the artifacts reduction baseline. Our method achieves an average 2.06 dB PSNR gains on BSD500, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, and only requires 29.7 ms to process one image on BSD500. Besides, the experimental results on LIVE1 and LIU4K also demonstrate the efficiency, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed method in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, and downstream machine vision tasks.</description>

      <title>ReconBoost: Boosting Can Achieve Modality Reconcilement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a novel multi-modal alternating learning paradigm pursuing a reconciliation between the exploitation of uni-modal features and the exploration of cross-modal interactions. This is motivated by the fact that current paradigms of multi-modal learning tend to explore multi-modal features simultaneously. The resulting gradient prohibits further exploitation of the features in the weak modality, leading to modality competition, where the dominant modality overpowers the learning process. To address this issue, we study the modality-alternating learning paradigm to achieve reconcilement. Specifically, we propose a new method called ReconBoost to update a fixed modality each time. Herein, the learning objective is dynamically adjusted with a reconcilement regularization against competition with the historical models. By choosing a KL-based reconcilement, we show that the proposed method resembles Friedman's Gradient-Boosting (GB) algorithm, where the updated learner can correct errors made by others and help enhance the overall performance. The major difference with the classic GB is that we only preserve the newest model for each modality to avoid overfitting caused by ensembling strong learners. Furthermore, we propose a memory consolidation scheme and a global rectification scheme to make this strategy more effective. Experiments over six multi-modal benchmarks speak to the efficacy of the method. We release the code at https://github.com/huacong/ReconBoost.</description>

      <title>Application of Gated Recurrent Units for CT Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in computed tomography (CT) imaging, especially with dual-robot systems, have introduced new challenges for scan trajectory optimization. This paper presents a novel approach using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to optimize CT scan trajectories. Our approach exploits the flexibility of robotic CT systems to select projections that enhance image quality by improving resolution and contrast while reducing scan time. We focus on cone-beam CT and employ several projection-based metrics, including absorption, pixel intensities, contrast-to-noise ratio, and data completeness. The GRU network aims to minimize data redundancy and maximize completeness with a limited number of projections. We validate our method using simulated data of a test specimen, focusing on a specific voxel of interest. The results show that the GRU-optimized scan trajectories can outperform traditional circular CT trajectories in terms of image quality metrics. For the used specimen, SSIM improves from 0.38 to 0.49 and CNR increases from 6.97 to 9.08. This finding suggests that the application of GRU in CT scan trajectory optimization can lead to more efficient, cost-effective, and high-quality imaging solutions.</description>

      <title>Content-Based Image Retrieval for Multi-Class Volumetric Radiology Images: A Benchmark Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has been extensively studied in natural image retrieval, its application to medical images presents ongoing challenges, primarily due to the 3D nature of medical images. Recent studies have shown the potential use of pre-trained vision embeddings for CBIR in the context of radiology image retrieval. However, a benchmark for the retrieval of 3D volumetric medical images is still lacking, hindering the ability to objectively evaluate and compare the efficiency of proposed CBIR approaches in medical imaging. In this study, we extend previous work and establish a benchmark for region-based and multi-organ retrieval using the TotalSegmentator dataset (TS) with detailed multi-organ annotations. We benchmark embeddings derived from pre-trained supervised models on medical images against embeddings derived from pre-trained unsupervised models on non-medical images for 29 coarse and 104 detailed anatomical structures in volume and region levels. We adopt a late interaction re-ranking method inspired by text matching for image retrieval, comparing it against the original method proposed for volume and region retrieval achieving retrieval recall of 1.0 for diverse anatomical regions with a wide size range. The findings and methodologies presented in this paper provide essential insights and benchmarks for the development and evaluation of CBIR approaches in the context of medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Progressive Depth Decoupling and Modulating for Flexible Depth Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image-guided depth completion aims at generating a dense depth map from sparse LiDAR data and RGB image. Recent methods have shown promising performance by reformulating it as a classification problem with two sub-tasks: depth discretization and probability prediction. They divide the depth range into several discrete depth values as depth categories, serving as priors for scene depth distributions. However, previous depth discretization methods are easy to be impacted by depth distribution variations across different scenes, resulting in suboptimal scene depth distribution priors. To address the above problem, we propose a progressive depth decoupling and modulating network, which incrementally decouples the depth range into bins and adaptively generates multi-scale dense depth maps in multiple stages. Specifically, we first design a Bins Initializing Module (BIM) to construct the seed bins by exploring the depth distribution information within a sparse depth map, adapting variations of depth distribution. Then, we devise an incremental depth decoupling branch to progressively refine the depth distribution information from global to local. Meanwhile, an adaptive depth modulating branch is developed to progressively improve the probability representation from coarse-grained to fine-grained. And the bi-directional information interactions are proposed to strengthen the information interaction between those two branches (sub-tasks) for promoting information complementation in each branch. Further, we introduce a multi-scale supervision mechanism to learn the depth distribution information in latent features and enhance the adaptation capability across different scenes. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The code will be open-sourced at [this https URL](https://github.com/Cisse-away/PDDM).</description>

      <title>Vision-Based Neurosurgical Guidance: Unsupervised Localization and Camera-Pose Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localizing oneself during endoscopic procedures can be problematic due to the lack of distinguishable textures and landmarks, as well as difficulties due to the endoscopic device such as a limited field of view and challenging lighting conditions. Expert knowledge shaped by years of experience is required for localization within the human body during endoscopic procedures. In this work, we present a deep learning method based on anatomy recognition, that constructs a surgical path in an unsupervised manner from surgical videos, modelling relative location and variations due to different viewing angles. At inference time, the model can map an unseen video's frames on the path and estimate the viewing angle, aiming to provide guidance, for instance, to reach a particular destination. We test the method on a dataset consisting of surgical videos of transsphenoidal adenomectomies, as well as on a synthetic dataset. An online tool that lets researchers upload their surgical videos to obtain anatomy detections and the weights of the trained YOLOv7 model are available at: https://surgicalvision.bmic.ethz.ch.</description>

      <title>SARATR-X: A Foundation Model for Synthetic Aperture Radar Images Target Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is essential in actively acquiring information for Earth observation. SAR Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) focuses on detecting and classifying various target categories under different image conditions. The current deep learning-based SAR ATR methods are typically designed for specific datasets and applications. Various target characteristics, scene background information, and sensor parameters across ATR datasets challenge the generalization of those methods. This paper aims to achieve general SAR ATR based on a foundation model with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). Our motivation is to break through the specific dataset and condition limitations and obtain universal perceptual capabilities across the target, scene, and sensor. A foundation model named SARATR-X is proposed with the following four aspects: pre-training dataset, model backbone, SSL, and evaluation task. First, we integrated 14 datasets with various target categories and imaging conditions as a pre-training dataset. Second, different model backbones were discussed to find the most suitable approaches for remote-sensing images. Third, we applied two-stage training and SAR gradient features to ensure the diversity and scalability of SARATR-X. Finally, SARATR-X has achieved competitive and superior performance on 5 datasets with 8 task settings, which shows that the foundation model can achieve universal SAR ATR. We believe it is time to embrace fundamental models for SAR image interpretation in the era of increasing big data.</description>

      <title>Identity Overlap Between Face Recognition Train/Test Data: Causing Optimistic Bias in Accuracy Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental tenet of pattern recognition is that overlap between training and testing sets causes an optimistic accuracy estimate. Deep CNNs for face recognition are trained for N-way classification of the identities in the training set. Accuracy is commonly estimated as average 10-fold classification accuracy on image pairs from test sets such as LFW, CALFW, CPLFW, CFP-FP and AgeDB-30. Because train and test sets have been independently assembled, images and identities in any given test set may also be present in any given training set. In particular, our experiments reveal a surprising degree of identity and image overlap between the LFW family of test sets and the MS1MV2 training set. Our experiments also reveal identity label noise in MS1MV2. We compare accuracy achieved with same-size MS1MV2 subsets that are identity-disjoint and not identity-disjoint with LFW, to reveal the size of the optimistic bias. Using more challenging test sets from the LFW family, we find that the size of the optimistic bias is larger for more challenging test sets. Our results highlight the lack of and the need for identity-disjoint train and test methodology in face recognition research.</description>

      <title>Time-Equivariant Contrastive Learning for Degenerative Disease Progression in Retinal OCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive pretraining provides robust representations by ensuring their invariance to different image transformations while simultaneously preventing representational collapse. Equivariant contrastive learning, on the other hand, provides representations sensitive to specific image transformations while remaining invariant to others. By introducing equivariance to time-induced transformations, such as disease-related anatomical changes in longitudinal imaging, the model can effectively capture such changes in the representation space. In this work, we pro-pose a Time-equivariant Contrastive Learning (TC) method. First, an encoder embeds two unlabeled scans from different time points of the same patient into the representation space. Next, a temporal equivariance module is trained to predict the representation of a later visit based on the representation from one of the previous visits and the corresponding time interval with a novel regularization loss term while preserving the invariance property to irrelevant image transformations. On a large longitudinal dataset, our model clearly outperforms existing equivariant contrastive methods in predicting progression from intermediate age-related macular degeneration (AMD) to advanced wet-AMD within a specified time-window.</description>

      <title>Real-World Federated Learning in Radiology: Hurdles to overcome and Benefits to gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while keeping data locally. Currently, most FL studies in radiology are conducted in simulated environments due to numerous hurdles impeding its translation into practice. The few existing real-world FL initiatives rarely communicate specific measures taken to overcome these hurdles, leaving behind a significant knowledge gap. Minding efforts to implement real-world FL, there is a notable lack of comprehensive assessment comparing FL to less complex alternatives. Materials &amp; Methods: We extensively reviewed FL literature, categorizing insights along with our findings according to their nature and phase while establishing a FL initiative, summarized to a comprehensive guide. We developed our own FL infrastructure within the German Radiological Cooperative Network (RACOON) and demonstrated its functionality by training FL models on lung pathology segmentation tasks across six university hospitals. We extensively evaluated FL against less complex alternatives in three distinct evaluation scenarios. Results: The proposed guide outlines essential steps, identified hurdles, and proposed solutions for establishing successful FL initiatives conducting real-world experiments. Our experimental results show that FL outperforms less complex alternatives in all evaluation scenarios, justifying the effort required to translate FL into real-world applications. Discussion &amp; Conclusion: Our proposed guide aims to aid future FL researchers in circumventing pitfalls and accelerating translation of FL into radiological applications. Our results underscore the value of efforts needed to translate FL into real-world applications by demonstrating advantageous performance over alternatives, and emphasize the importance of strategic organization, robust management of distributed data and infrastructure in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Global-Local Image Perceptual Score (GLIPS): Evaluating Photorealistic Quality of AI-Generated Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Global-Local Image Perceptual Score (GLIPS), an image metric designed to assess the photorealistic image quality of AI-generated images with a high degree of alignment to human visual perception. Traditional metrics such as FID and KID scores do not align closely with human evaluations. The proposed metric incorporates advanced transformer-based attention mechanisms to assess local similarity and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to evaluate global distributional similarity. To evaluate the performance of GLIPS, we conducted a human study on photorealistic image quality. Comprehensive tests across various generative models demonstrate that GLIPS consistently outperforms existing metrics like FID, SSIM, and MS-SSIM in terms of correlation with human scores. Additionally, we introduce the Interpolative Binning Scale (IBS), a refined scaling method that enhances the interpretability of metric scores by aligning them more closely with human evaluative standards. The proposed metric and scaling approach not only provides more reliable assessments of AI-generated images but also suggest pathways for future enhancements in image generation technologies.</description>

      <title>A Survey On Text-to-3D Contents Generation In The Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D content creation plays a vital role in various applications, such as gaming, robotics simulation, and virtual reality. However, the process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, requiring skilled designers to invest considerable effort in creating a single 3D asset. To address this challenge, text-to-3D generation technologies have emerged as a promising solution for automating 3D creation. Leveraging the success of large vision language models, these techniques aim to generate 3D content based on textual descriptions. Despite recent advancements in this area, existing solutions still face significant limitations in terms of generation quality and efficiency. In this survey, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the latest text-to-3D creation methods. We provide a comprehensive background on text-to-3D creation, including discussions on datasets employed in training and evaluation metrics used to assess the quality of generated 3D models. Then, we delve into the various 3D representations that serve as the foundation for the 3D generation process. Furthermore, we present a thorough comparison of the rapidly growing literature on generative pipelines, categorizing them into feedforward generators, optimization-based generation, and view reconstruction approaches. By examining the strengths and weaknesses of these methods, we aim to shed light on their respective capabilities and limitations. Lastly, we point out several promising avenues for future research. With this survey, we hope to inspire researchers further to explore the potential of open-vocabulary text-conditioned 3D content creation.</description>

      <title>Fourier Boundary Features Network with Wider Catchers for Glass Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glass largely blurs the boundary between the real world and the reflection. The special transmittance and reflectance quality have confused the semantic tasks related to machine vision. Therefore, how to clear the boundary built by glass, and avoid over-capturing features as false positive information in deep structure, matters for constraining the segmentation of reflection surface and penetrating glass. We proposed the Fourier Boundary Features Network with Wider Catchers (FBWC), which might be the first attempt to utilize sufficiently wide horizontal shallow branches without vertical deepening for guiding the fine granularity segmentation boundary through primary glass semantic information. Specifically, we designed the Wider Coarse-Catchers (WCC) for anchoring large area segmentation and reducing excessive extraction from a structural perspective. We embed fine-grained features by Cross Transpose Attention (CTA), which is introduced to avoid the incomplete area within the boundary caused by reflection noise. For excavating glass features and balancing high-low layers context, a learnable Fourier Convolution Controller (FCC) is proposed to regulate information integration robustly. The proposed method has been validated on three different public glass segmentation datasets. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method yields better segmentation performance compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in glass image segmentation.</description>

      <title>Gaze-DETR: Using Expert Gaze to Reduce False Positives in Vulvovaginal Candidiasis Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate detection of vulvovaginal candidiasis is critical for women's health, yet its sparse distribution and visually ambiguous characteristics pose significant challenges for accurate identification by pathologists and neural networks alike. Our eye-tracking data reveals that areas garnering sustained attention - yet not marked by experts after deliberation - are often aligned with false positives of neural networks. Leveraging this finding, we introduce Gaze-DETR, a pioneering method that integrates gaze data to enhance neural network precision by diminishing false positives. Gaze-DETR incorporates a universal gaze-guided warm-up protocol applicable across various detection methods and a gaze-guided rectification strategy specifically designed for DETR-based models. Our comprehensive tests confirm that Gaze-DETR surpasses existing leading methods, showcasing remarkable improvements in detection accuracy and generalizability.</description>

      <title>Color Space Learning for Cross-Color Person Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary color profile of the same identity is assumed to remain consistent in typical Person Re-identification (Person ReID) tasks. However, this assumption may be invalid in real-world situations and images hold variant color profiles, because of cross-modality cameras or identity with different clothing. To address this issue, we propose Color Space Learning (CSL) for those Cross-Color Person ReID problems. Specifically, CSL guides the model to be less color-sensitive with two modules: Image-level Color-Augmentation and Pixel-level Color-Transformation. The first module increases the color diversity of the inputs and guides the model to focus more on the non-color information. The second module projects every pixel of input images onto a new color space. In addition, we introduce a new Person ReID benchmark across RGB and Infrared modalities, NTU-Corridor, which is the first with privacy agreements from all participants. To evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed CSL, we evaluate it on several Cross-Color Person ReID benchmarks. Our method surpasses the state-of-the-art methods consistently. The code and benchmark are available at: https://github.com/niejiahao1998/CSL</description>

      <title>Classifying geospatial objects from multiview aerial imagery using semantic meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerial imagery is increasingly used in Earth science and natural resource management as a complement to labor-intensive ground-based surveys. Aerial systems can collect overlapping images that provide multiple views of each location from different perspectives. However, most prediction approaches (e.g. for tree species classification) use a single, synthesized top-down "orthomosaic" image as input that contains little to no information about the vertical aspects of objects and may include processing artifacts. We propose an alternate approach that generates predictions directly on the raw images and accurately maps these predictions into geospatial coordinates using semantic meshes. This method$\unicode{x2013}$released as a user-friendly open-source toolkit$\unicode{x2013}$enables analysts to use the highest quality data for predictions, capture information about the sides of objects, and leverage multiple viewpoints of each location for added robustness. We demonstrate the value of this approach on a new benchmark dataset of four forest sites in the western U.S. that consists of drone images, photogrammetry results, predicted tree locations, and species classification data derived from manual surveys. We show that our proposed multiview method improves classification accuracy from 53% to 75% relative to an orthomosaic baseline on a challenging cross-site tree species classification task.</description>

      <title>BEHAVIOR Vision Suite: Customizable Dataset Generation via Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The systematic evaluation and understanding of computer vision models under varying conditions require large amounts of data with comprehensive and customized labels, which real-world vision datasets rarely satisfy. While current synthetic data generators offer a promising alternative, particularly for embodied AI tasks, they often fall short for computer vision tasks due to low asset and rendering quality, limited diversity, and unrealistic physical properties. We introduce the BEHAVIOR Vision Suite (BVS), a set of tools and assets to generate fully customized synthetic data for systematic evaluation of computer vision models, based on the newly developed embodied AI benchmark, BEHAVIOR-1K. BVS supports a large number of adjustable parameters at the scene level (e.g., lighting, object placement), the object level (e.g., joint configuration, attributes such as "filled" and "folded"), and the camera level (e.g., field of view, focal length). Researchers can arbitrarily vary these parameters during data generation to perform controlled experiments. We showcase three example application scenarios: systematically evaluating the robustness of models across different continuous axes of domain shift, evaluating scene understanding models on the same set of images, and training and evaluating simulation-to-real transfer for a novel vision task: unary and binary state prediction.

      <title>Neural Collapse Meets Differential Privacy: Curious Behaviors of NoisyGD with Near-perfect Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent study by De et al. (2022) has reported that large-scale representation learning through pre-training on a public dataset significantly enhances differentially private (DP) learning in downstream tasks, despite the high dimensionality of the feature space. To theoretically explain this phenomenon, we consider the setting of a layer-peeled model in representation learning, which results in interesting phenomena related to learned features in deep learning and transfer learning, known as Neural Collapse (NC).
  Within the framework of NC, we establish an error bound indicating that the misclassification error is independent of dimension when the distance between actual features and the ideal ones is smaller than a threshold. Additionally, the quality of the features in the last layer is empirically evaluated under different pre-trained models within the framework of NC, showing that a more powerful transformer leads to a better feature representation. Furthermore, we reveal that DP fine-tuning is less robust compared to fine-tuning without DP, particularly in the presence of perturbations. These observations are supported by both theoretical analyses and experimental evaluation. Moreover, to enhance the robustness of DP fine-tuning, we suggest several strategies, such as feature normalization or employing dimension reduction methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Empirically, we demonstrate a significant improvement in testing accuracy by conducting PCA on the last-layer features.</description>

      <title>Impact of Design Decisions in Scanpath Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling visual saliency in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) allows to understand how people perceive GUI designs and what elements attract their attention. One aspect that is often overlooked is the fact that computational models depend on a series of design parameters that are not straightforward to decide. We systematically analyze how different design parameters affect scanpath evaluation metrics using a state-of-the-art computational model (DeepGaze++). We particularly focus on three design parameters: input image size, inhibition-of-return decay, and masking radius. We show that even small variations of these design parameters have a noticeable impact on standard evaluation metrics such as DTW or Eyenalysis. These effects also occur in other scanpath models, such as UMSS and ScanGAN, and in other datasets such as MASSVIS. Taken together, our results put forward the impact of design decisions for predicting users' viewing behavior on GUIs.</description>

      <title>Perception Without Vision for Trajectory Prediction: Ego Vehicle Dynamics as Scene Representation for Efficient Active Learning in Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the use of trajectory and dynamic state information for efficient data curation in autonomous driving machine learning tasks. We propose methods for clustering trajectory-states and sampling strategies in an active learning framework, aiming to reduce annotation and data costs while maintaining model performance. Our approach leverages trajectory information to guide data selection, promoting diversity in the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on the trajectory prediction task using the nuScenes dataset, showing consistent performance gains over random sampling across different data pool sizes, and even reaching sub-baseline displacement errors at just 50% of the data cost. Our results suggest that sampling typical data initially helps overcome the ''cold start problem,'' while introducing novelty becomes more beneficial as the training pool size increases. By integrating trajectory-state-informed active learning, we demonstrate that more efficient and robust autonomous driving systems are possible and practical using low-cost data curation strategies.</description>

      <title>Compressive Feature Selection for Remote Visual Multi-Task Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep models produce a number of features in each internal layer. A key problem in applications such as feature compression for remote inference is determining how important each feature is for the task(s) performed by the model. The problem is especially challenging in the case of multi-task inference, where the same feature may carry different importance for different tasks. In this paper, we examine how effective is mutual information (MI) between a feature and a model's task output as a measure of the feature's importance for that task. Experiments involving hard selection and soft selection (unequal compression) based on MI are carried out to compare the MI-based method with alternative approaches. Multi-objective analysis is provided to offer further insight.</description>

      <title>MVBIND: Self-Supervised Music Recommendation For Videos Via Embedding Space Binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of short videos, which usually contain both visual and audio modalities. Background music is important to the short videos, which can significantly influence the emotions of the viewers. However, at present, the background music of short videos is generally chosen by the video producer, and there is a lack of automatic music recommendation methods for short videos. This paper introduces MVBind, an innovative Music-Video embedding space Binding model for cross-modal retrieval. MVBind operates as a self-supervised approach, acquiring inherent knowledge of intermodal relationships directly from data, without the need of manual annotations. Additionally, to compensate the lack of a corresponding musical-visual pair dataset for short videos, we construct a dataset, SVM-10K(Short Video with Music-10K), which mainly consists of meticulously selected short videos. On this dataset, MVBind manifests significantly improved performance compared to other baseline methods. The constructed dataset and code will be released to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Deep Blur Multi-Model (DeepBlurMM) -- a strategy to mitigate the impact of image blur on deep learning model performance in histopathology image analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-based analysis of histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) is central in computational pathology. However, image quality can impact model performance. Here, we investigate to what extent unsharp areas of WSIs impact deep convolutional neural network classification performance. We propose a multi-model approach, i.e. DeepBlurMM, to alleviate the impact of unsharp image areas and improve the model performance. DeepBlurMM uses the sigma cut-offs to determine the most suitable model for predicting tiles with various levels of blurring within a single WSI, where sigma is the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution. Specifically, the cut-offs categorise the tiles into sharp or slight blur, moderate blur, and high blur. Each blur level has a corresponding model to be selected for tile-level predictions. Throughout the simulation study, we demonstrated the application of DeepBlurMM in a binary classification task for breast cancer Nottingham Histological Grade 1 vs 3. Performance, evaluated over 5-fold cross-validation, showed that DeepBlurMM outperformed the base model under moderate blur and mixed blur conditions. Unsharp image tiles (local blurriness) at prediction time reduced model performance. The proposed multi-model approach improved performance under some conditions, with the potential to improve quality in both research and clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Large coordinate kernel attention network for lightweight image super-resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multi-scale receptive field and large kernel attention (LKA) module have been shown to significantly improve performance in the lightweight image super-resolution task. However, existing lightweight super-resolution (SR) methods seldom pay attention to designing efficient building block with multi-scale receptive field for local modeling, and their LKA modules face a quadratic increase in computational and memory footprints as the convolutional kernel size increases. To address the first issue, we propose the multi-scale blueprint separable convolutions (MBSConv) as highly efficient building block with multi-scale receptive field, it can focus on the learning for the multi-scale information which is a vital component of discriminative representation. As for the second issue, we revisit the key properties of LKA in which we find that the adjacent direct interaction of local information and long-distance dependencies is crucial to provide remarkable performance. Thus, taking this into account and in order to mitigate the complexity of LKA, we propose a large coordinate kernel attention (LCKA) module which decomposes the 2D convolutional kernels of the depth-wise convolutional layers in LKA into horizontal and vertical 1-D kernels. LCKA enables the adjacent direct interaction of local information and long-distance dependencies not only in the horizontal direction but also in the vertical. Besides, LCKA allows for the direct use of extremely large kernels in the depth-wise convolutional layers to capture more contextual information, which helps to significantly improve the reconstruction performance, and it incurs lower computational complexity and memory footprints. Integrating MBSConv and LCKA, we propose a large coordinate kernel attention network (LCAN).</description>

      <title>Perception- and Fidelity-aware Reduced-Reference Super-Resolution Image Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of image super-resolution (SR) algorithms, how to evaluate the quality of generated SR images has become an urgent task. Although full-reference methods perform well in SR image quality assessment (SR-IQA), their reliance on high-resolution (HR) images limits their practical applicability. Leveraging available reconstruction information as much as possible for SR-IQA, such as low-resolution (LR) images and the scale factors, is a promising way to enhance assessment performance for SR-IQA without HR for reference. In this letter, we attempt to evaluate the perceptual quality and reconstruction fidelity of SR images considering LR images and scale factors. Specifically, we propose a novel dual-branch reduced-reference SR-IQA network, \ie, Perception- and Fidelity-aware SR-IQA (PFIQA). The perception-aware branch evaluates the perceptual quality of SR images by leveraging the merits of global modeling of Vision Transformer (ViT) and local relation of ResNet, and incorporating the scale factor to enable comprehensive visual perception. Meanwhile, the fidelity-aware branch assesses the reconstruction fidelity between LR and SR images through their visual perception. The combination of the two branches substantially aligns with the human visual system, enabling a comprehensive SR image evaluation. Experimental results indicate that our PFIQA outperforms current state-of-the-art models across three widely-used SR-IQA benchmarks. Notably, PFIQA excels in assessing the quality of real-world SR images.</description>

      <title>A community palm model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Palm oil production has been identified as one of the major drivers of deforestation for tropical countries. To meet supply chain objectives, commodity producers and other stakeholders need timely information of land cover dynamics in their supply shed. However, such data are difficult to obtain from suppliers who may lack digital geographic representations of their supply sheds and production locations. Here we present a "community model," a machine learning model trained on pooled data sourced from many different stakeholders, to develop a specific land cover probability map, in this case a semi-global oil palm map. An advantage of this method is the inclusion of varied inputs, the ability to easily update the model as new training data becomes available and run the model on any year that input imagery is available. Inclusion of diverse data sources into one probability map can help establish a shared understanding across stakeholders on the presence and absence of a land cover or commodity (in this case oil palm). The model predictors are annual composites built from publicly available satellite imagery provided by Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and ALOS DSM. We provide map outputs as the probability of palm in a given pixel, to reflect the uncertainty of the underlying state (palm or not palm). The initial version of this model provides global accuracy estimated to be approximately 90% (at 0.5 probability threshold) from spatially partitioned test data. This model, and resulting oil palm probability map products are useful for accurately identifying the geographic footprint of palm cultivation. Used in conjunction with timely deforestation information, this palm model is useful for understanding the risk of continued oil palm plantation expansion in sensitive forest areas.</description>

Abstract: Esophageal cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide and ranks sixth in cancer-related mortality. Accurate computer-assisted diagnosis of cancer progression can help physicians effectively customize personalized treatment plans. Currently, CT-based cancer diagnosis methods have received much attention for their comprehensive ability to examine patients' conditions. However, multi-modal based methods may likely introduce information redundancy, leading to underperformance. In addition, efficient and effective interactions between multi-modal representations need to be further explored, lacking insightful exploration of prognostic correlation in multi-modality features. In this work, we introduce a multi-modal heterogeneous graph-based conditional feature-guided diffusion model for lymph node metastasis diagnosis based on CT images as well as clinical measurements and radiomics data. To explore the intricate relationships between multi-modal features, we construct a heterogeneous graph. Following this, a conditional feature-guided diffusion approach is applied to eliminate information redundancy. Moreover, we propose a masked relational representation learning strategy, aiming to uncover the latent prognostic correlations and priorities of primary tumor and lymph node image representations. Various experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/wuchengyu123/MMFusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional studies emphasize the significance of context information in improving matting performance. Consequently, deep learning-based matting methods delve into designing pooling or affinity-based context aggregation modules to achieve superior results. However, these modules cannot well handle the context scale shift caused by the difference in image size during training and inference, resulting in matting performance degradation. In this paper, we revisit the context aggregation mechanisms of matting networks and find that a basic encoder-decoder network without any context aggregation modules can actually learn more universal context aggregation, thereby achieving higher matting performance compared to existing methods. Building on this insight, we present AEMatter, a matting network that is straightforward yet very effective. AEMatter adopts a Hybrid-Transformer backbone with appearance-enhanced axis-wise learning (AEAL) blocks to build a basic network with strong context aggregation learning capability. Furthermore, AEMatter leverages a large image training strategy to assist the network in learning context aggregation from data. Extensive experiments on five popular matting datasets demonstrate that the proposed AEMatter outperforms state-of-the-art matting methods by a large margin.</description>

      <title>Cross-view Action Recognition Understanding From Exocentric to Egocentric Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding action recognition in egocentric videos has emerged as a vital research topic with numerous practical applications. With the limitation in the scale of egocentric data collection, learning robust deep learning-based action recognition models remains difficult. Transferring knowledge learned from the large-scale exocentric data to the egocentric data is challenging due to the difference in videos across views. Our work introduces a novel cross-view learning approach to action recognition (CVAR) that effectively transfers knowledge from the exocentric to the selfish view. First, we present a novel geometric-based constraint into the self-attention mechanism in Transformer based on analyzing the camera positions between two views. Then, we propose a new cross-view self-attention loss learned on unpaired cross-view data to enforce the self-attention mechanism learning to transfer knowledge across views. Finally, to further improve the performance of our cross-view learning approach, we present the metrics to measure the correlations in videos and attention maps effectively. Experimental results on standard egocentric action recognition benchmarks, i.e., Charades-Ego, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and EPIC-Kitchens-100, have shown our approach's effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Role of Language Priors in Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01879v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are impactful in part because they can be applied to a variety of visual understanding tasks in a zero-shot fashion, without any fine-tuning. We study $\textit{generative VLMs}$ that are trained for next-word generation given an image. We explore their zero-shot performance on the illustrative task of image-text retrieval across 8 popular vision-language benchmarks. Our first observation is that they can be repurposed for discriminative tasks (such as image-text retrieval) by simply computing the match score of generating a particular text string given an image. We call this probabilistic score the $\textit{Visual Generative Pre-Training Score}$ (VisualGPTScore). While the VisualGPTScore produces near-perfect accuracy on some retrieval benchmarks, it yields poor accuracy on others. We analyze this behavior through a probabilistic lens, pointing out that some benchmarks inadvertently capture unnatural language distributions by creating adversarial but unlikely text captions. In fact, we demonstrate that even a "blind" language model that ignores any image evidence can sometimes outperform all prior art, reminiscent of similar challenges faced by the visual-question answering (VQA) community many years ago. We derive a probabilistic post-processing scheme that controls for the amount of linguistic bias in generative VLMs at test time without having to retrain or fine-tune the model. We show that the VisualGPTScore, when appropriately debiased, is a strong zero-shot baseline for vision-language understanding, oftentimes producing state-of-the-art accuracy.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a new challenge for image similarity search in the context of fashion, addressing the inherent ambiguity in this domain stemming from complex images. We present Referred Visual Search (RVS), a task allowing users to define more precisely the desired similarity, following recent interest in the industry. We release a new large public dataset, LRVS-Fashion, consisting of 272k fashion products with 842k images extracted from fashion catalogs, designed explicitly for this task. However, unlike traditional visual search methods in the industry, we demonstrate that superior performance can be achieved by bypassing explicit object detection and adopting weakly-supervised conditional contrastive learning on image tuples.

      <title>As large as it gets: Learning infinitely large Filters via Neural Implicit Functions in the Fourier Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work in neural networks for image classification has seen a strong tendency towards increasing the spatial context. Whether achieved through large convolution kernels or self-attention, models scale poorly with the increased spatial context, such that the improved model accuracy often comes at significant costs. In this paper, we propose a module for studying the effective filter size of convolutional neural networks. To facilitate such a study, several challenges need to be addressed: 1) we need an effective means to train models with large filters (potentially as large as the input data) without increasing the number of learnable parameters 2) the employed convolution operation should be a plug-and-play module that can replace conventional convolutions in a CNN and allow for an efficient implementation in current frameworks 3) the study of filter sizes has to be decoupled from other aspects such as the network width or the number of learnable parameters 4) the cost of the convolution operation itself has to remain manageable i.e. we cannot naively increase the size of the convolution kernel. To address these challenges, we propose to learn the frequency representations of filter weights as neural implicit functions, such that the better scalability of the convolution in the frequency domain can be leveraged. Additionally, due to the implementation of the proposed neural implicit function, even large and expressive spatial filters can be parameterized by only a few learnable weights. Our analysis shows that, although the proposed networks could learn very large convolution kernels, the learned filters are well localized and relatively small in practice when transformed from the frequency to the spatial domain. We anticipate that our analysis of individually optimized filter sizes will allow for more efficient, yet effective, models in the future. https://github.com/GeJulia/NIFF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07906v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an approach to modeling an image-space prior on scene motion. Our prior is learned from a collection of motion trajectories extracted from real video sequences depicting natural, oscillatory dynamics such as trees, flowers, candles, and clothes swaying in the wind. We model this dense, long-term motion prior in the Fourier domain:given a single image, our trained model uses a frequency-coordinated diffusion sampling process to predict a spectral volume, which can be converted into a motion texture that spans an entire video. Along with an image-based rendering module, these trajectories can be used for a number of downstream applications, such as turning still images into seamlessly looping videos, or allowing users to realistically interact with objects in real pictures by interpreting the spectral volumes as image-space modal bases, which approximate object dynamics.</description>

      <title>Detail Reinforcement Diffusion Model: Augmentation Fine-Grained Visual Categorization in Few-Shot Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The challenge in fine-grained visual categorization lies in how to explore the subtle differences between different subclasses and achieve accurate discrimination. Previous research has relied on large-scale annotated data and pre-trained deep models to achieve the objective. However, when only a limited amount of samples is available, similar methods may become less effective. Diffusion models have been widely adopted in data augmentation due to their outstanding diversity in data generation. However, the high level of detail required for fine-grained images makes it challenging for existing methods to be directly employed. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach termed the detail reinforcement diffusion model~(DRDM), which leverages the rich knowledge of large models for fine-grained data augmentation and comprises two key components including discriminative semantic recombination (DSR) and spatial knowledge reference~(SKR). Specifically, DSR is designed to extract implicit similarity relationships from the labels and reconstruct the semantic mapping between labels and instances, which enables better discrimination of subtle differences between different subclasses. Furthermore, we introduce the SKR module, which incorporates the distributions of different datasets as references in the feature space. This allows the SKR to aggregate the high-dimensional distribution of subclass features in few-shot FGVC tasks, thus expanding the decision boundary. Through these two critical components, we effectively utilize the knowledge from large models to address the issue of data scarcity, resulting in improved performance for fine-grained visual recognition tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent performance gain offered by our DRDM.</description>

      <title>CoFiI2P: Coarse-to-Fine Correspondences for Image-to-Point Cloud Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image-to-point cloud (I2P) registration is a fundamental task for robots and autonomous vehicles to achieve cross-modality data fusion and localization. Existing I2P registration methods estimate correspondences at the point/pixel level, often overlooking global alignment. However, I2P matching can easily converge to a local optimum when performed without high-level guidance from global constraints. To address this issue, this paper introduces CoFiI2P, a novel I2P registration network that extracts correspondences in a coarse-to-fine manner to achieve the globally optimal solution. First, the image and point cloud data are processed through a Siamese encoder-decoder network for hierarchical feature extraction. Second, a coarse-to-fine matching module is designed to leverage these features and establish robust feature correspondences. Specifically, In the coarse matching phase, a novel I2P transformer module is employed to capture both homogeneous and heterogeneous global information from the image and point cloud data. This enables the estimation of coarse super-point/super-pixel matching pairs with discriminative descriptors. In the fine matching module, point/pixel pairs are established with the guidance of super-point/super-pixel correspondences. Finally, based on matching pairs, the transform matrix is estimated with the EPnP-RANSAC algorithm. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that CoFiI2P achieves impressive results, with a relative rotation error (RRE) of 1.14 degrees and a relative translation error (RTE) of 0.29 meters. These results represent a significant improvement of 84% in RRE and 89% in RTE compared to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method.

      <title>nnSAM: Plug-and-play Segment Anything Model Improves nnUNet Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic segmentation of medical images is crucial in modern clinical workflows. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has emerged as a versatile tool for image segmentation without specific domain training, but it requires human prompts and may have limitations in specific domains. Traditional models like nnUNet perform automatic segmentation during inference and are effective in specific domains but need extensive domain-specific training. To combine the strengths of foundational and domain-specific models, we propose nnSAM, integrating SAM's robust feature extraction with nnUNet's automatic configuration to enhance segmentation accuracy on small datasets. Our nnSAM model optimizes two main approaches: leveraging SAM's feature extraction and nnUNet's domain-specific adaptation, and incorporating a boundary shape supervision loss function based on level set functions and curvature calculations to learn anatomical shape priors from limited data. We evaluated nnSAM on four segmentation tasks: brain white matter, liver, lung, and heart segmentation. Our method outperformed others, achieving the highest DICE score of 82.77% and the lowest ASD of 1.14 mm in brain white matter segmentation with 20 training samples, compared to nnUNet's DICE score of 79.25% and ASD of 1.36 mm. A sample size study highlighted nnSAM's advantage with fewer training samples. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance with nnSAM, showcasing its potential for small-sample learning in medical image segmentation.</description>

      <title>CtxMIM: Context-Enhanced Masked Image Modeling for Remote Sensing Image Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning representations through self-supervision on unlabeled data has proven highly effective for understanding diverse images. However, remote sensing images often have complex and densely populated scenes with multiple land objects and no clear foreground objects. This intrinsic property generates high object density, resulting in false positive pairs or missing contextual information in self-supervised learning. To address these problems, we propose a context-enhanced masked image modeling method (CtxMIM), a simple yet efficient MIM-based self-supervised learning for remote sensing image understanding. CtxMIM formulates original image patches as a reconstructive template and employs a Siamese framework to operate on two sets of image patches. A context-enhanced generative branch is introduced to provide contextual information through context consistency constraints in the reconstruction. With the simple and elegant design, CtxMIM encourages the pre-training model to learn object-level or pixel-level features on a large-scale dataset without specific temporal or geographical constraints. Finally, extensive experiments show that features learned by CtxMIM outperform fully supervised and state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods on various downstream tasks, including land cover classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. These results demonstrate that CtxMIM learns impressive remote sensing representations with high generalization and transferability. Code and data will be made public available.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Side-Tuning for Vision Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05393v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) has showcased significant promise in enhancing visual recognition tasks. Yet, the demand for individualized and comprehensive fine-tuning processes for each task entails substantial computational and memory costs, posing a considerable challenge. Recent advancements in Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) have shown potential for achieving high performance with fewer parameter updates compared to full fine-tuning. However, their effectiveness is primarily observed in simple tasks like image classification, while they encounter challenges with more complex vision tasks like dense prediction. To address this gap, this study aims to identify an effective tuning method that caters to a wider range of visual tasks. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical Side-Tuning (HST), an innovative PETL method facilitating the transfer of ViT models to diverse downstream tasks. Diverging from existing methods that focus solely on fine-tuning parameters within specific input spaces or modules, HST employs a lightweight Hierarchical Side Network (HSN). This network leverages intermediate activations from the ViT backbone to model multi-scale features, enhancing prediction capabilities. To evaluate HST, we conducted comprehensive experiments across a range of visual tasks, including classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Remarkably, HST achieved state-of-the-art performance in 13 out of the 19 tasks on the VTAB-1K benchmark, with the highest average Top-1 accuracy of 76.1%, while fine-tuning a mere 0.78M parameters. When applied to object detection and semantic segmentation tasks on the COCO and ADE20K testdev benchmarks, HST outperformed existing PETL methods and even surpassed full fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Density-Guided Dense Pseudo Label Selection For Semi-supervised Oriented Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, dense pseudo-label, which directly selects pseudo labels from the original output of the teacher model without any complicated post-processing steps, has received considerable attention in semi-supervised object detection (SSOD). However, for the multi-oriented and dense objects that are common in aerial scenes, existing dense pseudo-label selection methods are inefficient because they ignore the significant density difference. Therefore, we propose Density-Guided Dense Pseudo Label Selection (DDPLS) for semi-supervised oriented object detection. In DDPLS, we design a simple but effective adaptive mechanism to guide the selection of dense pseudo labels. Specifically, we propose the Pseudo Density Score (PDS) to estimate the density of potential objects and use this score to select reliable dense pseudo labels. On the DOTA-v1.5 benchmark, the proposed method outperforms previous methods especially when labeled data are scarce. For example, it achieves 49.78 mAP given only 5\% of annotated data, which surpasses previous state-of-the-art method given 10\% of annotated data by 1.15 mAP. Our codes is available at https://github.com/Haru-zt/DDPLS.</description>

      <title>BioCLIP: A Vision Foundation Model for the Tree of Life</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Images of the natural world, collected by a variety of cameras, from drones to individual phones, are increasingly abundant sources of biological information. There is an explosion of computational methods and tools, particularly computer vision, for extracting biologically relevant information from images for science and conservation. Yet most of these are bespoke approaches designed for a specific task and are not easily adaptable or extendable to new questions, contexts, and datasets. A vision model for general organismal biology questions on images is of timely need. To approach this, we curate and release TreeOfLife-10M, the largest and most diverse ML-ready dataset of biology images. We then develop BioCLIP, a foundation model for the tree of life, leveraging the unique properties of biology captured by TreeOfLife-10M, namely the abundance and variety of images of plants, animals, and fungi, together with the availability of rich structured biological knowledge. We rigorously benchmark our approach on diverse fine-grained biology classification tasks and find that BioCLIP consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines (by 16% to 17% absolute). Intrinsic evaluation reveals that BioCLIP has learned a hierarchical representation conforming to the tree of life, shedding light on its strong generalizability. https://imageomics.github.io/bioclip has models, data and code.</description>

      <title>Polarimetric Light Transport Analysis for Specular Inter-reflection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarization is well known for its ability to decompose diffuse and specular reflections. However, the existing decomposition methods only focus on direct reflection and overlook multiple reflections, especially specular inter-reflection. In this paper, we propose a novel decomposition method for handling specular inter-reflection of metal objects by using a unique polarimetric feature: the rotation direction of linear polarization. This rotation direction serves as a discriminative factor between direct and inter-reflection on specular surfaces. To decompose the reflectance components, we actively rotate the linear polarization of incident light and analyze the rotation direction of the reflected light. We evaluate our method using both synthetic and real data, demonstrating its effectiveness in decomposing specular inter-reflections of metal objects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method can be combined with other decomposition methods for a detailed analysis of light transport. As a practical application, we show its effectiveness in improving the accuracy of 3D measurement against strong specular inter-reflection.</description>

      <title>Shapley Values-enabled Progressive Pseudo Bag Augmentation for Whole Slide Image Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In computational pathology, whole slide image (WSI) classification presents a formidable challenge due to its gigapixel resolution and limited fine-grained annotations. Multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a weakly supervised solution, yet refining instance-level information from bag-level labels remains complex. While most of the conventional MIL methods use attention scores to estimate instance importance scores (IIS) which contribute to the prediction of the slide labels, these often lead to skewed attention distributions and inaccuracies in identifying crucial instances. To address these issues, we propose a new approach inspired by cooperative game theory: employing Shapley values to assess each instance's contribution, thereby improving IIS estimation. The computation of the Shapley value is then accelerated using attention, meanwhile retaining the enhanced instance identification and prioritization. We further introduce a framework for the progressive assignment of pseudo bags based on estimated IIS, encouraging more balanced attention distributions in MIL models. Our extensive experiments on CAMELYON-16, BRACS, and TCGA-LUNG datasets show our method's superiority over existing state-of-the-art approaches, offering enhanced interpretability and class-wise insights. We will release the code upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>SqueezeSAM: User friendly mobile interactive segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has been a cornerstone in the field of interactive segmentation, propelling significant progress in generative AI, computational photography, and medical imaging. Despite its ability to process arbitrary user input and generate corresponding segmentation masks, SAM's 600 million parameter architecture, based on ViT-H, is not compatible with current mobile hardware due to its high computational demands and large model size. Our research aims to adapt SAM for use in mobile photography applications. To this end, we have developed a fully convolutional SqueezeSAM model architecture, which is 62.5 times faster and 31.6 times smaller than the original SAM, making it a viable solution for mobile applications. Furthermore, our tiny model achieves an mIOU within \emph{1\%} of the original VIT-H architecture.
  Automated segmentation holds significant value in the creation flow for photography applications, as evidenced by its adoption by leading industry players like apple and capcut. To facilitate this automation, we employ salient object detection and simulate potential user clicks for foreground object selection, generating an initial segmentation mask that users can subsequently edit interactively. A common user expectation is that a click on a specific part of an object will result in the segmentation of the entire object. For example, a click on a person's t-shirt in a photo should ideally segment the entire person, not just the t-shirt. However, SAM typically only segments the clicked area. We address this limitation through a novel data augmentation scheme. Consequently, if a user clicks on a person holding a basketball, both the person and the basketball are segmented together, aligning with user expectations and enhancing the overall user experience.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While head-mounted devices are becoming more compact, they provide egocentric views with significant self-occlusions of the device user. Hence, existing methods often fail to accurately estimate complex 3D poses from egocentric views. In this work, we propose a new transformer-based framework to improve egocentric stereo 3D human pose estimation, which leverages the scene information and temporal context of egocentric stereo videos. Specifically, we utilize 1) depth features from our 3D scene reconstruction module with uniformly sampled windows of egocentric stereo frames, and 2) human joint queries enhanced by temporal features of the video inputs. Our method is able to accurately estimate human poses even in challenging scenarios, such as crouching and sitting. Furthermore, we introduce two new benchmark datasets, i.e., UnrealEgo2 and UnrealEgo-RW (RealWorld). The proposed datasets offer a much larger number of egocentric stereo views with a wider variety of human motions than the existing datasets, allowing comprehensive evaluation of existing and upcoming methods. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms previous methods. We will release UnrealEgo2, UnrealEgo-RW, and trained models on our project page.</description>

      <title>Towards Truly Zero-shot Compositional Visual Reasoning with LLMs as Programmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual reasoning is dominated by end-to-end neural networks scaled to billions of model parameters and training examples. However, even the largest models struggle with compositional reasoning, generalization, fine-grained spatial and temporal reasoning, and counting. Visual reasoning with large language models (LLMs) as controllers can, in principle, address these limitations by decomposing the task and solving subtasks by orchestrating a set of (visual) tools. Recently, these models achieved great performance on tasks such as compositional visual question answering, visual grounding, and video temporal reasoning. Nevertheless, in their current form, these models heavily rely on human engineering of in-context examples in the prompt, which are often dataset- and task-specific and require significant labor by highly skilled programmers. In this work, we present a framework that mitigates these issues by introducing spatially and temporally abstract routines and by leveraging a small number of labeled examples to automatically generate in-context examples, thereby avoiding human-created in-context examples. On a number of visual reasoning tasks, we show that our framework leads to consistent gains in performance, makes LLMs as controllers setup more robust, and removes the need for human engineering of in-context examples.</description>

      <title>Transforming gradient-based techniques into interpretable methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The explication of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) through xAI techniques often poses challenges in interpretation. The inherent complexity of input features, notably pixels extracted from images, engenders complex correlations. Gradient-based methodologies, exemplified by Integrated Gradients (IG), effectively demonstrate the significance of these features. Nevertheless, the conversion of these explanations into images frequently yields considerable noise. Presently, we introduce GAD (Gradient Artificial Distancing) as a supportive framework for gradient-based techniques. Its primary objective is to accentuate influential regions by establishing distinctions between classes. The essence of GAD is to limit the scope of analysis during visualization and, consequently reduce image noise. Empirical investigations involving occluded images have demonstrated that the identified regions through this methodology indeed play a pivotal role in facilitating class differentiation.</description>

      <title>ThemeStation: Generating Theme-Aware 3D Assets from Few Exemplars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world applications often require a large gallery of 3D assets that share a consistent theme. While remarkable advances have been made in general 3D content creation from text or image, synthesizing customized 3D assets following the shared theme of input 3D exemplars remains an open and challenging problem. In this work, we present ThemeStation, a novel approach for theme-aware 3D-to-3D generation. ThemeStation synthesizes customized 3D assets based on given few exemplars with two goals: 1) unity for generating 3D assets that thematically align with the given exemplars and 2) diversity for generating 3D assets with a high degree of variations. To this end, we design a two-stage framework that draws a concept image first, followed by a reference-informed 3D modeling stage. We propose a novel dual score distillation (DSD) loss to jointly leverage priors from both the input exemplars and the synthesized concept image. Extensive experiments and user studies confirm that ThemeStation surpasses prior works in producing diverse theme-aware 3D models with impressive quality. ThemeStation also enables various applications such as controllable 3D-to-3D generation.</description>

      <title>Linear Anchored Gaussian Mixture Model for Location and Width Computations of Objects in Thick Line Shape</title>

Abstract: Accurate detection of the centerline of a thick linear structure and good estimation of its thickness are challenging topics in many real-world applications such X-ray imaging, remote sensing and lane marking detection in road traffic. Model-based approaches using Hough and Radon transforms are often used but, are not recommended for thick line detection, whereas methods based on image derivatives need further step-by-step processing making their efficiency dependent on each step outcome. In this paper, a novel paradigm to better detect thick linear objects is presented, where the 3D image gray level representation is considered as a finite mixture model of a statistical distribution, called linear anchored Gaussian distribution and parametrized by a scale factor to describe the structure thickness and radius and angle parameters to localize the structure centerline. Expectation-Maximization algorithm (Algo1) using the original image as input data is used to estimate the model parameters. To rid the data of irrelevant information brought by nonuniform and noisy background, a modified EM algorithm (Algo2) is detailed. In Experiments, the proposed algorithms show promising results on real-world images and synthetic images corrupted by blur and noise, where Algo2, using Hessian-based angle initialization, outperforms Algo1 and Algo2 with random angle initialization, in terms of running time and structure location and thickness computation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Importance of realism in procedurally-generated synthetic images for deep learning: case studies in maize and canola</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks are often used to identify features of crop plants. However, training their models requires many annotated images, which can be expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Procedural models of plants, such as those developed with Lindenmayer-systems (L-systems) can be created to produce visually realistic simulations, and hence images of plant simulations, where annotations are implicitly known. These synthetic images can either augment or completely replace real images in training neural networks for phenotyping tasks. In this paper, we systematically vary amounts of real and synthetic images used for training in both maize and canola to better understand situations where synthetic images generated from L-systems can help prediction on real images. This work also explores the degree to which realism in the synthetic images improves prediction. We have five different variants of a procedural canola model (these variants were created by tuning the realism while using calibration), and the deep learning results showed how drastically these results improve as the canola synthetic images are made to be more realistic. Furthermore, we see how neural network predictions can be used to help calibrate L-systems themselves, creating a feedback loop.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CNNs, most notably the UNet, are the default architecture for biomedical segmentation. Transformer-based approaches, such as UNETR, have been proposed to replace them, benefiting from a global field of view, but suffering from larger runtimes and higher parameter counts. The recent Vision Mamba architecture offers a compelling alternative to transformers, also providing a global field of view, but at higher efficiency. Here, we introduce ViM-UNet, a novel segmentation architecture based on it and compare it to UNet and UNETR for two challenging microscopy instance segmentation tasks. We find that it performs similarly or better than UNet, depending on the task, and outperforms UNETR while being more efficient. Our code is open source and documented at https://github.com/constantinpape/torch-em/blob/main/vimunet.md.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a self-supervised pretraining method, called OcFeat, for camera-only Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) segmentation networks. With OccFeat, we pretrain a BEV network via occupancy prediction and feature distillation tasks. Occupancy prediction provides a 3D geometric understanding of the scene to the model. However, the geometry learned is class-agnostic. Hence, we add semantic information to the model in the 3D space through distillation from a self-supervised pretrained image foundation model. Models pretrained with our method exhibit improved BEV semantic segmentation performance, particularly in low-data scenarios. Moreover, empirical results affirm the efficacy of integrating feature distillation with 3D occupancy prediction in our pretraining approach.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce UPose3D, a novel approach for multi-view 3D human pose estimation, addressing challenges in accuracy and scalability. Our method advances existing pose estimation frameworks by improving robustness and flexibility without requiring direct 3D annotations. At the core of our method, a pose compiler module refines predictions from a 2D keypoints estimator that operates on a single image by leveraging temporal and cross-view information. Our novel cross-view fusion strategy is scalable to any number of cameras, while our synthetic data generation strategy ensures generalization across diverse actors, scenes, and viewpoints. Finally, UPose3D leverages the prediction uncertainty of both the 2D keypoint estimator and the pose compiler module. This provides robustness to outliers and noisy data, resulting in state-of-the-art performance in out-of-distribution settings. In addition, for in-distribution settings, UPose3D yields a performance rivaling methods that rely on 3D annotated data, while being the state-of-the-art among methods relying only on 2D supervision.</description>

      <title>RaffeSDG: Random Frequency Filtering enabled Single-source Domain Generalization for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning models often encounter challenges in making accurate inferences when there are domain shifts between the source and target data. This issue is particularly pronounced in clinical settings due to the scarcity of annotated data resulting from the professional and private nature of medical data. Despite the existence of decent solutions, many of them are hindered in clinical settings due to limitations in data collection and computational complexity. To tackle domain shifts in data-scarce medical scenarios, we propose a Random frequency filtering enabled Single-source Domain Generalization algorithm (RaffeSDG), which promises robust out-of-domain inference with segmentation models trained on a single-source domain. A filter-based data augmentation strategy is first proposed to promote domain variability within a single-source domain by introducing variations in frequency space and blending homologous samples. Then Gaussian filter-based structural saliency is also leveraged to learn robust representations across augmented samples, further facilitating the training of generalizable segmentation models. To validate the effectiveness of RaffeSDG, we conducted extensive experiments involving out-of-domain inference on segmentation tasks for three human tissues imaged by four diverse modalities. Through thorough investigations and comparisons, compelling evidence was observed in these experiments, demonstrating the potential and generalizability of RaffeSDG. The code is available at https://github.com/liamheng/Non-IID_Medical_Image_Segmentation.</description>

      <title>Lumina-T2X: Transforming Text into Any Modality, Resolution, and Duration via Flow-based Large Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sora unveils the potential of scaling Diffusion Transformer for generating photorealistic images and videos at arbitrary resolutions, aspect ratios, and durations, yet it still lacks sufficient implementation details. In this technical report, we introduce the Lumina-T2X family - a series of Flow-based Large Diffusion Transformers (Flag-DiT) equipped with zero-initialized attention, as a unified framework designed to transform noise into images, videos, multi-view 3D objects, and audio clips conditioned on text instructions. By tokenizing the latent spatial-temporal space and incorporating learnable placeholders such as [nextline] and [nextframe] tokens, Lumina-T2X seamlessly unifies the representations of different modalities across various spatial-temporal resolutions. This unified approach enables training within a single framework for different modalities and allows for flexible generation of multimodal data at any resolution, aspect ratio, and length during inference. Advanced techniques like RoPE, RMSNorm, and flow matching enhance the stability, flexibility, and scalability of Flag-DiT, enabling models of Lumina-T2X to scale up to 7 billion parameters and extend the context window to 128K tokens. This is particularly beneficial for creating ultra-high-definition images with our Lumina-T2I model and long 720p videos with our Lumina-T2V model. Remarkably, Lumina-T2I, powered by a 5-billion-parameter Flag-DiT, requires only 35% of the training computational costs of a 600-million-parameter naive DiT. Our further comprehensive analysis underscores Lumina-T2X's preliminary capability in resolution extrapolation, high-resolution editing, generating consistent 3D views, and synthesizing videos with seamless transitions. We expect that the open-sourcing of Lumina-T2X will further foster creativity, transparency, and diversity in the generative AI community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Berry picking has long-standing traditions in Finland, yet it is challenging and can potentially be dangerous. The integration of drones equipped with advanced imaging techniques represents a transformative leap forward, optimising harvests and promising sustainable practices. We propose WildBe, the first image dataset of wild berries captured in peatlands and under the canopy of Finnish forests using drones. Unlike previous and related datasets, WildBe includes new varieties of berries, such as bilberries, cloudberries, lingonberries, and crowberries, captured under severe light variations and in cluttered environments. WildBe features 3,516 images, including a total of 18,468 annotated bounding boxes. We carry out a comprehensive analysis of WildBe using six popular object detectors, assessing their effectiveness in berry detection across different forest regions and camera types. We will release WildBe publicly.</description>

      <title>Vector-Symbolic Architecture for Event-Based Optical Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From a perspective of feature matching, optical flow estimation for event cameras involves identifying event correspondences by comparing feature similarity across accompanying event frames. In this work, we introduces an effective and robust high-dimensional (HD) feature descriptor for event frames, utilizing Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA). The topological similarity among neighboring variables within VSA contributes to the enhanced representation similarity of feature descriptors for flow-matching points, while its structured symbolic representation capacity facilitates feature fusion from both event polarities and multiple spatial scales. Based on this HD feature descriptor, we propose a novel feature matching framework for event-based optical flow, encompassing both model-based (VSA-Flow) and self-supervised learning (VSA-SM) methods. In VSA-Flow, accurate optical flow estimation validates the effectiveness of HD feature descriptors. In VSA-SM, a novel similarity maximization method based on the HD feature descriptor is proposed to learn optical flow in a self-supervised way from events alone, eliminating the need for auxiliary grayscale images. Evaluation results demonstrate that our VSA-based method achieves superior accuracy in comparison to both model-based and self-supervised learning methods on the DSEC benchmark, while remains competitive among both methods on the MVSEC benchmark. This contribution marks a significant advancement in event-based optical flow within the feature matching methodology.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Adversarial Attacks on Autonomous Driving Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an attacking mechanism to challenge the resilience of autonomous driving systems. Specifically, we manipulate the decision-making processes of an autonomous vehicle by dynamically displaying adversarial patches on a screen mounted on another moving vehicle. These patches are optimized to deceive the object detection models into misclassifying targeted objects, e.g., traffic signs. Such manipulation has significant implications for critical multi-vehicle interactions such as intersection crossing and lane changing, which are vital for safe and efficient autonomous driving systems. Particularly, we make four major contributions. First, we introduce a novel adversarial attack approach where the patch is not co-located with its target, enabling more versatile and stealthy attacks. Moreover, our method utilizes dynamic patches displayed on a screen, allowing for adaptive changes and movement, enhancing the flexibility and performance of the attack. To do so, we design a Screen Image Transformation Network (SIT-Net), which simulates environmental effects on the displayed images, narrowing the gap between simulated and real-world scenarios. Further, we integrate a positional loss term into the adversarial training process to increase the success rate of the dynamic attack. Finally, we shift the focus from merely attacking perceptual systems to influencing the decision-making algorithms of self-driving systems. Our experiments demonstrate the first successful implementation of such dynamic adversarial attacks in real-world autonomous driving scenarios, paving the way for advancements in the field of robust and secure autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>3D Diffusion Policy: Generalizable Visuomotor Policy Learning via Simple 3D Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03954v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning provides an efficient way to teach robots dexterous skills; however, learning complex skills robustly and generalizablely usually consumes large amounts of human demonstrations. To tackle this challenging problem, we present 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3), a novel visual imitation learning approach that incorporates the power of 3D visual representations into diffusion policies, a class of conditional action generative models. The core design of DP3 is the utilization of a compact 3D visual representation, extracted from sparse point clouds with an efficient point encoder. In our experiments involving 72 simulation tasks, DP3 successfully handles most tasks with just 10 demonstrations and surpasses baselines with a 24.2% relative improvement. In 4 real robot tasks, DP3 demonstrates precise control with a high success rate of 85%, given only 40 demonstrations of each task, and shows excellent generalization abilities in diverse aspects, including space, viewpoint, appearance, and instance. Interestingly, in real robot experiments, DP3 rarely violates safety requirements, in contrast to baseline methods which frequently do, necessitating human intervention. Our extensive evaluation highlights the critical importance of 3D representations in real-world robot learning.

      <description>arXiv:2404.00252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Panoramic videos have the advantage of providing an immersive and interactive viewing experience. Nevertheless, their spherical nature gives rise to various and uncertain user viewing behaviors, which poses significant challenges for panoramic video quality assessment (PVQA). In this work, we propose an end-to-end optimized, blind PVQA method with explicit modeling of user viewing patterns through visual scanpaths. Our method consists of two modules: a scanpath generator and a quality assessor. The scanpath generator is initially trained to predict future scanpaths by minimizing their expected code length and then jointly optimized with the quality assessor for quality prediction. Our blind PVQA method enables direct quality assessment of panoramic images by treating them as videos composed of identical frames. Experiments on three public panoramic image and video quality datasets, encompassing both synthetic and authentic distortions, validate the superiority of our blind PVQA model over existing methods.</description>

      <title>MileBench: Benchmarking MLLMs in Long Context</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the advancements and impressive performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on benchmarks, their effectiveness in real-world, long-context, and multi-image tasks is unclear due to the benchmarks' limited scope. Existing benchmarks often focus on single-image and short-text samples, and when assessing multi-image tasks, they either limit the image count or focus on specific task (e.g time-series captioning), potentially obscuring the performance challenges of MLLMs. To address these limitations, we introduce MileBench, a pioneering benchmark designed to test the MultImodal Long-contExt capabilities of MLLMs. This benchmark comprises not only multimodal long contexts, but also multiple tasks requiring both comprehension and generation. We establish two distinct evaluation sets, diagnostic and realistic, to systematically assess MLLMs' long-context adaptation capacity and their ability to complete tasks in long-context scenarios. Our experimental results, obtained from testing 22 models, revealed that while the closed-source GPT-4o outperforms others, most open-source MLLMs struggle in long-context situations. Interestingly, the performance gap tends to widen with an increase in the number of images. We strongly encourage an intensification of research efforts towards enhancing MLLMs' long-context capabilities, especially in scenarios involving multiple images.</description>

      <title>SSUMamba: Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model for Hyperspectral Image Denoising</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01726v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Denoising hyperspectral images (HSIs) is a crucial preprocessing procedure due to the noise originating from intra-imaging mechanisms and environmental factors. Utilizing domain-specific knowledge of HSIs, such as spectral correlation, spatial self-similarity, and spatial-spectral correlation, is essential for deep learning-based denoising. Existing methods are often constrained by running time, space complexity, and computational complexity, employing strategies that explore these priors separately. While these strategies can avoid some redundant information, they inevitably overlook broader and more underlying long-range spatial-spectral information that positively impacts image restoration. This paper proposes a Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model-based U-shaped network, termed Spatial-Spectral U-Mamba (SSUMamba), for hyperspectral image denoising. We can obtain complete global spatial-spectral correlation within a module thanks to the linear space complexity in State Space Model (SSM) computations. We introduce a Spatial-Spectral Alternating Scan (SSAS) strategy for HSIs, which helps model the information flow in multiple directions in 3-D HSIs.

      <title>Similarity Metrics for MR Image-To-Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08431</link>

Abstract: Image-to-image translation can create large impact in medical imaging, i.e. if images of a patient can be translated to another modality, type or sequence for better diagnosis. However, these methods must be validated by human reader studies, which are costly and restricted to small samples. Automatic evaluation of large samples to pre-evaluate and continuously improve methods before human validation is needed. In this study, we give an overview of reference and non-reference metrics for image synthesis assessment and investigate the ability of nine metrics, that need a reference (SSIM, MS-SSIM, PSNR, MSE, NMSE, MAE, LPIPS, NMI and PCC) and three non-reference metrics (BLUR, MSN, MNG) to detect 11 kinds of distortions in MR images from the BraSyn dataset. In addition we test a downstream segmentation metric and the effect of three normalization methods (Minmax, cMinMax and Zscore). Although PSNR and SSIM are frequently used to evaluate generative models for image-to-image-translation tasks in the medical domain, they show very specific shortcomings. SSIM ignores blurring but is very sensitive to intensity shifts in unnormalized MR images. PSNR is even more sensitive to different normalization methods and hardly measures the degree of distortions. Further metrics, such as LPIPS, NMI and DICE can be very useful to evaluate other similarity aspects. If the images to be compared are misaligned, most metrics are flawed. By carefully selecting and reasonably combining image similarity metrics, the training and selection of generative models for MR image synthesis can be improved. Many aspects of their output can be validated before final and costly evaluation by trained radiologists is conducted.</description>

      <title>RMT-BVQA: Recurrent Memory Transformer-based Blind Video Quality Assessment for Enhanced Video Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With recent advances in deep learning, numerous algorithms have been developed to enhance video quality, reduce visual artefacts and improve perceptual quality. However, little research has been reported on the quality assessment of enhanced content - the evaluation of enhancement methods is often based on quality metrics that were designed for compression applications. In this paper, we propose a novel blind deep video quality assessment (VQA) method specifically for enhanced video content. It employs a new Recurrent Memory Transformer (RMT) based network architecture to obtain video quality representations, which is optimised through a novel content-quality-aware contrastive learning strategy based on a new database containing 13K training patches with enhanced content. The extracted quality representations are then combined through linear regression to generate video-level quality indices. The proposed method, RMT-BVQA, has been evaluated on the VDPVE (VQA Dataset for Perceptual Video Enhancement) database through a five-fold cross validation. The results show its superior correlation performance when compared to ten existing no-reference quality metrics.</description>
