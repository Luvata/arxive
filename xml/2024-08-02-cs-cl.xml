      <title>An Application of Large Language Models to Coding Negotiation Transcripts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLM) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in the field of natural language processing (NLP). This paper explores the application of LLMs in negotiation transcript analysis by the Vanderbilt AI Negotiation Lab. Starting in September 2022, we applied multiple strategies using LLMs from zero shot learning to fine tuning models to in-context learning). The final strategy we developed is explained, along with how to access and use the model. This study provides a sense of both the opportunities and roadblocks for the implementation of LLMs in real life applications and offers a model for how LLMs can be applied to coding in other fields.</description>

      <title>Advancing Chart Question Answering with Robust Chart Component Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chart comprehension presents significant challenges for machine learning models due to the diverse and intricate shapes of charts. Existing multimodal methods often overlook these visual features or fail to integrate them effectively for chart question answering (ChartQA). To address this, we introduce Chartformer, a unified framework that enhances chart component recognition by accurately identifying and classifying components such as bars, lines, pies, titles, legends, and axes. Additionally, we propose a novel Question-guided Deformable Co-Attention (QDCAt) mechanism, which fuses chart features encoded by Chartformer with the given question, leveraging the question's guidance to ground the correct answer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approaches significantly outperform baseline models in chart component recognition and ChartQA tasks, achieving improvements of 3.2% in mAP and 15.4% in accuracy, respectively. These results underscore the robustness of our solution for detailed visual data interpretation across various applications.</description>

      <title>Mapping Patient Trajectories: Understanding and Visualizing Sepsis Prognostic Pathways from Patients Clinical Narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, healthcare professionals are increasingly emphasizing on personalized and evidence-based patient care through the exploration of prognostic pathways. To study this, structured clinical variables from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) data have traditionally been employed by many researchers. Presently, Natural Language Processing models have received great attention in clinical research which expanded the possibilities of using clinical narratives. In this paper, we propose a systematic methodology for developing sepsis prognostic pathways derived from clinical notes, focusing on diverse patient subgroups identified by exploring comorbidities associated with sepsis and generating explanations of these subgroups using SHAP. The extracted prognostic pathways of these subgroups provide valuable insights into the dynamic trajectories of sepsis severity over time. Visualizing these pathways sheds light on the likelihood and direction of disease progression across various contexts and reveals patterns and pivotal factors or biomarkers influencing the transition between sepsis stages, whether toward deterioration or improvement. This empowers healthcare providers to implement more personalized and effective healthcare strategies for individual patients.</description>

      <title>They Look Like Each Other: Case-based Reasoning for Explainable Depression Detection on Twitter using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depression is a common mental health issue that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Despite the promise of social media data for depression detection, the opacity of employed deep learning models hinders interpretability and raises bias concerns. We address this challenge by introducing ProtoDep, a novel, explainable framework for Twitter-based depression detection. ProtoDep leverages prototype learning and the generative power of Large Language Models to provide transparent explanations at three levels: (i) symptom-level explanations for each tweet and user, (ii) case-based explanations comparing the user to similar individuals, and (iii) transparent decision-making through classification weights. Evaluated on five benchmark datasets, ProtoDep achieves near state-of-the-art performance while learning meaningful prototypes. This multi-faceted approach offers significant potential to enhance the reliability and transparency of depression detection on social media, ultimately aiding mental health professionals in delivering more informed care.</description>

      <title>CP-Prompt: Composition-Based Cross-modal Prompting for Domain-Incremental Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The key challenge of cross-modal domain-incremental learning (DIL) is to enable the learning model to continuously learn from novel data with different feature distributions under the same task without forgetting old ones. However, existing top-performing methods still cause high forgetting rates, by lacking intra-domain knowledge extraction and inter-domain common prompting strategy. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework, CP-Prompt, by training limited parameters to instruct a pre-trained model to learn new domains and avoid forgetting existing feature distributions. CP-Prompt captures intra-domain knowledge by compositionally inserting personalized prompts on multi-head self-attention layers and then learns the inter-domain knowledge with a common prompting strategy. CP-Prompt shows superiority compared with state-of-the-art baselines among three widely evaluated DIL tasks. The source code is available at https://github.com/dannis97500/CP_Prompt.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Potential: Benchmarking Large Language Models in Water Engineering and Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their potential applications across various fields. This paper embarked on a pivotal inquiry: Can existing LLMs effectively serve as "water expert models" for water engineering and research tasks? This study was the first to evaluate LLMs' contributions across various water engineering and research tasks by establishing a domain-specific benchmark suite, namely, WaterER. Herein, we prepared 983 tasks related to water engineering and research, categorized into "wastewater treatment", "environmental restoration", "drinking water treatment and distribution", "sanitation", "anaerobic digestion" and "contaminants assessment". We evaluated the performance of seven LLMs (i.e., GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Gemini, GLM-4, ERNIE, QWEN and Llama3) on these tasks. We highlighted the strengths of GPT-4 in handling diverse and complex tasks of water engineering and water research, the specialized capabilities of Gemini in academic contexts, Llama3's strongest capacity to answer Chinese water engineering questions and the competitive performance of Chinese-oriented models like GLM-4, ERNIE and QWEN in some water engineering tasks. More specifically, current LLMs excelled particularly in generating precise research gaps for papers on "contaminants and related water quality monitoring and assessment". Additionally, they were more adept at creating appropriate titles for research papers on "treatment processes for wastewaters", "environmental restoration", and "drinking water treatment". Overall, this study pioneered evaluating LLMs in water engineering and research by introducing the WaterER benchmark to assess the trustworthiness of their predictions. This standardized evaluation framework would also drive future advancements in LLM technology by using targeting datasets, propelling these models towards becoming true "water expert".</description>

      <title>Promises and Pitfalls of Generative Masked Language Modeling: Theoretical Framework and Practical Guidelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive language models are the currently dominant paradigm for text generation, but they have some fundamental limitations that cannot be remedied by scale-for example inherently sequential and unidirectional generation. While alternate classes of models have been explored, we have limited mathematical understanding of their fundamental power and limitations. In this paper we focus on Generative Masked Language Models (GMLMs), a non-autoregressive paradigm in which we train a model to fit conditional probabilities of the data distribution via masking, which are subsequently used as inputs to a Markov Chain to draw samples from the model, These models empirically strike a promising speed-quality trade-off as each step can be typically parallelized by decoding the entire sequence in parallel. We develop a mathematical framework for analyzing and improving such models which sheds light on questions of sample complexity and inference speed and quality. Empirically, we adapt the T5 model for iteratively-refined parallel decoding, achieving 2-3x speedup in machine translation with minimal sacrifice in quality compared with autoregressive models. We run careful ablation experiments to give recommendations on key design choices, and make fine-grained observations on the common error modes in connection with our theory. Our mathematical analyses and empirical observations characterize both potentials and limitations of this approach, and can be applied to future works on improving understanding and performance of GMLMs. Our codes are released at https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/padir</description>

      <title>APTNESS: Incorporating Appraisal Theory and Emotion Support Strategies for Empathetic Response Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empathetic response generation is designed to comprehend the emotions of others and select the most appropriate strategies to assist them in resolving emotional challenges. Empathy can be categorized into cognitive empathy and affective empathy. The former pertains to the ability to understand and discern the emotional issues and situations of others, while the latter involves the capacity to provide comfort. To enhance one's empathetic abilities, it is essential to develop both these aspects. Therefore, we develop an innovative framework that combines retrieval augmentation and emotional support strategy integration. Our framework starts with the introduction of a comprehensive emotional palette for empathy. We then apply appraisal theory to decompose this palette and create a database of empathetic responses. This database serves as an external resource and enhances the LLM's empathy by integrating semantic retrieval mechanisms. Moreover, our framework places a strong emphasis on the proper articulation of response strategies. By incorporating emotional support strategies, we aim to enrich the model's capabilities in both cognitive and affective empathy, leading to a more nuanced and comprehensive empathetic response. Finally, we extract datasets ED and ET from the empathetic dialogue dataset \textsc{EmpatheticDialogues} and ExTES based on dialogue length. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can enhance the empathy ability of LLMs from both cognitive and affective empathy perspectives. Our code is released at https://github.com/CAS-SIAT-XinHai/APTNESS.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Long Range Dependency Handling in Code Generation Models using Multi-Step Key Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As language models support larger and larger context sizes, evaluating their ability to make effective use of that context becomes increasingly important. We analyze the ability of several code generation models to handle long range dependencies using a suite of multi-step key retrieval tasks in context windows up to 8k tokens in length. The tasks progressively increase in difficulty and allow more nuanced evaluation of model capabilities than tests like the popular needle-in-the-haystack test. We find that performance degrades significantly (up to 2x) when a function references another function that is defined later in the prompt. We also observe that models that use sliding window attention mechanisms have difficulty handling references further than the size of a single window. We perform simple prompt modifications using call graph information to improve multi-step retrieval performance up to 3x. Our analysis highlights different facets of long-context performance and is suggestive of prompt construction strategies for code completion tools</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence in Extracting Diagnostic Data from Dental Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research addresses the issue of missing structured data in dental records by extracting diagnostic information from unstructured text. The updated periodontology classification system's complexity has increased incomplete or missing structured diagnoses. To tackle this, we use advanced AI and NLP methods, leveraging GPT-4 to generate synthetic notes for fine-tuning a RoBERTa model. This significantly enhances the model's ability to understand medical and dental language. We evaluated the model using 120 randomly selected clinical notes from two datasets, demonstrating its improved diagnostic extraction accuracy. The results showed high accuracy in diagnosing periodontal status, stage, and grade, with Site 1 scoring 0.99 and Site 2 scoring 0.98. In the subtype category, Site 2 achieved perfect scores, outperforming Site 1. This method enhances extraction accuracy and broadens its use across dental contexts. The study underscores AI and NLP's transformative impact on healthcare delivery and management. Integrating AI and NLP technologies enhances documentation and simplifies administrative tasks by precisely extracting complex clinical information. This approach effectively addresses challenges in dental diagnostics. Using synthetic training data from LLMs optimizes the training process, improving accuracy and efficiency in identifying periodontal diagnoses from clinical notes. This innovative method holds promise for broader healthcare applications, potentially improving patient care quality.</description>

      <title>An Active Inference Strategy for Prompting Reliable Responses from Large Language Models in Medical Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuing advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) in artificial intelligence offer important capacities in intuitively accessing and using medical knowledge in many contexts, including education and training as well as assessment and treatment. Most of the initial literature on LLMs in medicine has emphasized that LLMs are unsuitable for medical use because they are non-deterministic, may provide incorrect or harmful responses, and cannot be regulated to assure quality control. If these issues could be corrected, optimizing LLM technology could benefit patients and physicians by providing affordable, point-of-care medical knowledge. Our proposed framework refines LLM responses by restricting their primary knowledge base to domain-specific datasets containing validated medical information. Additionally, we introduce an actor-critic LLM prompting protocol based on active inference principles of human cognition, where a Therapist agent initially responds to patient queries, and a Supervisor agent evaluates and adjusts responses to ensure accuracy and reliability. We conducted a validation study where expert cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) therapists evaluated responses from the LLM in a blind format. Experienced human CBT-I therapists assessed responses to 100 patient queries, comparing LLM-generated responses with appropriate and inappropriate responses crafted by experienced CBT-I therapists. Results showed that LLM responses received high ratings from the CBT-I therapists, often exceeding those of therapist-generated appropriate responses. This structured approach aims to integrate advanced LLM technology into medical applications, meeting regulatory requirements for establishing the safe and effective use of special purpose validated LLMs in medicine.</description>

      <title>Table-Filling via Mean Teacher for Cross-domain Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) aims to extract fine-grained sentiment elements from target domain sentences by leveraging the knowledge acquired from the source domain. Due to the absence of labeled data in the target domain, recent studies tend to rely on pre-trained language models to generate large amounts of synthetic data for training purposes. However, these approaches entail additional computational costs associated with the generation process. Different from them, we discover a striking resemblance between table-filling methods in ASTE and two-stage Object Detection (OD) in computer vision, which inspires us to revisit the cross-domain ASTE task and approach it from an OD standpoint. This allows the model to benefit from the OD extraction paradigm and region-level alignment. Building upon this premise, we propose a novel method named \textbf{T}able-\textbf{F}illing via \textbf{M}ean \textbf{T}eacher (TFMT). Specifically, the table-filling methods encode the sentence into a 2D table to detect word relations, while TFMT treats the table as a feature map and utilizes a region consistency to enhance the quality of those generated pseudo labels. Additionally, considering the existence of the domain gap, a cross-domain consistency based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy is designed to alleviate domain shift problems. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameters and computational costs, making it a strong baseline for cross-domain ASTE.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Models for Cancer Clinical Practice Guidelines : Construction, Management and Usage in Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An automated knowledge modeling algorithm for Cancer Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) extracts the knowledge contained in the CPG documents and transforms it into a programmatically interactable, easy-to-update structured model with minimal human intervention. The existing automated algorithms have minimal scope and cannot handle the varying complexity of the knowledge content in the CPGs for different cancer types. This work proposes an improved automated knowledge modeling algorithm to create knowledge models from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) CPGs in Oncology for different cancer types. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated with NCCN CPGs for four different cancer types. We also proposed an algorithm to compare the knowledge models for different versions of a guideline to discover the specific changes introduced in the treatment protocol of a new version. We created a question-answering (Q&amp;A) framework with the guideline knowledge models as the augmented knowledge base to study our ability to query the knowledge models. We compiled a set of 32 question-answer pairs derived from two reliable data sources for the treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) to evaluate the Q&amp;A framework. The framework was evaluated against the question-answer pairs from one data source, and it can generate the answers with 54.5% accuracy from the treatment algorithm and 81.8% accuracy from the discussion part of the NCCN NSCLC guideline knowledge model.</description>

      <title>Sentiment Reasoning for Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transparency in AI decision-making is crucial in healthcare due to the severe consequences of errors, and this is important for building trust among AI and users in sentiment analysis task. Incorporating reasoning capabilities helps Large Language Models (LLMs) understand human emotions within broader contexts, handle nuanced and ambiguous language, and infer underlying sentiments that may not be explicitly stated. In this work, we introduce a new task - Sentiment Reasoning - for both speech and text modalities, along with our proposed multimodal multitask framework and dataset. Our study showed that rationale-augmented training enhances model performance in sentiment classification across both human transcript and ASR settings. Also, we found that the generated rationales typically exhibit different vocabularies compared to human-generated rationales, but maintain similar semantics. All code, data (English-translated and Vietnamese) and models are published online: https://github.com/leduckhai/MultiMed</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable proficiency in natural language understanding, prompting extensive exploration of their potential applications across diverse domains. In the medical domain, open-source LLMs have demonstrated moderate efficacy following domain-specific fine-tuning; however, they remain substantially inferior to proprietary models such as GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. These open-source models encounter limitations in the comprehensiveness of domain-specific knowledge and exhibit a propensity for 'hallucinations' during text generation. To mitigate these issues, researchers have implemented the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, which augments LLMs with background information from external knowledge bases while preserving the model's internal parameters. However, document noise can adversely affect performance, and the application of RAG in the medical field remains in its nascent stages. This study presents the Bailicai framework: a novel integration of retrieval-augmented generation with large language models optimized for the medical domain. The Bailicai framework augments the performance of LLMs in medicine through the implementation of four sub-modules. Experimental results demonstrate that the Bailicai approach surpasses existing medical domain LLMs across multiple medical benchmarks and exceeds the performance of GPT-3.5. Furthermore, the Bailicai method effectively attenuates the prevalent issue of hallucinations in medical applications of LLMs and ameliorates the noise-related challenges associated with traditional RAG techniques when processing irrelevant or pseudo-relevant documents.</description>

      <title>What Matters in Explanations: Towards Explainable Fake Review Detection Focusing on Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Customers' reviews and feedback play crucial role on electronic commerce~(E-commerce) platforms like Amazon, Zalando, and eBay in influencing other customers' purchasing decisions. However, there is a prevailing concern that sellers often post fake or spam reviews to deceive potential customers and manipulate their opinions about a product. Over the past decade, there has been considerable interest in using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to identify such fraudulent reviews. Unfortunately, the decisions made by complex ML and DL models - which often function as \emph{black-boxes} - can be surprising and difficult for general users to comprehend. In this paper, we propose an explainable framework for detecting fake reviews with high precision in identifying fraudulent content with explanations and investigate what information matters most for explaining particular decisions by conducting empirical user evaluation. Initially, we develop fake review detection models using DL and transformer models including XLNet and DistilBERT. We then introduce layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) technique for generating explanations that can map the contributions of words toward the predicted class. The experimental results on two benchmark fake review detection datasets demonstrate that our predictive models achieve state-of-the-art performance and outperform several existing methods. Furthermore, the empirical user evaluation of the generated explanations concludes which important information needs to be considered in generating explanations in the context of fake review identification.</description>

      <title>Multi-group Uncertainty Quantification for Long-form Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models are rapidly moving towards consumer-facing applications, they are often still prone to factual errors and hallucinations. In order to reduce the potential harms that may come from these errors, it is important for users to know to what extent they can trust an LLM when it makes a factual claim. To this end, we study the problem of uncertainty quantification of factual correctness in long-form natural language generation. Given some output from a large language model, we study both uncertainty at the level of individual claims contained within the output (via calibration) and uncertainty across the entire output itself (via conformal prediction). Moreover, we invoke multicalibration and multivalid conformal prediction to ensure that such uncertainty guarantees are valid both marginally and across distinct groups of prompts. Using the task of biography generation, we demonstrate empirically that having access to and making use of additional group attributes for each prompt improves both overall and group-wise performance. As the problems of calibration, conformal prediction, and their multi-group counterparts have not been extensively explored previously in the context of long-form text generation, we consider these empirical results to form a benchmark for this setting.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Interplay of Scale, Data, and Bias in Language Models: A Case Study with BERT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current landscape of language model research, larger models, larger datasets and more compute seems to be the only way to advance towards intelligence. While there have been extensive studies of scaling laws and models' scaling behaviors, the effect of scale on a model's social biases and stereotyping tendencies has received less attention. In this study, we explore the influence of model scale and pre-training data on its learnt social biases. We focus on BERT -- an extremely popular language model -- and investigate biases as they show up during language modeling (upstream), as well as during classification applications after fine-tuning (downstream). Our experiments on four architecture sizes of BERT demonstrate that pre-training data substantially influences how upstream biases evolve with model scale. With increasing scale, models pre-trained on large internet scrapes like Common Crawl exhibit higher toxicity, whereas models pre-trained on moderated data sources like Wikipedia show greater gender stereotypes. However, downstream biases generally decrease with increasing model scale, irrespective of the pre-training data. Our results highlight the qualitative role of pre-training data in the biased behavior of language models, an often overlooked aspect in the study of scale. Through a detailed case study of BERT, we shed light on the complex interplay of data and model scale, and investigate how it translates to concrete biases.</description>

      <title>Modular RAG: Transforming RAG Systems into LEGO-like Reconfigurable Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has markedly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. The increasing demands of application scenarios have driven the evolution of RAG, leading to the integration of advanced retrievers, LLMs and other complementary technologies, which in turn has amplified the intricacy of RAG systems. However, the rapid advancements are outpacing the foundational RAG paradigm, with many methods struggling to be unified under the process of "retrieve-then-generate". In this context, this paper examines the limitations of the existing RAG paradigm and introduces the modular RAG framework. By decomposing complex RAG systems into independent modules and specialized operators, it facilitates a highly reconfigurable framework. Modular RAG transcends the traditional linear architecture, embracing a more advanced design that integrates routing, scheduling, and fusion mechanisms. Drawing on extensive research, this paper further identifies prevalent RAG patterns-linear, conditional, branching, and looping-and offers a comprehensive analysis of their respective implementation nuances. Modular RAG presents innovative opportunities for the conceptualization and deployment of RAG systems. Finally, the paper explores the potential emergence of new operators and paradigms, establishing a solid theoretical foundation and a practical roadmap for the continued evolution and practical deployment of RAG technologies.</description>

      <title>Using Large Language Models for the Interpretation of Building Regulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compliance checking is an essential part of a construction project. The recent rapid uptake of building information models (BIM) in the construction industry has created more opportunities for automated compliance checking (ACC). BIM enables sharing of digital building design data that can be used for compliance checking with legal requirements, which are conventionally conveyed in natural language and not intended for machine processing. Creating a computable representation of legal requirements suitable for ACC is complex, costly, and time-consuming. Large language models (LLMs) such as the generative pre-trained transformers (GPT), GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, powering OpenAI's ChatGPT, can generate logically coherent text and source code responding to user prompts. This capability could be used to automate the conversion of building regulations into a semantic and computable representation. This paper evaluates the performance of LLMs in translating building regulations into LegalRuleML in a few-shot learning setup. By providing GPT-3.5 with only a few example translations, it can learn the basic structure of the format. Using a system prompt, we further specify the LegalRuleML representation and explore the existence of expert domain knowledge in the model. Such domain knowledge might be ingrained in GPT-3.5 through the broad pre-training but needs to be brought forth by careful contextualisation. Finally, we investigate whether strategies such as chain-of-thought reasoning and self-consistency could apply to this use case. As LLMs become more sophisticated, the increased common sense, logical coherence, and means to domain adaptation can significantly support ACC, leading to more efficient and effective checking processes.</description>

      <title>Improving noisy student training for low-resource languages in End-to-End ASR using CycleGAN and inter-domain losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training a semi-supervised end-to-end speech recognition system using noisy student training has significantly improved performance. However, this approach requires a substantial amount of paired speech-text and unlabeled speech, which is costly for low-resource languages. Therefore, this paper considers a more extreme case of semi-supervised end-to-end automatic speech recognition where there are limited paired speech-text, unlabeled speech (less than five hours), and abundant external text. Firstly, we observe improved performance by training the model using our previous work on semi-supervised learning "CycleGAN and inter-domain losses" solely with external text. Secondly, we enhance "CycleGAN and inter-domain losses" by incorporating automatic hyperparameter tuning, calling it "enhanced CycleGAN inter-domain losses." Thirdly, we integrate it into the noisy student training approach pipeline for low-resource scenarios. Our experimental results, conducted on six non-English languages from Voxforge and Common Voice, show a 20% word error rate reduction compared to the baseline teacher model and a 10% word error rate reduction compared to the baseline best student model, highlighting the significant improvements achieved through our proposed method.</description>

      <title>LawLLM: Law Large Language Model for the US Legal System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of legal analytics, finding relevant cases and accurately predicting judicial outcomes are challenging because of the complexity of legal language, which often includes specialized terminology, complex syntax, and historical context. Moreover, the subtle distinctions between similar and precedent cases require a deep understanding of legal knowledge. Researchers often conflate these concepts, making it difficult to develop specialized techniques to effectively address these nuanced tasks. In this paper, we introduce the Law Large Language Model (LawLLM), a multi-task model specifically designed for the US legal domain to address these challenges. LawLLM excels at Similar Case Retrieval (SCR), Precedent Case Recommendation (PCR), and Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP). By clearly distinguishing between precedent and similar cases, we provide essential clarity, guiding future research in developing specialized strategies for these tasks. We propose customized data preprocessing techniques for each task that transform raw legal data into a trainable format. Furthermore, we also use techniques such as in-context learning (ICL) and advanced information retrieval methods in LawLLM. The evaluation results demonstrate that LawLLM consistently outperforms existing baselines in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, offering unparalleled multi-task capabilities and filling critical gaps in the legal domain.</description>

      <title>ELP-Adapters: Parameter Efficient Adapter Tuning for Various Speech Processing Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a key approach for learning generic representations from speech data. Despite promising results in downstream tasks such as speech recognition, speaker verification, and emotion recognition, a significant number of parameters is required, which makes fine-tuning for each task memory-inefficient. To address this limitation, we introduce ELP-adapter tuning, a novel method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning using three types of adapter, namely encoder adapters (E-adapters), layer adapters (L-adapters), and a prompt adapter (P-adapter). The E-adapters are integrated into transformer-based encoder layers and help to learn fine-grained speech representations that are effective for speech recognition. The L-adapters create paths from each encoder layer to the downstream head and help to extract non-linguistic features from lower encoder layers that are effective for speaker verification and emotion recognition. The P-adapter appends pseudo features to CNN features to further improve effectiveness and efficiency. With these adapters, models can be quickly adapted to various speech processing tasks. Our evaluation across four downstream tasks using five backbone models demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. With the WavLM backbone, its performance was comparable to or better than that of full fine-tuning on all tasks while requiring 90% fewer learnable parameters.</description>

      <title>Exploring Genre and Success Classification through Song Lyrics using DistilBERT: A Fun NLP Venture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a natural language processing (NLP) approach to the problem of thoroughly comprehending song lyrics, with particular attention on genre classification, view-based success prediction, and approximate release year. Our tests provide promising results with 65\% accuracy in genre classification and 79\% accuracy in success prediction, leveraging a DistilBERT model for genre classification and BERT embeddings for release year prediction. Support Vector Machines outperformed other models in predicting the release year, achieving the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) of 14.18. Our study offers insights that have the potential to revolutionize our relationship with music by addressing the shortcomings of current approaches in properly understanding the emotional intricacies of song lyrics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on instruction samples for alignment, but creating these datasets poses challenges, particularly in expert-dependent tasks like coding, which can be cost-prohibitive. One approach to mitigate these challenges is synthesizing data using another LLM. In this paper, we introduce a scalable method for generating synthetic instructions to enhance the code generation capability of LLMs. The proposed algorithm, Genetic-Instruct, mimics evolutionary processes, utilizing self-instruction to create numerous synthetic samples from a limited number of seeds. Genetic-Instruct is designed for efficient scaling of the generation process. Fine-tuning multiple coding LLMs with the synthetic samples demonstrates a significant improvement in their code generation accuracy compared to the baselines.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Large Language Model Inference with Self-Supervised Early Exits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel technique for accelerating inference in large, pre-trained language models (LLMs) by introducing early exits during inference. The computational demands of these models, used across a wide range of applications, can be substantial. By capitalizing on the inherent variability in token complexity, our approach enables selective acceleration of the inference process. Specifically, we propose the integration of early exit ''heads'' atop existing transformer layers, which facilitate conditional terminations based on a confidence metric. These heads are trained in a self-supervised manner using the model's own predictions as training data, thereby eliminating the need for additional annotated data. The confidence metric, established using a calibration set, ensures a desired level of accuracy while enabling early termination when confidence exceeds a predetermined threshold. Notably, our method preserves the original accuracy and reduces computational time on certain tasks, leveraging the existing knowledge of pre-trained LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. This lightweight, modular modification has the potential to greatly enhance the practical usability of LLMs, particularly in applications like real-time language processing in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Entropy, Thermodynamics and the Geometrization of the Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss how pure mathematics and theoretical physics can be applied to the study of language models. Using set theory and analysis, we formulate mathematically rigorous definitions of language models, and introduce the concept of the moduli space of distributions for a language model. We formulate a generalized distributional hypothesis using functional analysis and topology. We define the entropy function associated with a language model and show how it allows us to understand many interesting phenomena in languages. We argue that the zero points of the entropy function and the points where the entropy is close to 0 are the key obstacles for an LLM to approximate an intelligent language model, which explains why good LLMs need billions of parameters. Using the entropy function, we formulate a conjecture about AGI.
  Then, we show how thermodynamics gives us an immediate interpretation to language models. In particular we will define the concepts of partition function, internal energy and free energy for a language model, which offer insights into how language models work. Based on these results, we introduce a general concept of the geometrization of language models and define what is called the Boltzmann manifold. While the current LLMs are the special cases of the Boltzmann manifold.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Semantic Similarity Understanding in Arabic NLP with Nested Embedding Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for training Arabic nested embedding models through Matryoshka Embedding Learning, leveraging multilingual, Arabic-specific, and English-based models, to highlight the power of nested embeddings models in various Arabic NLP downstream tasks. Our innovative contribution includes the translation of various sentence similarity datasets into Arabic, enabling a comprehensive evaluation framework to compare these models across different dimensions. We trained several nested embedding models on the Arabic Natural Language Inference triplet dataset and assessed their performance using multiple evaluation metrics, including Pearson and Spearman correlations for cosine similarity, Manhattan distance, Euclidean distance, and dot product similarity. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the Matryoshka embedding models, particularly in capturing semantic nuances unique to the Arabic language. Results demonstrated that Arabic Matryoshka embedding models have superior performance in capturing semantic nuances unique to the Arabic language, significantly outperforming traditional models by up to 20-25\% across various similarity metrics. These results underscore the effectiveness of language-specific training and highlight the potential of Matryoshka models in enhancing semantic textual similarity tasks for Arabic NLP.</description>

      <title>Event-Arguments Extraction Corpus and Modeling using BERT for Arabic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-argument extraction is a challenging task, particularly in Arabic due to sparse linguistic resources. To fill this gap, we introduce the \hadath corpus ($550$k tokens) as an extension of Wojood, enriched with event-argument annotations. We used three types of event arguments: $agent$, $location$, and $date$, which we annotated as relation types. Our inter-annotator agreement evaluation resulted in $82.23\%$ $Kappa$ score and $87.2\%$ $F_1$-score. Additionally, we propose a novel method for event relation extraction using BERT, in which we treat the task as text entailment. This method achieves an $F_1$-score of $94.01\%$. To further evaluate the generalization of our proposed method, we collected and annotated another out-of-domain corpus (about $80$k tokens) called \testNLI and used it as a second test set, on which our approach achieved promising results ($83.59\%$ $F_1$-score).

      <title>Decomposed Prompting to Answer Questions on a Course Discussion Board</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and evaluate a question-answering system that uses decomposed prompting to classify and answer student questions on a course discussion board. Our system uses a large language model (LLM) to classify questions into one of four types: conceptual, homework, logistics, and not answerable. This enables us to employ a different strategy for answering questions that fall under different types. Using a variant of GPT-3, we achieve $81\%$ classification accuracy. We discuss our system's performance on answering conceptual questions from a machine learning course and various failure modes.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Pre-training Data Detection for Large Language Models via Surprising Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are extensively used, there are raising concerns regarding privacy, security, and copyright due to their opaque training data, which brings the problem of detecting pre-training data on the table. Current solutions to this problem leverage techniques explored in machine learning privacy such as Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which heavily depend on LLMs' capability of verbatim memorization. However, this reliance presents challenges, especially given the vast amount of training data and the restricted number of effective training epochs. In this paper, we propose an adaptive pre-training data detection method which alleviates this reliance and effectively amplify the identification. Our method adaptively locates \textit{surprising tokens} of the input. A token is surprising to a LLM if the prediction on the token is "certain but wrong", which refers to low Shannon entropy of the probability distribution and low probability of the ground truth token at the same time. By using the prediction probability of surprising tokens to measure \textit{surprising}, the detection method is achieved based on the simple hypothesis that seeing seen data is less surprising for the model compared with seeing unseen data. The method can be applied without any access to the the pre-training data corpus or additional training like reference models. Our approach exhibits a consistent enhancement compared to existing methods in diverse experiments conducted on various benchmarks and models, achieving a maximum improvement of 29.5\%. We also introduce a new benchmark Dolma-Book developed upon a novel framework, which employs book data collected both before and after model training to provide further evaluation.</description>

      <title>Model Attribution in Machine-Generated Disinformation: A Domain Generalization Approach with Supervised Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model attribution for machine-generated disinformation poses a significant challenge in understanding its origins and mitigating its spread. This task is especially challenging because modern large language models (LLMs) produce disinformation with human-like quality. Additionally, the diversity in prompting methods used to generate disinformation complicates accurate source attribution. These methods introduce domain-specific features that can mask the fundamental characteristics of the models. In this paper, we introduce the concept of model attribution as a domain generalization problem, where each prompting method represents a unique domain. We argue that an effective attribution model must be invariant to these domain-specific features. It should also be proficient in identifying the originating models across all scenarios, reflecting real-world detection challenges. To address this, we introduce a novel approach based on Supervised Contrastive Learning. This method is designed to enhance the model's robustness to variations in prompts and focuses on distinguishing between different source LLMs. We evaluate our model through rigorous experiments involving three common prompting methods: ``open-ended'', ``rewriting'', and ``paraphrasing'', and three advanced LLMs: ``llama 2'', ``chatgpt'', and ``vicuna''. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in model attribution tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse and unseen datasets.</description>

      <title>Beyond Silent Letters: Amplifying LLMs in Emotion Recognition with Vocal Nuances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to emotion detection in speech using Large Language Models (LLMs). We address the limitation of LLMs in processing audio inputs by translating speech characteristics into natural language descriptions. Our method integrates these descriptions into text prompts, enabling LLMs to perform multimodal emotion analysis without architectural modifications. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: IEMOCAP and MELD, demonstrating significant improvements in emotion recognition accuracy, particularly for high-quality audio data. Our experiments show that incorporating speech descriptions yields a 2 percentage point increase in weighted F1 score on IEMOCAP (from 70.111\% to 72.596\%). We also compare various LLM architectures and explore the effectiveness of different feature representations. Our findings highlight the potential of this approach in enhancing emotion detection capabilities of LLMs and underscore the importance of audio quality in speech-based emotion recognition tasks. We'll release the source code on Github.</description>

      <title>Performance of Recent Large Language Models for a Low-Resourced Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant advances in the past year. In addition to new versions of GPT and Llama, several other LLMs have been introduced recently. Some of these are open models available for download and modification.
  Although multilingual large language models have been available for some time, their performance on low-resourced languages such as Sinhala has been poor. We evaluated four recent LLMs on their performance directly in the Sinhala language, and by translation to and from English. We also evaluated their fine-tunability with a small amount of fine-tuning data. Claude and GPT 4o perform well out-of-the-box and do significantly better than previous versions. Llama and Mistral perform poorly but show some promise of improvement with fine tuning.</description>

      <title>GEGA: Graph Convolutional Networks and Evidence Retrieval Guided Attention for Enhanced Document-level Relation Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document-level relation extraction (DocRE) aims to extract relations between entities from unstructured document text. Compared to sentence-level relation extraction, it requires more complex semantic understanding from a broader text context. Currently, some studies are utilizing logical rules within evidence sentences to enhance the performance of DocRE. However, in the data without provided evidence sentences, researchers often obtain a list of evidence sentences for the entire document through evidence retrieval (ER). Therefore, DocRE suffers from two challenges: firstly, the relevance between evidence and entity pairs is weak; secondly, there is insufficient extraction of complex cross-relations between long-distance multi-entities. To overcome these challenges, we propose GEGA, a novel model for DocRE. The model leverages graph neural networks to construct multiple weight matrices, guiding attention allocation to evidence sentences. It also employs multi-scale representation aggregation to enhance ER. Subsequently, we integrate the most efficient evidence information to implement both fully supervised and weakly supervised training processes for the model. We evaluate the GEGA model on three widely used benchmark datasets: DocRED, Re-DocRED, and Revisit-DocRED. The experimental results indicate that our model has achieved comprehensive improvements compared to the existing SOTA model.</description>

      <title>Dancing in Chains: Reconciling Instruction Following and Faithfulness in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) need to follow human instructions while being faithful; yet, they often fail to achieve both. Here, we provide concrete evidence of a trade-off between instruction following (i.e., follow open-ended instructions) and faithfulness (i.e., ground responses in given context) when training LMs with these objectives. For instance, fine-tuning LLaMA-7B on instruction following datasets renders it less faithful. Conversely, instruction-tuned Vicuna-7B shows degraded performance at following instructions when further optimized on tasks that require contextual grounding. One common remedy is multi-task learning (MTL) with data mixing, yet it remains far from achieving a synergic outcome. We propose a simple yet effective method that relies on Rejection Sampling for Continued Self-instruction Tuning (ReSet), which significantly outperforms vanilla MTL. Surprisingly, we find that less is more, as training ReSet with high-quality, yet substantially smaller data (three-fold less) yields superior results. Our findings offer a better understanding of objective discrepancies in alignment training of LMs.</description>

      <title>Cost-Effective Hallucination Detection for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be prone to hallucinations - generating unreliable outputs that are unfaithful to their inputs, external facts or internally inconsistent. In this work, we address several challenges for post-hoc hallucination detection in production settings. Our pipeline for hallucination detection entails: first, producing a confidence score representing the likelihood that a generated answer is a hallucination; second, calibrating the score conditional on attributes of the inputs and candidate response; finally, performing detection by thresholding the calibrated score. We benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art scoring methods on different datasets, encompassing question answering, fact checking, and summarization tasks. We employ diverse LLMs to ensure a comprehensive assessment of performance. We show that calibrating individual scoring methods is critical for ensuring risk-aware downstream decision making. Based on findings that no individual score performs best in all situations, we propose a multi-scoring framework, which combines different scores and achieves top performance across all datasets. We further introduce cost-effective multi-scoring, which can match or even outperform more expensive detection methods, while significantly reducing computational overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verifying fact-checking claims poses a significant challenge, even for humans. Recent approaches have demonstrated that decomposing claims into relevant questions to gather evidence enhances the efficiency of the fact-checking process. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence showing that this question decomposition can be effectively automated. We demonstrate that smaller generative models, fine-tuned for the question generation task using data augmentation from various datasets, outperform large language models by up to 8%. Surprisingly, in some cases, the evidence retrieved using machine-generated questions proves to be significantly more effective for fact-checking than that obtained from human-written questions. We also perform manual evaluation of the decomposed questions to assess the quality of the questions generated.</description>

      <title>Improving Faithfulness of Large Language Models in Summarization via Sliding Generation and Self-Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various tasks, they are still suffering from the factual inconsistency problem called hallucinations. For instance, LLMs occasionally generate content that diverges from source article, and prefer to extract information that appears at the beginning and end of the context, especially in long document summarization. Inspired by these findings, we propose to improve the faithfulness of LLMs in summarization by impelling them to process the entire article more fairly and faithfully. We present a novel summary generation strategy, namely SliSum, which exploits the ideas of sliding windows and self-consistency. Specifically, SliSum divides the source article into overlapping windows, and utilizes LLM to generate local summaries for the content in the windows. Finally, SliSum aggregates all local summaries using clustering and majority voting algorithm to produce more faithful summary of entire article. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SliSum significantly improves the faithfulness of diverse LLMs including LLaMA-2, Claude-2 and GPT-3.5 in both short and long text summarization, while maintaining their fluency and informativeness and without additional fine-tuning and resources. We further conduct qualitative and quantitative studies to investigate why SliSum works and impacts of hyperparameters in SliSum on performance.</description>

      <title>On the Problem of Text-To-Speech Model Selection for Synthetic Data Generation in Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of neural text-to-speech (TTS) systems enabled its usage in other areas of natural language processing such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) or spoken language translation (SLT). Due to the large number of different TTS architectures and their extensions, selecting which TTS systems to use for synthetic data creation is not an easy task. We use the comparison of five different TTS decoder architectures in the scope of synthetic data generation to show the impact on CTC-based speech recognition training. We compare the recognition results to computable metrics like NISQA MOS and intelligibility, finding that there are no clear relations to the ASR performance. We also observe that for data generation auto-regressive decoding performs better than non-autoregressive decoding, and propose an approach to quantify TTS generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Maverick: Efficient and Accurate Coreference Resolution Defying Recent Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large autoregressive generative models have emerged as the cornerstone for achieving the highest performance across several Natural Language Processing tasks. However, the urge to attain superior results has, at times, led to the premature replacement of carefully designed task-specific approaches without exhaustive experimentation. The Coreference Resolution task is no exception; all recent state-of-the-art solutions adopt large generative autoregressive models that outperform encoder-based discriminative systems. In this work,we challenge this recent trend by introducing Maverick, a carefully designed - yet simple - pipeline, which enables running a state-of-the-art Coreference Resolution system within the constraints of an academic budget, outperforming models with up to 13 billion parameters with as few as 500 million parameters. Maverick achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CoNLL-2012 benchmark, training with up to 0.006x the memory resources and obtaining a 170x faster inference compared to previous state-of-the-art systems. We extensively validate the robustness of the Maverick framework with an array of diverse experiments, reporting improvements over prior systems in data-scarce, long-document, and out-of-domain settings. We release our code and models for research purposes at https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/maverick-coref.</description>

      <title>Generative Expressive Conversational Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) aims to express a target utterance with the proper speaking style in a user-agent conversation setting. Existing CSS methods employ effective multi-modal context modeling techniques to achieve empathy understanding and expression. However, they often need to design complex network architectures and meticulously optimize the modules within them. In addition, due to the limitations of small-scale datasets containing scripted recording styles, they often fail to simulate real natural conversational styles. To address the above issues, we propose a novel generative expressive CSS system, termed GPT-Talker.We transform the multimodal information of the multi-turn dialogue history into discrete token sequences and seamlessly integrate them to form a comprehensive user-agent dialogue context. Leveraging the power of GPT, we predict the token sequence, that includes both semantic and style knowledge, of response for the agent. After that, the expressive conversational speech is synthesized by the conversation-enriched VITS to deliver feedback to the user.Furthermore, we propose a large-scale Natural CSS Dataset called NCSSD, that includes both naturally recorded conversational speech in improvised styles and dialogues extracted from TV shows. It encompasses both Chinese and English languages, with a total duration of 236 hours.We conducted comprehensive experiments on the reliability of the NCSSD and the effectiveness of our GPT-Talker. Both subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art CSS systems significantly in terms of naturalness and expressiveness. The Code, Dataset, and Pre-trained Model are available at: https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/GPT-Talker.</description>

      <title>Data Contamination Report from the 2024 CONDA Shared Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 1st Workshop on Data Contamination (CONDA 2024) focuses on all relevant aspects of data contamination in natural language processing, where data contamination is understood as situations where evaluation data is included in pre-training corpora used to train large scale models, compromising evaluation results. The workshop fostered a shared task to collect evidence on data contamination in current available datasets and models. The goal of the shared task and associated database is to assist the community in understanding the extent of the problem and to assist researchers in avoiding reporting evaluation results on known contaminated resources. The shared task provides a structured, centralized public database for the collection of contamination evidence, open to contributions from the community via GitHub pool requests. This first compilation paper is based on 566 reported entries over 91 contaminated sources from a total of 23 contributors. The details of the individual contamination events are available in the platform. The platform continues to be online, open to contributions from the community.</description>

      <title>Tracing Intricate Cues in Dialogue: Joint Graph Structure and Sentiment Dynamics for Multimodal Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) has garnered substantial research attention recently. Existing MERC methods face several challenges: (1) they fail to fully harness direct inter-modal cues, possibly leading to less-than-thorough cross-modal modeling; (2) they concurrently extract information from the same and different modalities at each network layer, potentially triggering conflicts from the fusion of multi-source data; (3) they lack the agility required to detect dynamic sentimental changes, perhaps resulting in inaccurate classification of utterances with abrupt sentiment shifts. To address these issues, a novel approach named GraphSmile is proposed for tracking intricate emotional cues in multimodal dialogues. GraphSmile comprises two key components, i.e., GSF and SDP modules. GSF ingeniously leverages graph structures to alternately assimilate inter-modal and intra-modal emotional dependencies layer by layer, adequately capturing cross-modal cues while effectively circumventing fusion conflicts. SDP is an auxiliary task to explicitly delineate the sentiment dynamics between utterances, promoting the model's ability to distinguish sentimental discrepancies. Furthermore, GraphSmile is effortlessly applied to multimodal sentiment analysis in conversation (MSAC), forging a unified multimodal affective model capable of executing MERC and MSAC tasks. Empirical results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that GraphSmile can handle complex emotional and sentimental patterns, significantly outperforming baseline models.</description>

      <title>Generative Sentiment Analysis via Latent Category Distribution and Constrained Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-grained sentiment analysis involves extracting and organizing sentiment elements from textual data. However, existing approaches often overlook issues of category semantic inclusion and overlap, as well as inherent structural patterns within the target sequence. This study introduces a generative sentiment analysis model. To address the challenges related to category semantic inclusion and overlap, a latent category distribution variable is introduced. By reconstructing the input of a variational autoencoder, the model learns the intensity of the relationship between categories and text, thereby improving sequence generation. Additionally, a trie data structure and constrained decoding strategy are utilized to exploit structural patterns, which in turn reduces the search space and regularizes the generation process. Experimental results on the Restaurant-ACOS and Laptop-ACOS datasets demonstrate a significant performance improvement compared to baseline models. Ablation experiments further confirm the effectiveness of latent category distribution and constrained decoding strategy.</description>

      <title>PMoE: Progressive Mixture of Experts with Asymmetric Transformer for Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter significant challenges in continual learning due to catastrophic forgetting, where new information overwrites previously acquired knowledge. This limitation leads to substantial environmental and economic waste. In this study, we introduce the PMoE, Progressive Mixture of Experts with Asymmetric Transformer, which aims to minimize forgetting by utilizing an asymmetric design with shallow layers dedicated to general knowledge and deep layers for new knowledge. PMoE incorporates progressively added experts in deep layers and a router that allocates new knowledge to the appropriate experts efficiently. The router, positioned adjacent to the deep layers, utilizes deep features aggregating consolidated information. This enables the router to perform efficiently, allocating new knowledge to the appropriate experts, which progressively increase in the deep layers. Extensive experiments on TRACE datasets and general language understanding datasets demonstrate that the proposed PMoE outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>TAROT: Task-Oriented Authorship Obfuscation Using Policy Optimization Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Authorship obfuscation aims to disguise the identity of an author within a text by altering the writing style, vocabulary, syntax, and other linguistic features associated with the text author. This alteration needs to balance privacy and utility. While strong obfuscation techniques can effectively hide the author's identity, they often degrade the quality and usefulness of the text for its intended purpose. Conversely, maintaining high utility tends to provide insufficient privacy, making it easier for an adversary to de-anonymize the author. Thus, achieving an optimal trade-off between these two conflicting objectives is crucial. In this paper, we propose TAROT: Task-Oriented Authorship Obfuscation Using Policy Optimization, a new unsupervised authorship obfuscation method whose goal is to optimize the privacy-utility trade-off by regenerating the entire text considering its downstream utility. Our approach leverages policy optimization as a fine-tuning paradigm over small language models in order to rewrite texts by preserving author identity and downstream task utility. We show that our approach largely reduce the accuracy of attackers while preserving utility. We make our code and models publicly available.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Cross-Domain Dialogue State Tracking via Dual Low-Rank Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST) seeks to enable dialogue systems to transition to unfamiliar domains without manual annotation or extensive retraining. Prior research has approached this objective by embedding prompts into language models (LMs). Common methodologies include integrating prompts at the input layer or introducing learnable variables at each transformer layer. Nonetheless, each strategy exhibits inherent limitations. Prompts integrated at the input layer risk underutilization, with their impact potentially diminishing across successive transformer layers. Conversely, the addition of learnable variables to each layer can complicate the training process and increase inference latency. To tackle the issues mentioned above, this paper proposes Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (DualLoRA), a plug-and-play architecture designed for zero-shot DST. DualLoRA incorporates two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) components, targeting both dialogue context processing and prompt optimization, to ensure the comprehensive influence of prompts throughout the transformer model layers. This is achieved without incurring additional inference latency, showcasing an efficient integration into existing architectures. Through rigorous evaluation on the MultiWOZ and SGD datasets, DualLoRA demonstrates notable improvements across multiple domains, outperforming traditional baseline methods in zero-shot settings. Our code is accessible at: \url{https://github.com/suntea233/DualLoRA}.</description>

      <title>Towards Achieving Human Parity on End-to-end Simultaneous Speech Translation via LLM Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Cross Language Agent -- Simultaneous Interpretation, CLASI, a high-quality and human-like Simultaneous Speech Translation (SiST) System. Inspired by professional human interpreters, we utilize a novel data-driven read-write strategy to balance the translation quality and latency. To address the challenge of translating in-domain terminologies, CLASI employs a multi-modal retrieving module to obtain relevant information to augment the translation. Supported by LLMs, our approach can generate error-tolerated translation by considering the input audio, historical context, and retrieved information. Experimental results show that our system outperforms other systems by significant margins. Aligned with professional human interpreters, we evaluate CLASI with a better human evaluation metric, valid information proportion (VIP), which measures the amount of information that can be successfully conveyed to the listeners. In the real-world scenarios, where the speeches are often disfluent, informal, and unclear, CLASI achieves VIP of 81.3% and 78.0% for Chinese-to-English and English-to-Chinese translation directions, respectively. In contrast, state-of-the-art commercial or open-source systems only achieve 35.4% and 41.6%. On the extremely hard dataset, where other systems achieve under 13% VIP, CLASI can still achieve 70% VIP.</description>

      <title>Defending Jailbreak Attack in VLMs via Cross-modality Information Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) extend the capacity of LLMs to comprehensively understand vision information, achieving remarkable performance in many vision-centric tasks. Despite that, recent studies have shown that these models are susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which refer to an exploitative technique where malicious users can break the safety alignment of the target model and generate misleading and harmful answers. This potential threat is caused by both the inherent vulnerabilities of LLM and the larger attack scope introduced by vision input. To enhance the security of VLMs against jailbreak attacks, researchers have developed various defense techniques. However, these methods either require modifications to the model's internal structure or demand significant computational resources during the inference phase. Multimodal information is a double-edged sword. While it increases the risk of attacks, it also provides additional data that can enhance safeguards. Inspired by this, we propose $\underline{\textbf{C}}$ross-modality $\underline{\textbf{I}}$nformation $\underline{\textbf{DE}}$tecto$\underline{\textbf{R}}$ ($\textit{CIDER})$, a plug-and-play jailbreaking detector designed to identify maliciously perturbed image inputs, utilizing the cross-modal similarity between harmful queries and adversarial images. This simple yet effective cross-modality information detector, $\textit{CIDER}$, is independent of the target VLMs and requires less computation cost. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of $\textit{CIDER}$, as well as its transferability to both white-box and black-box VLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), achieving excellent empathetic response capabilities has become a crucial prerequisite. Consequently, managing and understanding empathetic datasets have gained increasing significance. However, empathetic data are typically human-labeled, leading to insufficient datasets and wasted human labor. In this work, we present Synth-Empathy, an LLM-based data generation and quality and diversity selection pipeline that automatically generates high-quality empathetic data while discarding low-quality data. With the data generated from a low empathetic model, we are able to further improve empathetic response performance and achieve state-of-the-art (SoTA) results across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, our model achieves SoTA performance on various human evaluation benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in real-world applications. Furthermore, we show the trade-off between data quantity and quality, providing insights into empathetic data generation and selection.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Conversational Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the success of integrating large language models into the development of conversational systems, many studies have shown the effectiveness of retrieving and augmenting external knowledge for informative responses. Hence, many existing studies commonly assume the always need for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in a conversational system without explicit control. This raises a research question about such a necessity. In this study, we propose to investigate the need for each turn of system response to be augmented with external knowledge. In particular, by leveraging human judgements on the binary choice of adaptive augmentation, we develop RAGate, a gating model, which models conversation context and relevant inputs to predict if a conversational system requires RAG for improved responses. We conduct extensive experiments on devising and applying RAGate to conversational models and well-rounded analyses of different conversational scenarios. Our experimental results and analysis indicate the effective application of RAGate in RAG-based conversational systems in identifying system responses for appropriate RAG with high-quality responses and a high generation confidence. This study also identifies the correlation between the generation's confidence level and the relevance of the augmented knowledge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ShieldGemma, a comprehensive suite of LLM-based safety content moderation models built upon Gemma2. These models provide robust, state-of-the-art predictions of safety risks across key harm types (sexually explicit, dangerous content, harassment, hate speech) in both user input and LLM-generated output. By evaluating on both public and internal benchmarks, we demonstrate superior performance compared to existing models, such as Llama Guard (+10.8\% AU-PRC on public benchmarks) and WildCard (+4.3\%). Additionally, we present a novel LLM-based data curation pipeline, adaptable to a variety of safety-related tasks and beyond. We have shown strong generalization performance for model trained mainly on synthetic data. By releasing ShieldGemma, we provide a valuable resource to the research community, advancing LLM safety and enabling the creation of more effective content moderation solutions for developers.</description>

      <title>LLM-Find: An Autonomous GIS Agent Framework for Geospatial Data Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Powered by the emerging large language models (LLMs), autonomous geographic information systems (GIS) agents have the potential to accomplish spatial analyses and cartographic tasks. However, a research gap exists to support fully autonomous GIS agents: how to enable agents to discover and download the necessary data for geospatial analyses. This study proposes LLM-Find, an autonomous GIS agent framework capable of selecting and fetching required geospatial data by generating, executing, and debugging programs. LLM-Find utilizes the LLM as the decision-maker, selects the appropriate data source (s) from a pre-defined source list, and fetches the data from the chosen source. Each data source has a handbook that records the metadata and technical details for data retrieval. The proposed framework is designed in a plug-and-play style to ensure flexibility and extensibility. Human users or autonomous data scrawlers can add a new data source by adding a new handbook. We developed a prototype agent based on LLM-Find, and experiment results demonstrate its capability of retrieving data from various sources including OpenStreetMap, administrative boundaries and demographic data from the US Census Bureau, satellite basemaps from ESRI World Imagery, weather data from a commercial provider, and the COVID-19 data from the NYTimes GitHub. Our study is among the first attempts to develop an autonomous geospatial data retrieval agent.</description>

      <title>Multi-Grained Query-Guided Set Prediction Network for Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) is an emerging information extraction (IE) task, aiming to simultaneously extract entity spans, types, and entity-matched bounding box groundings in images from given sentence-image pairs data. Recent unified methods employing machine reading comprehension (MRC-based) frameworks or sequence generation-based models face challenges in understanding the relationships of multimodal entities. MRC-based frameworks, utilizing human-designed queries, struggle to model intra-entity connections. Meanwhile, sequence generation-based outputs excessively rely on inter-entity dependencies due to pre-defined decoding order. To tackle these, we propose a novel unified framework named Multi-grained Query-guided Set Prediction Network (MQSPN) to learn appropriate relationships at intra-entity and inter-entity levels. Specifically, MQSPN consists of a Multi-grained Query Set (MQS) and a Multimodal Set Prediction Network (MSP). MQS combines specific type-grained and learnable entity-grained queries to adaptively strengthen intra-entity connections by explicitly aligning visual regions with textual spans. Based on solid intra-entity modeling, MSP reformulates GMNER as a set prediction, enabling the parallel prediction of multimodal entities in a non-autoregressive manner, eliminating redundant dependencies from preceding sequences, and guiding models to establish appropriate inter-entity relationships from a global matching perspective. Additionally, to boost better alignment of two-level relationships, we also incorporate a Query-guided Fusion Net (QFNet) to work as a glue network between MQS and MSP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performances in widely used benchmarks. Notably, our method improves 2.83% F1 in the difficult fine-grained GMNER benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the field of NL2SQL has made significant advancements in translating natural language instructions into executable SQL scripts for data querying and processing, achieving full automation within the broader data science pipeline - encompassing data querying, analysis, visualization, and reporting - remains a complex challenge. This study introduces SageCopilot, an advanced, industry-grade system system that automates the data science pipeline by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), Autonomous Agents (AutoAgents), and Language User Interfaces (LUIs). Specifically, SageCopilot incorporates a two-phase design: an online component refining users' inputs into executable scripts through In-Context Learning (ICL) and running the scripts for results reporting &amp; visualization, and an offline preparing demonstrations requested by ICL in the online phase. A list of trending strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and prompt-tuning have been used to augment SageCopilot for enhanced performance. Through rigorous testing and comparative analysis against prompt-based solutions, SageCopilot has been empirically validated to achieve superior end-to-end performance in generating or executing scripts and offering results with visualization, backed by real-world datasets. Our in-depth ablation studies highlight the individual contributions of various components and strategies used by SageCopilot to the end-to-end correctness for data sciences.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Adversarial Text Attacks on BERT Models with Projected Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks against deep learning models represent a major threat to the security and reliability of natural language processing (NLP) systems. In this paper, we propose a modification to the BERT-Attack framework, integrating Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to enhance its effectiveness and robustness. The original BERT-Attack, designed for generating adversarial examples against BERT-based models, suffers from limitations such as a fixed perturbation budget and a lack of consideration for semantic similarity. The proposed approach in this work, PGD-BERT-Attack, addresses these limitations by leveraging PGD to iteratively generate adversarial examples while ensuring both imperceptibility and semantic similarity to the original input. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of PGD-BERT-Attack compared to the original BERT-Attack and other baseline methods. The results demonstrate that PGD-BERT-Attack achieves higher success rates in causing misclassification while maintaining low perceptual changes. Furthermore, PGD-BERT-Attack produces adversarial instances that exhibit greater semantic resemblance to the initial input, enhancing their applicability in real-world scenarios. Overall, the proposed modification offers a more effective and robust approach to adversarial attacks on BERT-based models, thus contributing to the advancement of defense against attacks on NLP systems.</description>

      <title>GenRec: Generative Personalized Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation is a task to capture hidden user preferences from historical user item interaction data. Significant progress has been made in this domain by leveraging classification based learning methods. Inspired by the recent paradigm of 'pretrain, prompt and predict' in NLP, we consider sequential recommendation as a sequence to sequence generation task and propose a novel model named Generative Recommendation (GenRec). Unlike classification based models that learn explicit user and item representations, GenRec utilizes the sequence modeling capability of Transformer and adopts the masked item prediction objective to effectively learn the hidden bidirectional sequential patterns. Different from existing generative sequential recommendation models, GenRec does not rely on manually designed hard prompts. The input to GenRec is textual user item sequence and the output is top ranked next items. Moreover, GenRec is lightweight and requires only a few hours to train effectively in low-resource settings, making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios and helping to democratize large language models in the sequential recommendation domain. Our extensive experiments have demonstrated that GenRec generalizes on various public real-world datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results. Our experiments also validate the effectiveness of the the proposed masked item prediction objective that improves the model performance by a large margin.</description>

      <title>Advancing Vietnamese Visual Question Answering with Transformer and Convolutional Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) has recently emerged as a potential research domain, captivating the interest of many in the field of artificial intelligence and computer vision. Despite the prevalence of approaches in English, there is a notable lack of systems specifically developed for certain languages, particularly Vietnamese. This study aims to bridge this gap by conducting comprehensive experiments on the Vietnamese Visual Question Answering (ViVQA) dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed model. In response to community interest, we have developed a model that enhances image representation capabilities, thereby improving overall performance in the ViVQA system. Specifically, our model integrates the Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training with frozen unimodal models (BLIP-2) and the convolutional neural network EfficientNet to extract and process both local and global features from images. This integration leverages the strengths of transformer-based architectures for capturing comprehensive contextual information and convolutional networks for detailed local features. By freezing the parameters of these pre-trained models, we significantly reduce the computational cost and training time, while maintaining high performance. This approach significantly improves image representation and enhances the performance of existing VQA systems. We then leverage a multi-modal fusion module based on a general-purpose multi-modal foundation model (BEiT-3) to fuse the information between visual and textual features. Our experimental findings demonstrate that our model surpasses competing baselines, achieving promising performance. This is particularly evident in its accuracy of $71.04\%$ on the test set of the ViVQA dataset, marking a significant advancement in our research area. The code is available at https://github.com/nngocson2002/ViVQA.</description>

      <title>Multi-Level Querying using A Knowledge Pyramid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the need for improved precision in existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods that primarily focus on enhancing recall. We propose a multi-layer knowledge pyramid approach within the RAG framework to achieve a better balance between precision and recall. The knowledge pyramid consists of three layers: Ontologies, Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and chunk-based raw text. We employ cross-layer augmentation techniques for comprehensive knowledge coverage and dynamic updates of the Ontology schema and instances. To ensure compactness, we utilize cross-layer filtering methods for knowledge condensation in KGs. Our approach, named PolyRAG, follows a waterfall model for retrieval, starting from the top of the pyramid and progressing down until a confident answer is obtained. We introduce two benchmarks for domain-specific knowledge retrieval, one in the academic domain and the other in the financial domain. The effectiveness of the methods has been validated through comprehensive experiments by outperforming 19 SOTA methods. An encouraging observation is that the proposed method has augmented the GPT-4, providing 395\% F1 gain by improving its performance from 0.1636 to 0.8109.</description>

      <title>Prompting Medical Large Vision-Language Models to Diagnose Pathologies by Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant success in recent years, and they have been extended to the medical domain. Although demonstrating satisfactory performance on medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, Medical LVLMs (MLVLMs) suffer from the hallucination problem, which makes them fail to diagnose complex pathologies. Moreover, they readily fail to learn minority pathologies due to imbalanced training data. We propose two prompting strategies for MLVLMs that reduce hallucination and improve VQA performance. In the first strategy, we provide a detailed explanation of the queried pathology. In the second strategy, we fine-tune a cheap, weak learner to achieve high performance on a specific metric, and textually provide its judgment to the MLVLM. Tested on the MIMIC-CXR-JPG and Chexpert datasets, our methods significantly improve the diagnostic F1 score, with the highest increase being 0.27. We also demonstrate that our prompting strategies can be extended to general LVLM domains. Based on POPE metrics, it effectively suppresses the false negative predictions of existing LVLMs and improves Recall by approximately 0.07.</description>

      <title>Towards interfacing large language models with ASR systems using confidence measures and prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in parameter size and capabilities, such as interaction through prompting, they open up new ways of interfacing with automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems beyond rescoring n-best lists. This work investigates post-hoc correction of ASR transcripts with LLMs. To avoid introducing errors into likely accurate transcripts, we propose a range of confidence-based filtering methods. Our results indicate that this can improve the performance of less competitive ASR systems.</description>

      <title>MLLM Is a Strong Reranker: Advancing Multimodal Retrieval-augmented Generation via Knowledge-enhanced Reranking and Noise-injected Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing and generating content across multiple data modalities, including text, images, audio, and video. However, a significant drawback of MLLMs is their reliance on static training data, leading to outdated information and limited contextual awareness. This static nature hampers their ability to provide accurate, up-to-date responses, particularly in dynamic or rapidly evolving contexts. Integrating Multimodal Retrieval-augmented Generation (Multimodal RAG) offers a promising solution, but the system would inevitably encounter the multi-granularity noisy correspondence (MNC) problem, which involves two types of noise: coarse-grained (query-caption) and fine-grained (query-image). This noise hinders accurate retrieval and generation. In this work, we propose \textbf{RagLLaVA}, a novel framework with knowledge-enhanced reranking and noise-injected training, to address these limitations. We instruction-tune the MLLM with a simple yet effective instruction template to induce its ranking ability and serve it as a reranker to precisely filter the top-k retrieved images. For generation, we inject visual noise during training at the data and token levels to enhance the generator's robustness. Extensive experiments are conducted on the subsets of two datasets that require retrieving and reasoning over images to answer a given query. Our results demonstrate the superiority of RagLLaVA in retrieving accurately and generating robustly. Code and models are available at https://github.com/IDEA-FinAI/RagLLaVA.</description>

      <title>Navigating Beyond Instructions: Vision-and-Language Navigation in Obstructed Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world navigation often involves dealing with unexpected obstructions such as closed doors, moved objects, and unpredictable entities. However, mainstream Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks typically assume instructions perfectly align with the fixed and predefined navigation graphs without any obstructions. This assumption overlooks potential discrepancies in actual navigation graphs and given instructions, which can cause major failures for both indoor and outdoor agents. To address this issue, we integrate diverse obstructions into the R2R dataset by modifying both the navigation graphs and visual observations, introducing an innovative dataset and task, R2R with UNexpected Obstructions (R2R-UNO). R2R-UNO contains various types and numbers of path obstructions to generate instruction-reality mismatches for VLN research. Experiments on R2R-UNO reveal that state-of-the-art VLN methods inevitably encounter significant challenges when facing such mismatches, indicating that they rigidly follow instructions rather than navigate adaptively. Therefore, we propose a novel method called ObVLN (Obstructed VLN), which includes a curriculum training strategy and virtual graph construction to help agents effectively adapt to obstructed environments. Empirical results show that ObVLN not only maintains robust performance in unobstructed scenarios but also achieves a substantial performance advantage with unexpected obstructions.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs "Reason" in Music? An Evaluation of LLMs' Capability of Music Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic Music, akin to language, can be encoded in discrete symbols. Recent research has extended the application of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama2 to the symbolic music domain including understanding and generation. Yet scant research explores the details of how these LLMs perform on advanced music understanding and conditioned generation, especially from the multi-step reasoning perspective, which is a critical aspect in the conditioned, editable, and interactive human-computer co-creation process. This study conducts a thorough investigation of LLMs' capability and limitations in symbolic music processing. We identify that current LLMs exhibit poor performance in song-level multi-step music reasoning, and typically fail to leverage learned music knowledge when addressing complex musical tasks. An analysis of LLMs' responses highlights distinctly their pros and cons. Our findings suggest achieving advanced musical capability is not intrinsically obtained by LLMs, and future research should focus more on bridging the gap between music knowledge and reasoning, to improve the co-creation experience for musicians.</description>

      <title>The Llama 3 Herd of Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems are powered by foundation models. This paper presents a new set of foundation models, called Llama 3. It is a herd of language models that natively support multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is a dense Transformer with 405B parameters and a context window of up to 128K tokens. This paper presents an extensive empirical evaluation of Llama 3. We find that Llama 3 delivers comparable quality to leading language models such as GPT-4 on a plethora of tasks. We publicly release Llama 3, including pre-trained and post-trained versions of the 405B parameter language model and our Llama Guard 3 model for input and output safety. The paper also presents the results of experiments in which we integrate image, video, and speech capabilities into Llama 3 via a compositional approach. We observe this approach performs competitively with the state-of-the-art on image, video, and speech recognition tasks. The resulting models are not yet being broadly released as they are still under development.</description>

      <title>Vision-Language Model Based Handwriting Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Handwriting Verification is a critical in document forensics. Deep learning based approaches often face skepticism from forensic document examiners due to their lack of explainability and reliance on extensive training data and handcrafted features. This paper explores using Vision Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAI's GPT-4o and Google's PaliGemma, to address these challenges. By leveraging their Visual Question Answering capabilities and 0-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, our goal is to provide clear, human-understandable explanations for model decisions. Our experiments on the CEDAR handwriting dataset demonstrate that VLMs offer enhanced interpretability, reduce the need for large training datasets, and adapt better to diverse handwriting styles. However, results show that the CNN-based ResNet-18 architecture outperforms the 0-shot CoT prompt engineering approach with GPT-4o (Accuracy: 70%) and supervised fine-tuned PaliGemma (Accuracy: 71%), achieving an accuracy of 84% on the CEDAR AND dataset. These findings highlight the potential of VLMs in generating human-interpretable decisions while underscoring the need for further advancements to match the performance of specialized deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Safetywashing: Do AI Safety Benchmarks Actually Measure Safety Progress?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems grow more powerful, there has been increasing interest in "AI safety" research to address emerging and future risks. However, the field of AI safety remains poorly defined and inconsistently measured, leading to confusion about how researchers can contribute. This lack of clarity is compounded by the unclear relationship between AI safety benchmarks and upstream general capabilities (e.g., general knowledge and reasoning). To address these issues, we conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis of AI safety benchmarks, empirically analyzing their correlation with general capabilities across dozens of models and providing a survey of existing directions in AI safety. Our findings reveal that many safety benchmarks highly correlate with upstream model capabilities, potentially enabling "safetywashing" -- where capability improvements are misrepresented as safety advancements. Based on these findings, we propose an empirical foundation for developing more meaningful safety metrics and define AI safety in a machine learning research context as a set of clearly delineated research goals that are empirically separable from generic capabilities advancements. In doing so, we aim to provide a more rigorous framework for AI safety research, advancing the science of safety evaluations and clarifying the path towards measurable progress.</description>

      <title>SILO Language Models: Isolating Legal Risk In a Nonparametric Datastore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The legality of training language models (LMs) on copyrighted or otherwise restricted data is under intense debate. However, as we show, model performance significantly degrades if trained only on low-risk text (e.g., out-of-copyright books or government documents), due to its limited size and domain coverage. We present SILO, a new language model that manages this risk-performance tradeoff during inference. SILO is built by (1) training a parametric LM on Open License Corpus (OLC), a new corpus we curate with 228B tokens of public domain and permissively licensed text and (2) augmenting it with a more general and easily modifiable nonparametric datastore (e.g., containing copyrighted books or news) that is only queried during inference. The datastore allows use of high-risk data without training on it, supports sentence-level data attribution, and enables data producers to opt out from the model by removing content from the store. These capabilities can foster compliance with data-use regulations such as the fair use doctrine in the United States and the GDPR in the European Union. Our experiments show that the parametric LM struggles on domains not covered by OLC. However, access to the datastore greatly improves out of domain performance, closing 90% of the performance gap with an LM trained on the Pile, a more diverse corpus with mostly high-risk text. We also analyze which nonparametric approach works best, where the remaining errors lie, and how performance scales with datastore size. Our results suggest that it is possible to build high quality language models while mitigating their legal risk.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Learning Curves During Language Model Pre-Training: Learning, Forgetting, and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How do language models learn to make predictions during pre-training? To study this, we extract learning curves from five autoregressive English language model pre-training runs, for 1M unseen tokens in context. We observe that the language models generate short repetitive phrases before learning to generate longer and more coherent text. We also find that individual tokens often exhibit sudden increases or decreases in loss that are surprisingly consistent across pre-training runs. To better understand these fluctuations, we quantify the final surprisal, within-run variability, age of acquisition, forgettability, and cross-run variability of learning curves for individual tokens in context. More frequent tokens reach lower final surprisals, exhibit less variability within and across pre-training runs, are learned earlier, and are less likely to be "forgotten" during pre-training. Higher n-gram probabilities further accentuate these effects. Independent of the target token, shorter and more frequent contexts correlate with marginally more stable and quickly acquired predictions. Based on our results, we argue for the existence of sequential learning dependencies between different model capabilities, and we characterize language model learning as early n-gram learning before gradual refinement of tail n-gram predictions.</description>

      <title>LLM in a flash: Efficient Large Language Model Inference with Limited Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are central to modern natural language processing, delivering exceptional performance in various tasks. However, their substantial computational and memory requirements present challenges, especially for devices with limited DRAM capacity. This paper tackles the challenge of efficiently running LLMs that exceed the available DRAM capacity by storing the model parameters in flash memory, but bringing them on demand to DRAM. Our method involves constructing an inference cost model that takes into account the characteristics of flash memory, guiding us to optimize in two critical areas: reducing the volume of data transferred from flash and reading data in larger, more contiguous chunks. Within this hardware-informed framework, we introduce two principal techniques. First, "windowing" strategically reduces data transfer by reusing previously activated neurons, and second, "row-column bundling", tailored to the sequential data access strengths of flash memory, increases the size of data chunks read from flash memory. These methods collectively enable running models up to twice the size of the available DRAM, with a 4-5x and 20-25x increase in inference speed compared to naive loading approaches in CPU and GPU, respectively. Our integration of sparsity awareness, context-adaptive loading, and a hardware-oriented design paves the way for effective inference of LLMs on devices with limited memory.</description>

      <title>AttackEval: How to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Jailbreak Attacking on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09002v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring the security of large language models (LLMs) against attacks has become increasingly urgent, with jailbreak attacks representing one of the most sophisticated threats. To deal with such risks, we introduce an innovative framework that can help evaluate the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks on LLMs. Unlike traditional binary evaluations focusing solely on the robustness of LLMs, our method assesses the effectiveness of the attacking prompts themselves. We present two distinct evaluation frameworks: a coarse-grained evaluation and a fine-grained evaluation. Each framework uses a scoring range from 0 to 1, offering unique perspectives and allowing for the assessment of attack effectiveness in different scenarios. Additionally, we develop a comprehensive ground truth dataset specifically tailored for jailbreak prompts. This dataset serves as a crucial benchmark for our current study and provides a foundational resource for future research. By comparing with traditional evaluation methods, our study shows that the current results align with baseline metrics while offering a more nuanced and fine-grained assessment. It also helps identify potentially harmful attack prompts that might appear harmless in traditional evaluations. Overall, our work establishes a solid foundation for assessing a broader range of attack prompts in the area of prompt injection.</description>

      <title>Designing Informative Metrics for Few-Shot Example Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03861v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pretrained language models (PLMs) have shown remarkable few-shot learning capabilities when provided with properly formatted examples. However, selecting the "best" examples remains an open challenge. We propose a complexity-based prompt selection approach for sequence tagging tasks. This approach avoids the training of a dedicated model for selection of examples, and instead uses certain metrics to align the syntactico-semantic complexity of test sentences and examples. We use both sentence- and word-level metrics to match the complexity of examples to the (test) sentence being considered. Our results demonstrate that our approach extracts greater performance from PLMs: it achieves state-of-the-art performance on few-shot NER, achieving a 5% absolute improvement in F1 score on the CoNLL2003 dataset for GPT-4. We also see large gains of upto 28.85 points (F1/Acc.) in smaller models like GPT-j-6B.</description>

      <title>Learning to Plan for Language Modeling from Unlabeled Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By training to predict the next token in an unlabeled corpus, large language models learn to perform many tasks without any labeled data. However, their next-token-prediction objective arguably limits their performance in scenarios that require planning, such as writing a coherent article. In this paper, we train a module for planning the future writing process via a self-supervised learning objective. Given the textual context, this planning module learns to predict future abstract writing actions, which correspond to centroids in a clustered text embedding space. By conditioning on these actions, our model extends the successful language model formula to more abstract planning in an unsupervised way. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method improves language modeling performance in general, particularly with respect to the text structure. Because our framework uses a planner module that is unsupervised and external to the language model, new planner modules can be trained at large scale and easily be shared with the community.</description>

      <title>Do Large Language Models Understand Conversational Implicature -- A case study with a chinese sitcom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the non-literal meaning of an utterance is critical for large language models (LLMs) to become human-like social communicators. In this work, we introduce SwordsmanImp, the first Chinese multi-turn-dialogue-based dataset aimed at conversational implicature, sourced from dialogues in the Chinese sitcom $\textit{My Own Swordsman}$. It includes 200 carefully handcrafted questions, all annotated on which Gricean maxims have been violated. We test eight close-source and open-source LLMs under two tasks: a multiple-choice question task and an implicature explanation task. Our results show that GPT-4 attains human-level accuracy (94%) on multiple-choice questions. CausalLM demonstrates a 78.5% accuracy following GPT-4. Other models, including GPT-3.5 and several open-source models, demonstrate a lower accuracy ranging from 20% to 60% on multiple-choice questions. Human raters were asked to rate the explanation of the implicatures generated by LLMs on their reasonability, logic and fluency. While all models generate largely fluent and self-consistent text, their explanations score low on reasonability except for GPT-4, suggesting that most LLMs cannot produce satisfactory explanations of the implicatures in the conversation. Moreover, we find LLMs' performance does not vary significantly by Gricean maxims, suggesting that LLMs do not seem to process implicatures derived from different maxims differently. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/sjtu-compling/llm-pragmatics.</description>

      <title>RoseLoRA: Row and Column-wise Sparse Low-rank Adaptation of Pre-trained Language Model for Knowledge Editing and Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pre-trained language models, trained on large-scale corpora, demonstrate strong generalizability across various NLP tasks. Fine-tuning these models for specific tasks typically involves updating all parameters, which is resource-intensive. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as the popular LoRA family, introduce low-rank matrices to learn only a few parameters efficiently. However, during inference, the product of these matrices updates all pre-trained parameters, complicating tasks like knowledge editing that require selective updates. We propose a novel PEFT method, which conducts \textbf{r}ow and c\textbf{o}lumn-wise spar\textbf{se} \textbf{lo}w-\textbf{r}ank \textbf{a}daptation (RoseLoRA), to address this challenge. RoseLoRA identifies and updates only the most important parameters for a specific task, maintaining efficiency while preserving other model knowledge. By adding a sparsity constraint on the product of low-rank matrices and converting it to row and column-wise sparsity, we ensure efficient and precise model updates. Our theoretical analysis guarantees the lower bound of the sparsity with respective to the matrix product. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks across twenty datasets demonstrate that RoseLoRA outperforms baselines in both general fine-tuning and knowledge editing tasks.</description>

      <title>Definition generation for lexical semantic change detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use contextualized word definitions generated by large language models as semantic representations in the task of diachronic lexical semantic change detection (LSCD). In short, generated definitions are used as `senses', and the change score of a target word is retrieved by comparing their distributions in two time periods under comparison. On the material of five datasets and three languages, we show that generated definitions are indeed specific and general enough to convey a signal sufficient to rank sets of words by the degree of their semantic change over time. Our approach is on par with or outperforms prior non-supervised sense-based LSCD methods. At the same time, it preserves interpretability and allows to inspect the reasons behind a specific shift in terms of discrete definitions-as-senses. This is another step in the direction of explainable semantic change modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the temporal dynamics of language processing by examining the alignment between word representations from a pre-trained transformer-based language model, and EEG data. Using a Temporal Response Function (TRF) model, we investigate how neural activity corresponds to model representations across different layers, revealing insights into the interaction between artificial language models and brain responses during language comprehension. Our analysis reveals patterns in TRFs from distinct layers, highlighting varying contributions to lexical and compositional processing. Additionally, we used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to isolate part-of-speech (POS) representations, offering insights into their influence on neural responses and the underlying mechanisms of syntactic processing. These findings underscore EEG's utility for probing language processing dynamics with high temporal resolution. By bridging artificial language models and neural activity, this study advances our understanding of their interaction at fine timescales.</description>

      <title>Latent Causal Probing: A Formal Perspective on Probing with Causal Models of Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As language models (LMs) deliver increasing performance on a range of NLP tasks, probing classifiers have become an indispensable technique in the effort to better understand their inner workings. A typical setup involves (1) defining an auxiliary task consisting of a dataset of text annotated with labels, then (2) supervising small classifiers to predict the labels from the representations of a pretrained LM as it processed the dataset. A high probing accuracy is interpreted as evidence that the LM has learned to perform the auxiliary task as an unsupervised byproduct of its original pretraining objective. Despite the widespread usage of probes, however, the robust design and analysis of probing experiments remains a challenge. We develop a formal perspective on probing using structural causal models (SCM). Specifically, given an SCM which explains the distribution of tokens observed during training, we frame the central hypothesis as whether the LM has learned to represent the latent variables of the SCM. Empirically, we extend a recent study of LMs in the context of a synthetic grid-world navigation task, where having an exact model of the underlying causal structure allows us to draw strong inferences from the result of probing experiments. Our techniques provide robust empirical evidence for the ability of LMs to induce the latent concepts underlying text.</description>

Abstract: Understanding knowledge mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for advancing towards trustworthy AGI. This paper reviews knowledge mechanism analysis from a novel taxonomy including knowledge utilization and evolution. Knowledge utilization delves into the mechanism of memorization, comprehension and application, and creation. Knowledge evolution focuses on the dynamic progression of knowledge within individual and group LLMs. Moreover, we discuss what knowledge LLMs have learned, the reasons for the fragility of parametric knowledge, and the potential dark knowledge (hypothesis) that will be challenging to address. We hope this work can help understand knowledge in LLMs and provide insights for future research.</description>

      <title>A Role-specific Guided Large Language Model for Ophthalmic Consultation Based on Stylistic Differentiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18483v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ophthalmology consultations are crucial for diagnosing, treating, and preventing eye diseases. However, the growing demand for consultations exceeds the availability of ophthalmologists. By leveraging large pre-trained language models, we can design effective dialogues for specific scenarios, aiding in consultations. Traditional fine-tuning strategies for question-answering tasks are impractical due to increasing model size and often ignoring patient-doctor role function during consultations. In this paper, we propose EyeDoctor, an ophthalmic medical questioning large language model that enhances accuracy through doctor-patient role perception guided and an augmented knowledge base with external disease information. Experimental results show EyeDoctor achieves higher question-answering precision in ophthalmology consultations. Notably, EyeDoctor demonstrated a 7.25% improvement in Rouge-1 scores and a 10.16% improvement in F1 scores on multi-round datasets compared to second best model ChatGPT, highlighting the importance of doctor-patient role differentiation and dynamic knowledge base expansion for intelligent medical consultations. EyeDoc also serves as a free available web based service and souce code is available at https://github.com/sperfu/EyeDoc.</description>

      <title>Can Editing LLMs Inject Harm?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge editing techniques have been increasingly adopted to efficiently correct the false or outdated knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs), due to the high cost of retraining from scratch. Meanwhile, one critical but under-explored question is: can knowledge editing be used to inject harm into LLMs? In this paper, we propose to reformulate knowledge editing as a new type of safety threat for LLMs, namely Editing Attack, and conduct a systematic investigation with a newly constructed dataset EditAttack. Specifically, we focus on two typical safety risks of Editing Attack including Misinformation Injection and Bias Injection. For the risk of misinformation injection, we first categorize it into commonsense misinformation injection and long-tail misinformation injection. Then, we find that editing attacks can inject both types of misinformation into LLMs, and the effectiveness is particularly high for commonsense misinformation injection. For the risk of bias injection, we discover that not only can biased sentences be injected into LLMs with high effectiveness, but also one single biased sentence injection can cause a bias increase in general outputs of LLMs, which are even highly irrelevant to the injected sentence, indicating a catastrophic impact on the overall fairness of LLMs. Then, we further illustrate the high stealthiness of editing attacks, measured by their impact on the general knowledge and reasoning capacities of LLMs, and show the hardness of defending editing attacks with empirical evidence. Our discoveries demonstrate the emerging misuse risks of knowledge editing techniques on compromising the safety alignment of LLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crime situations are race against time. An AI-assisted criminal investigation system, providing prompt but precise legal counsel is in need for police officers. We introduce LAPIS (Language Model Augmented Police Investigation System), an automated system that assists police officers to perform rational and legal investigative actions. We constructed a finetuning dataset and retrieval knowledgebase specialized in crime investigation legal reasoning task. We extended the dataset's quality by incorporating manual curation efforts done by a group of domain experts. We then finetuned the pretrained weights of a smaller Korean language model to the newly constructed dataset and integrated it with the crime investigation knowledgebase retrieval approach. Experimental results show LAPIS' potential in providing reliable legal guidance for police officers, even better than the proprietary GPT-4 model. Qualitative analysis on the rationales generated by LAPIS demonstrate the model's reasoning ability to leverage the premises and derive legally correct conclusions.</description>

      <title>A2SF: Accumulative Attention Scoring with Forgetting Factor for Token Pruning in Transformer Decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLM) based on transformers are facing memory bottleneck issues due to KV cache, especially in long sequence handling. Previous researches proposed KV cache compression techniques that identify insignificant tokens based on Accumulative Attention Scores and removes their items from KV cache, noting that only few tokens play an important role in attention operations. However, we have observed that the existing Accumulative Attention Score is not suitable for the transformer decoder structure. In the decoder model, the number of times the Attention Score accumulates varies depending on the order of token appearance due to the effect of masking, causing an uneven comparison between tokens. To solve this, we propose Accumulative Attention Score with Forgetting Factor (A2SF) technique, which introduces a Forgetting Factor in the Attention Score accumulation process. A2SF applies a penalty to the past Attention Score generated from old tokens by repeatedly multiplying the Forgetting Factor to the Attention Score over time. Therefore, older tokens receive a larger penalty, providing fairness among different ages of tokens. Through the fair comparison among tokens, we can more effectively select important tokens. We have verified the accuracy improvement through A2SF in the OPT and LLaMA models and A2SF improves the accuracy of LLaMA 2 by up to 7.8% and 5.1% on 1-shot and 0-shot.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Feedback Mechanism for Simultaneous Speech Translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in simultaneous speech translation (SST) focus on the decision policies that enable the use of offline-trained ST models for simultaneous inference. These decision policies not only control the quality-latency trade-off in SST but also mitigate the impact of unstable predictions on translation quality by delaying translation for more context or discarding these predictions through stable hypothesis detection. However, these policies often overlook the potential benefits of utilizing unstable predictions. We introduce the contrastive feedback mechanism (CFM) for SST, a novel method that leverages these unstable predictions as feedback to improve translation quality. CFM guides the system to eliminate undesired model behaviors from these predictions through a contrastive objective. The experiments on 3 state-of-the-art decision policies across 8 languages in the MuST-C v1.0 dataset show that CFM effectively improves the performance of SST.</description>

      <title>CompA: Addressing the Gap in Compositional Reasoning in Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08753v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental characteristic of audio is its compositional nature. Audio-language models (ALMs) trained using a contrastive approach (e.g., CLAP) that learns a shared representation between audio and language modalities have improved performance in many downstream applications, including zero-shot audio classification, audio retrieval, etc. However, the ability of these models to effectively perform compositional reasoning remains largely unexplored and necessitates additional research. In this paper, we propose CompA, a collection of two expert-annotated benchmarks with a majority of real-world audio samples, to evaluate compositional reasoning in ALMs. Our proposed CompA-order evaluates how well an ALM understands the order or occurrence of acoustic events in audio, and CompA-attribute evaluates attribute-binding of acoustic events. An instance from either benchmark consists of two audio-caption pairs, where both audios have the same acoustic events but with different compositions. An ALM is evaluated on how well it matches the right audio to the right caption. Using this benchmark, we first show that current ALMs perform only marginally better than random chance, thereby struggling with compositional reasoning. Next, we propose CompA-CLAP, where we fine-tune CLAP using a novel learning method to improve its compositional reasoning abilities. To train CompA-CLAP, we first propose improvements to contrastive training with composition-aware hard negatives, allowing for more focused training. Next, we propose a novel modular contrastive loss that helps the model learn fine-grained compositional understanding and overcomes the acute scarcity of openly available compositional audios. CompA-CLAP significantly improves over all our baseline models on the CompA benchmark, indicating its superior compositional reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Neural Retrievers are Biased Towards LLM-Generated Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the paradigm of information retrieval (IR) applications, especially in web search, by generating vast amounts of human-like texts on the Internet. As a result, IR systems in the LLM era are facing a new challenge: the indexed documents are now not only written by human beings but also automatically generated by the LLMs. How these LLM-generated documents influence the IR systems is a pressing and still unexplored question. In this work, we conduct a quantitative evaluation of IR models in scenarios where both human-written and LLM-generated texts are involved. Surprisingly, our findings indicate that neural retrieval models tend to rank LLM-generated documents higher. We refer to this category of biases in neural retrievers towards the LLM-generated content as the \textbf{source bias}. Moreover, we discover that this bias is not confined to the first-stage neural retrievers, but extends to the second-stage neural re-rankers. Then, in-depth analyses from the perspective of text compression indicate that LLM-generated texts exhibit more focused semantics with less noise, making it easier for neural retrieval models to semantic match. To mitigate the source bias, we also propose a plug-and-play debiased constraint for the optimization objective, and experimental results show its effectiveness. Finally, we discuss the potential severe concerns stemming from the observed source bias and hope our findings can serve as a critical wake-up call to the IR community and beyond. To facilitate future explorations of IR in the LLM era, the constructed two new benchmarks are available at https://github.com/KID-22/Source-Bias.</description>

      <title>Offline Training of Language Model Agents with Functions as Learnable Weights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11359v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researchers and practitioners have recently reframed powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents, enabling them to automate complex tasks largely via the use of specialized functions. To facilitate the development of LLM agents, we present a novel paradigm of training LLM agents without modifying the LLM weights, which is particularly useful when the LLMs are difficult or inaccessible for modifications. Inspired by how humans continuously forge tools to adapt to real-world tasks, rather than change our biological structure to fit a static set of tools, we propose to progressively forge agent's functions to better solve the downstream tasks instead of modifying the LLM weights. By treating the functions as learnable `agent parameters' and leveraging the fundamental idea of model training in artificial intelligence, we develop AgentOptimizer that employs the LLM to update agents' functions and devise an agent training algorithm with two strategies, roll-back, and early-stop, to streamline the training process. With extensive experiments, we showcase that the agent training paradigm could significantly improve the performance of representative LLM agents in various downstream tasks. We also study the behavior of the agent training regarding aspects like the learning curve and domain transferability.</description>

      <title>Human vs. Machine: Behavioral Differences Between Expert Humans and Language Models in Wargame Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To some, the advent of AI promises better decision-making and increased military effectiveness while reducing the influence of human error and emotions. However, there is still debate about how AI systems, especially large language models (LLMs) that can be applied to many tasks, behave compared to humans in high-stakes military decision-making scenarios with the potential for increased risks towards escalation and unnecessary conflicts. To test this potential and scrutinize the use of LLMs for such purposes, we use a new wargame experiment with 107 national security experts designed to examine crisis escalation in a fictional US-China scenario and compare the behavior of human player teams to LLM-simulated team responses in separate simulations. Here, we find that the LLM-simulated responses can be more aggressive and significantly affected by changes in the scenario. We show a considerable high-level agreement in the LLM and human responses and significant quantitative and qualitative differences in individual actions and strategic tendencies. These differences depend on intrinsic biases in LLMs regarding the appropriate level of violence following strategic instructions, the choice of LLM, and whether the LLMs are tasked to decide for a team of players directly or first to simulate dialog between a team of players. When simulating the dialog, the discussions lack quality and maintain a farcical harmony. The LLM simulations cannot account for human player characteristics, showing no significant difference even for extreme traits, such as "pacifist" or "aggressive sociopath." When probing behavioral consistency across individual moves of the simulation, the tested LLMs deviated from each other but generally showed somewhat consistent behavior. Our results motivate policymakers to be cautious before granting autonomy or following AI-based strategy recommendations.</description>

      <title>FrameQuant: Flexible Low-Bit Quantization for Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers are the backbone of powerful foundation models for many Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks. But their compute and memory/storage footprint is large, and so, serving such models is expensive often requiring high-end hardware. To mitigate this difficulty, Post-Training Quantization seeks to modify a pre-trained model and quantize it to eight bits or lower, significantly boosting compute/memory/latency efficiency. Such models have been successfully quantized to four bits with some performance loss. In this work, we outline a simple scheme to quantize Transformer-based models to just two bits (plus some overhead) with only a small drop in accuracy. Key to our formulation is a concept borrowed from Harmonic analysis called Fusion Frames. Our main finding is that the quantization must take place not in the original weight space, but instead in the Fusion Frame representations. If quantization is interpreted as the addition of noise, our casting of the problem allows invoking an extensive body of known consistent recovery and noise robustness guarantees. Further, if desired, de-noising filters are known in closed form. We show empirically, via a variety of experiments, that (almost) two-bit quantization for Transformer models promises sizable efficiency gains.

      <title>Enhancing and Assessing Instruction-Following with Fine-Grained Instruction Variants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with precise instructions is essential for their application in diverse real-world scenarios. Current methods focus on enhancing the diversity and complexity of training and evaluation samples, yet they fall short in accurately assessing LLMs' ability to follow similar instruction variants. We introduce an effective data augmentation technique that decomposes complex instructions into simpler sub-components, modifies these, and reconstructs them into new variants, thereby preserves the original instruction's context and complexity while introducing variability, which is critical for training and evaluating LLMs' instruction-following precision. We developed the DeMoRecon dataset using this method to both fine-tune and evaluate LLMs. Our findings show that LLMs fine-tuned with DeMoRecon will gain significant performance boost on both ours and commonly used instructions-following benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Investigating and Mitigating the Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Though advanced in understanding visual information with human languages, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer from multimodal hallucinations. A natural concern is that during multimodal interaction, the generated hallucinations could influence the LVLMs' subsequent generation. Thus, we raise a question: When presented with a query relevant to the previously generated hallucination, will LVLMs be misled and respond incorrectly, even though the ground visual information exists? To answer this, we propose a framework called MMHalSnowball to evaluate LVLMs' behaviors when encountering generated hallucinations, where LVLMs are required to answer specific visual questions within a curated hallucinatory conversation. Crucially, our experiment shows that the performance of open-source LVLMs drops by at least $31\%$, indicating that LVLMs are prone to accept the generated hallucinations and make false claims that they would not have supported without distractions. We term this phenomenon Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing. To mitigate this, we further propose a training-free method called Residual Visual Decoding, where we revise the output distribution of LVLMs with the one derived from the residual visual input, providing models with direct access to the visual information. Experiments show that our method can mitigate more than $24\%$ of the snowballed multimodal hallucination while maintaining capabilities.</description>

      <title>Empirical Capacity Model for Self-Attention Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large pretrained self-attention neural networks, or transformers, have been very successful in various tasks recently. The performance of a model on a given task depends on its ability to memorize and generalize the training data. Large transformer models, which may have billions of parameters, in theory have a huge capacity to memorize content. However, the current algorithms for the optimization fall short of the theoretical capacity, and the capacity is also highly dependent on the content. In this paper, we focus on the memory capacity of these models obtained using common training algorithms and synthetic training data. Based on the results, we derive an empirical capacity model (ECM) for a generic transformer. The ECM can be used to design task-specific transformer models with an optimal number of parameters in cases where the target memorization capability of the task can be defined.</description>

      <title>Figure it Out: Analyzing-based Jailbreak Attack on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought remarkable generative capabilities across diverse tasks. However, despite the impressive achievements, these models still have numerous security vulnerabilities, particularly when faced with jailbreak attacks. Therefore, by investigating jailbreak attacks, we can uncover hidden weaknesses in LLMs and guide us in developing more robust defense mechanisms to fortify their security. In this paper, we further explore the boundary of jailbreak attacks on LLMs and propose Analyzing-based Jailbreak (ABJ). This effective jailbreak attack method takes advantage of LLMs' growing analyzing and reasoning capability and reveals their underlying vulnerabilities when facing analysis-based tasks. We conduct a detailed evaluation of ABJ across various open-source and closed-source LLMs, which achieves 94.8% Attack Success Rate (ASR) and 1.06 Attack Efficiency (AE) on GPT-4-turbo-0409, demonstrating state-of-the-art attack effectiveness and efficiency. Our research highlights the importance of prioritizing and enhancing the safety of LLMs to mitigate the risks of misuse.The code is publicly available at https://github.com/theshi-1128/ABJ-Attack.</description>

Abstract: Implicit bias can impede patient-provider interactions and lead to inequities in care. Raising awareness is key to reducing such bias, but its manifestations in the social dynamics of patient-provider communication are difficult to detect. In this study, we used automated speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP) to identify social signals in patient-provider interactions. We built an automated pipeline to predict social signals from audio recordings of 782 primary care visits that achieved 90.1% average accuracy across codes, and exhibited fairness in its predictions for white and non-white patients. Applying this pipeline, we identified statistically significant differences in provider communication behavior toward white versus non-white patients. In particular, providers expressed more patient-centered behaviors towards white patients including more warmth, engagement, and attentiveness. Our study underscores the potential of automated tools in identifying subtle communication signals that may be linked with bias and impact healthcare quality and equity.</description>

      <title>Explainable Natural Language Processing for Corporate Sustainability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sustainability commonly refers to entities, such as individuals, companies, and institutions, having a non-detrimental (or even positive) impact on the environment, society, and the economy. With sustainability becoming a synonym of acceptable and legitimate behaviour, it is being increasingly demanded and regulated. Several frameworks and standards have been proposed to measure the sustainability impact of corporations, including United Nations' sustainable development goals and the recently introduced global sustainability reporting framework, amongst others. However, the concept of corporate sustainability is complex due to the diverse and intricate nature of firm operations (i.e. geography, size, business activities, interlinks with other stakeholders). As a result, corporate sustainability assessments are plagued by subjectivity both within data that reflect corporate sustainability efforts (i.e. corporate sustainability disclosures) and the analysts evaluating them. This subjectivity can be distilled into distinct challenges, such as incompleteness, ambiguity, unreliability and sophistication on the data dimension, as well as limited resources and potential bias on the analyst dimension. Put together, subjectivity hinders effective cost attribution to entities non-compliant with prevailing sustainability expectations, potentially rendering sustainability efforts and its associated regulations futile. To this end, we argue that Explainable Natural Language Processing (XNLP) can significantly enhance corporate sustainability analysis. Specifically, linguistic understanding algorithms (lexical, semantic, syntactic), integrated with XAI capabilities (interpretability, explainability, faithfulness), can bridge gaps in analyst resources and mitigate subjectivity problems within data.</description>
