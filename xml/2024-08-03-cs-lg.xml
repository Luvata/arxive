      <title>On the Perturbed States for Transformed Input-robust Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents demonstrating proficiency in a training environment exhibit vulnerability to adversarial perturbations in input observations during deployment. This underscores the importance of building a robust agent before its real-world deployment. To alleviate the challenging point, prior works focus on developing robust training-based procedures, encompassing efforts to fortify the deep neural network component's robustness or subject the agent to adversarial training against potent attacks. In this work, we propose a novel method referred to as \textit{Transformed Input-robust RL (TIRL)}, which explores another avenue to mitigate the impact of adversaries by employing input transformation-based defenses. Specifically, we introduce two principles for applying transformation-based defenses in learning robust RL agents: \textit{(1) autoencoder-styled denoising} to reconstruct the original state and \textit{(2) bounded transformations (bit-depth reduction and vector quantization (VQ))} to achieve close transformed inputs. The transformations are applied to the state before feeding it into the policy network. Extensive experiments on multiple \mujoco environments demonstrate that input transformation-based defenses, \ie, VQ, defend against several adversaries in the state observations.</description>

      <title>Temporal Subspace Clustering for Molecular Dynamics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MOSCITO (MOlecular Dynamics Subspace Clustering with Temporal Observance), a subspace clustering for molecular dynamics data. MOSCITO groups those timesteps of a molecular dynamics trajectory together into clusters in which the molecule has similar conformations. In contrast to state-of-the-art methods, MOSCITO takes advantage of sequential relationships found in time series data. Unlike existing work, MOSCITO does not need a two-step procedure with tedious post-processing, but directly models essential properties of the data. Interpreting clusters as Markov states allows us to evaluate the clustering performance based on the resulting Markov state models. In experiments on 60 trajectories and 4 different proteins, we show that the performance of MOSCITO achieves state-of-the-art performance in a novel single-step method. Moreover, by modeling temporal aspects, MOSCITO obtains better segmentation of trajectories, especially for small numbers of clusters.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Transit Signal Priority based on Deep Reinforcement Learning and Connected Vehicles in a Traffic Microsimulation Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model free reinforcement learning (RL) provides a potential alternative to earlier formulations of adaptive transit signal priority (TSP) algorithms based on mathematical programming that require complex and nonlinear objective functions. This study extends RL - based traffic control to include TSP. Using a microscopic simulation environment and connected vehicle data, the study develops and tests a TSP event-based RL agent that assumes control from another developed RL - based general traffic signal controller. The TSP agent assumes control when transit buses enter the dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) zone of the intersection. This agent is shown to reduce the bus travel time by about 21%, with marginal impacts to general traffic at a saturation rate of 0.95. The TSP agent also shows slightly better bus travel time compared to actuated signal control with TSP. The architecture of the agent and simulation is selected considering the need to improve simulation run time efficiency.</description>

      <title>Measuring Progress in Dictionary Learning for Language Model Interpretability with Board Game Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What latent features are encoded in language model (LM) representations? Recent work on training sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle interpretable features in LM representations has shown significant promise. However, evaluating the quality of these SAEs is difficult because we lack a ground-truth collection of interpretable features that we expect good SAEs to recover. We thus propose to measure progress in interpretable dictionary learning by working in the setting of LMs trained on chess and Othello transcripts. These settings carry natural collections of interpretable features -- for example, "there is a knight on F3" -- which we leverage into $\textit{supervised}$ metrics for SAE quality. To guide progress in interpretable dictionary learning, we introduce a new SAE training technique, $\textit{p-annealing}$, which improves performance on prior unsupervised metrics as well as our new metrics.</description>

      <title>Generative Learning of the Solution of Parametric Partial Differential Equations Using Guided Diffusion Models and Virtual Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a generative learning framework to model high-dimensional parametric systems using gradient guidance and virtual observations. We consider systems described by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) discretized with structured or unstructured grids. The framework integrates multi-level information to generate high fidelity time sequences of the system dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our framework with two case studies in incompressible, two dimensional, low Reynolds cylinder flow on an unstructured mesh and incompressible turbulent channel flow on a structured mesh, both parameterized by the Reynolds number. Our results illustrate the framework's robustness and ability to generate accurate flow sequences across various parameter settings, significantly reducing computational costs allowing for efficient forecasting and reconstruction of flow dynamics.</description>

      <title>Non-convolutional Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rethink convolution-based graph neural networks (GNN) -- they characteristically suffer from limited expressiveness, over-smoothing, and over-squashing, and require specialized sparse kernels for efficient computation. Here, we design a simple graph learning module entirely free of convolution operators, coined \textit{random walk with unifying memory} (RUM) neural network, where an RNN merges the topological and semantic graph features along the random walks terminating at each node. Relating the rich literature on RNN behavior and graph topology, we theoretically show and experimentally verify that RUM attenuates the aforementioned symptoms and is more expressive than the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) isomorphism test. On a variety of node- and graph-level classification and regression tasks, RUM not only achieves competitive performance, but is also robust, memory-efficient, scalable, and faster than the simplest convolutional GNNs.</description>

      <title>UnPaSt: unsupervised patient stratification by differentially expressed biclusters in omics data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most complex diseases, including cancer and non-malignant diseases like asthma, have distinct molecular subtypes that require distinct clinical approaches. However, existing computational patient stratification methods have been benchmarked almost exclusively on cancer omics data and only perform well when mutually exclusive subtypes can be characterized by many biomarkers. Here, we contribute with a massive evaluation attempt, quantitatively exploring the power of 22 unsupervised patient stratification methods using both, simulated and real transcriptome data. From this experience, we developed UnPaSt (https://apps.cosy.bio/unpast/) optimizing unsupervised patient stratification, working even with only a limited number of subtype-predictive biomarkers. We evaluated all 23 methods on real-world breast cancer and asthma transcriptomics data. Although many methods reliably detected major breast cancer subtypes, only few identified Th2-high asthma, and UnPaSt significantly outperformed its closest competitors in both test datasets. Essentially, we showed that UnPaSt can detect many biologically insightful and reproducible patterns in omic datasets.</description>

      <title>Penzai + Treescope: A Toolkit for Interpreting, Visualizing, and Editing Models As Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much of today's machine learning research involves interpreting, modifying or visualizing models after they are trained. I present Penzai, a neural network library designed to simplify model manipulation by representing models as simple data structures, and Treescope, an interactive pretty-printer and array visualizer that can visualize both model inputs/outputs and the models themselves. Penzai models are built using declarative combinators that expose the model forward pass in the structure of the model object itself, and use named axes to ensure each operation is semantically meaningful. With Penzai's tree-editing selector system, users can both insert and replace model components, allowing them to intervene on intermediate values or make other edits to the model structure. Users can then get immediate feedback by visualizing the modified model with Treescope. I describe the motivation and main features of Penzai and Treescope, and discuss how treating the model as data enables a variety of analyses and interventions to be implemented as data-structure transformations, without requiring model designers to add explicit hooks.</description>

      <title>Load Balancing in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning framework that enables learning from data distributed across multiple remote devices, enhancing communication efficiency and data privacy. Due to limited communication resources, a scheduling policy is often applied to select a subset of devices for participation in each FL round. The scheduling process confronts significant challenges due to the need for fair workload distribution, efficient resource utilization, scalability in environments with numerous edge devices, and statistically heterogeneous data across devices. This paper proposes a load metric for scheduling policies based on the Age of Information and addresses the above challenges by minimizing the load metric variance across the clients. Furthermore, a decentralized Markov scheduling policy is presented, that ensures a balanced workload distribution while eliminating the management overhead irrespective of the network size due to independent client decision-making. We establish the optimal parameters of the Markov chain model and validate our approach through simulations. The results demonstrate that reducing the load metric variance not only promotes fairness and improves operational efficiency, but also enhances the convergence rate of the learning models.</description>

      <title>Discovering Car-following Dynamics from Trajectory Data through Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to discover the governing mathematical expressions of car-following dynamics from trajectory data directly using deep learning techniques. We propose an expression exploration framework based on deep symbolic regression (DSR) integrated with a variable intersection selection (VIS) method to find variable combinations that encourage interpretable and parsimonious mathematical expressions. In the exploration learning process, two penalty terms are added to improve the reward function: (i) a complexity penalty to regulate the complexity of the explored expressions to be parsimonious, and (ii) a variable interaction penalty to encourage the expression exploration to focus on variable combinations that can best describe the data. We show the performance of the proposed method to learn several car-following dynamics models and discuss its limitations and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Mobility-Aware Federated Self-supervised Learning in Vehicular Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an advanced distributed machine learning approach, that protects the privacy of each vehicle by allowing the model to be trained on multiple devices simultaneously without the need to upload all data to a road side unit (RSU). This enables FL to handle scenarios with sensitive or widely distributed data. However, in these fields, it is well known that the labeling costs can be a significant expense, and models relying on labels are not suitable for these rapidly evolving fields especially in vehicular networks, or mobile internet of things (MIoT), where new data emerges constantly. To handle this issue, the self-supervised learning paves the way for training without labels. Additionally, for vehicles with high velocity, owing to blurred images, simple aggregation not only impacts the accuracy of the aggregated model but also reduces the convergence speed of FL. This paper proposes a FL algorithm based on image blur level to aggregation, called FLSimCo, which does not require labels and serves as a pre-training stage for self-supervised learning in the vehicular environment. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits fast and stable convergence.</description>

      <title>High Performance Im2win and Direct Convolutions using Three Tensor Layouts on SIMD Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolution is the core component within deep neural networks and it is computationally intensive and time consuming. Tensor data layouts significantly impact convolution operations in terms of memory access and computational efficiency. Yet, there is still a lack of comprehensive performance characterization on data layouts on SIMD architectures concerning convolution methods. This paper proposes three novel data layouts for im2win convolution: NHWC, CHWN, and CHWN8, and introduces a set of general optimization techniques for both direct and im2win convolutions. We compare the optimized im2win convolution with the direct convolution and PyTorch's im2col-based convolution across the aforementioned layouts on SIMD machines. The experiments demonstrated that the im2win convolution with the new NHWC layout achieved up to 355% performance speedup over NCHW layout. Our optimizations also significantly improve the performance of both im2win and direct convolutions. Our optimized im2win and direct convolutions achieved up to 95% and 94% of machine's theoretical peak performance, respectively.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Graph Representation Learning with Adversarial Cross-view Reconstruction and Information Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received extensive research attention due to their powerful information aggregation capabilities. Despite the success of GNNs, most of them suffer from the popularity bias issue in a graph caused by a small number of popular categories. Additionally, real graph datasets always contain incorrect node labels, which hinders GNNs from learning effective node representations. Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been shown to be effective in solving the above problems for node classification tasks. Most existing GCL methods are implemented by randomly removing edges and nodes to create multiple contrasting views, and then maximizing the mutual information (MI) between these contrasting views to improve the node feature representation. However, maximizing the mutual information between multiple contrasting views may lead the model to learn some redundant information irrelevant to the node classification task. To tackle this issue, we propose an effective Contrastive Graph Representation Learning with Adversarial Cross-view Reconstruction and Information Bottleneck (CGRL) for node classification, which can adaptively learn to mask the nodes and edges in the graph to obtain the optimal graph structure representation. Furthermore, we innovatively introduce the information bottleneck theory into GCLs to remove redundant information in multiple contrasting views while retaining as much information as possible about node classification. Moreover, we add noise perturbations to the original views and reconstruct the augmented views by constructing adversarial views to improve the robustness of node feature representation. Extensive experiments on real-world public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains an unsolved problem. Human preferences are highly distributed and can be captured at multiple levels of abstraction, from the individual to diverse populations. Organisational preferences, represented by standards and principles, are defined to mitigate reputational risk or meet legislative obligations. In this paper, we present ABC Align, a novel alignment methodology for LLMs that enables integration of the standards and preferences of a large media organisation into the LLM itself. We combine a set of data and methods that build on recent breakthroughs in synthetic data generation, preference optimisation, and post-training model quantisation. Our unified approach mitigates bias and improves accuracy, while preserving reasoning capability, as measured against standard benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Discretizing Continuous Action Space with Unimodal Probability Distributions for On-Policy Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For on-policy reinforcement learning, discretizing action space for continuous control can easily express multiple modes and is straightforward to optimize. However, without considering the inherent ordering between the discrete atomic actions, the explosion in the number of discrete actions can possess undesired properties and induce a higher variance for the policy gradient estimator. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward architecture that addresses this issue by constraining the discrete policy to be unimodal using Poisson probability distributions. This unimodal architecture can better leverage the continuity in the underlying continuous action space using explicit unimodal probability distributions. We conduct extensive experiments to show that the discrete policy with the unimodal probability distribution provides significantly faster convergence and higher performance for on-policy reinforcement learning algorithms in challenging control tasks, especially in highly complex tasks such as Humanoid. We provide theoretical analysis on the variance of the policy gradient estimator, which suggests that our attentively designed unimodal discrete policy can retain a lower variance and yield a stable learning process.</description>

      <title>Online Linear Programming with Batching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Online Linear Programming (OLP) with batching. The planning horizon is cut into $K$ batches, and the decisions on customers arriving within a batch can be delayed to the end of their associated batch. Compared with OLP without batching, the ability to delay decisions brings better operational performance, as measured by regret. Two research questions of interest are: (1) What is a lower bound of the regret as a function of $K$? (2) What algorithms can achieve the regret lower bound? These questions have been analyzed in the literature when the distribution of the reward and the resource consumption of the customers have finite support. By contrast, this paper analyzes these questions when the conditional distribution of the reward given the resource consumption is continuous, and we show the answers are different under this setting. When there is only a single type of resource and the decision maker knows the total number of customers, we propose an algorithm with a $O(\log K)$ regret upper bound and provide a $\Omega(\log K)$ regret lower bound. We also propose algorithms with $O(\log K)$ regret upper bound for the setting in which there are multiple types of resource and the setting in which customers arrive following a Poisson process. All these regret upper and lower bounds are independent of the length of the planning horizon, and all the proposed algorithms delay decisions on customers arriving in only the first and the last batch. We also take customer impatience into consideration and establish a way of selecting an appropriate batch size.</description>

      <title>ADBM: Adversarial diffusion bridge model for reliable adversarial purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Diffusion-based Purification (DiffPure) has been recognized as an effective defense method against adversarial examples. However, we find DiffPure which directly employs the original pre-trained diffusion models for adversarial purification, to be suboptimal. This is due to an inherent trade-off between noise purification performance and data recovery quality. Additionally, the reliability of existing evaluations for DiffPure is questionable, as they rely on weak adaptive attacks. In this work, we propose a novel Adversarial Diffusion Bridge Model, termed ADBM. ADBM directly constructs a reverse bridge from the diffused adversarial data back to its original clean examples, enhancing the purification capabilities of the original diffusion models. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation across various scenarios, ADBM has proven to be a superior and robust defense mechanism, offering significant promise for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Preferences in Loss Functions for Sequential Recommendation via Weak Transitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A choice of optimization objective is immensely pivotal in the design of a recommender system as it affects the general modeling process of a user's intent from previous interactions. Existing approaches mainly adhere to three categories of loss functions: pairwise, pointwise, and setwise loss functions. Despite their effectiveness, a critical and common drawback of such objectives is viewing the next observed item as a unique positive while considering all remaining items equally negative. Such a binary label assignment is generally limited to assuring a higher recommendation score of the positive item, neglecting potential structures induced by varying preferences between other unobserved items. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel method that extends original objectives to explicitly leverage the different levels of preferences as relative orders between their scores. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to baseline objectives.</description>

      <title>OTAD: An Optimal Transport-Induced Robust Model for Agnostic Adversarial Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations of the inputs, posing a significant challenge to their reliability and robustness. Empirical methods such as adversarial training can defend against particular attacks but remain vulnerable to more powerful attacks. Alternatively, Lipschitz networks provide certified robustness to unseen perturbations but lack sufficient expressive power. To harness the advantages of both approaches, we design a novel two-step Optimal Transport induced Adversarial Defense (OTAD) model that can fit the training data accurately while preserving the local Lipschitz continuity. First, we train a DNN with a regularizer derived from optimal transport theory, yielding a discrete optimal transport map linking data to its features. By leveraging the map's inherent regularity, we interpolate the map by solving the convex integration problem (CIP) to guarantee the local Lipschitz property. OTAD is extensible to diverse architectures of ResNet and Transformer, making it suitable for complex data. For efficient computation, the CIP can be solved through training neural networks. OTAD opens a novel avenue for developing reliable and secure deep learning systems through the regularity of optimal transport maps. Empirical results demonstrate that OTAD can outperform other robust models on diverse datasets.</description>

      <title>"Patriarchy Hurts Men Too." Does Your Model Agree? A Discussion on Fairness Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pipeline of a fair ML practitioner is generally divided into three phases: 1) Selecting a fairness measure. 2) Choosing a model that minimizes this measure. 3) Maximizing the model's performance on the data. In the context of group fairness, this approach often obscures implicit assumptions about how bias is introduced into the data. For instance, in binary classification, it is often assumed that the best model, with equal fairness, is the one with better performance. However, this belief already imposes specific properties on the process that introduced bias. More precisely, we are already assuming that the biasing process is a monotonic function of the fair scores, dependent solely on the sensitive attribute. We formally prove this claim regarding several implicit fairness assumptions. This leads, in our view, to two possible conclusions: either the behavior of the biasing process is more complex than mere monotonicity, which means we need to identify and reject our implicit assumptions in order to develop models capable of tackling more complex situations; or the bias introduced in the data behaves predictably, implying that many of the developed models are superfluous.</description>

      <title>Neural Graph Matching for Video Retrieval in Large-Scale Video-driven E-commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of the short video industry, traditional e-commerce has encountered a new paradigm, video-driven e-commerce, which leverages attractive videos for product showcases and provides both video and item services for users. Benefitting from the dynamic and visualized introduction of items,video-driven e-commerce has shown huge potential in stimulating consumer confidence and promoting sales. In this paper, we focus on the video retrieval task, facing the following challenges: (1) Howto handle the heterogeneities among users, items, and videos? (2)How to mine the complementarity between items and videos for better user understanding? In this paper, we first leverage the dual graph to model the co-existing of user-video and user-item interactions in video-driven e-commerce and innovatively reduce user preference understanding to a graph matching problem. To solve it, we further propose a novel bi-level Graph Matching Network(GMN), which mainly consists of node- and preference-level graph matching. Given a user, node-level graph matching aims to match videos and items, while preference-level graph matching aims to match multiple user preferences extracted from both videos and items. Then the proposed GMN can generate and improve user embedding by aggregating matched nodes or preferences from the dual graph in a bi-level manner. Comprehensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed GMN with significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., AUC+1.9% and CTR+7.15%). We have developed it on a well-known video-driven e-commerce platform, serving hundreds of millions of users every day</description>

      <title>Memorization Capacity for Additive Fine-Tuning with Small ReLU Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large pre-trained models is a common practice in machine learning applications, yet its mathematical analysis remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we study fine-tuning through the lens of memorization capacity. Our new measure, the Fine-Tuning Capacity (FTC), is defined as the maximum number of samples a neural network can fine-tune, or equivalently, as the minimum number of neurons ($m$) needed to arbitrarily change $N$ labels among $K$ samples considered in the fine-tuning process. In essence, FTC extends the memorization capacity concept to the fine-tuning scenario. We analyze FTC for the additive fine-tuning scenario where the fine-tuned network is defined as the summation of the frozen pre-trained network $f$ and a neural network $g$ (with $m$ neurons) designed for fine-tuning. When $g$ is a ReLU network with either 2 or 3 layers, we obtain tight upper and lower bounds on FTC; we show that $N$ samples can be fine-tuned with $m=\Theta(N)$ neurons for 2-layer networks, and with $m=\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ neurons for 3-layer networks, no matter how large $K$ is. Our results recover the known memorization capacity results when $N = K$ as a special case.</description>

      <title>On the Limitations and Prospects of Machine Unlearning for Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI), which aims to synthesize realistic and diverse data samples from latent variables or other data modalities, has achieved remarkable results in various domains, such as natural language, images, audio, and graphs. However, they also pose challenges and risks to data privacy, security, and ethics. Machine unlearning is the process of removing or weakening the influence of specific data samples or features from a trained model, without affecting its performance on other data or tasks. While machine unlearning has shown significant efficacy in traditional machine learning tasks, it is still unclear if it could help GenAI become safer and aligned with human desire. To this end, this position paper provides an in-depth discussion of the machine unlearning approaches for GenAI. Firstly, we formulate the problem of machine unlearning tasks on GenAI and introduce the background. Subsequently, we systematically examine the limitations of machine unlearning on GenAI models by focusing on the two representative branches: LLMs and image generative (diffusion) models. Finally, we provide our prospects mainly from three aspects: benchmark, evaluation metrics, and utility-unlearning trade-off, and conscientiously advocate for the future development of this field.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Whole Slide Pathology Foundation Models through Stain Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in digital pathology have led to the development of numerous foundational models that utilize self-supervised learning on patches extracted from gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs). While this approach leverages vast amounts of unlabeled data, we have discovered a significant issue: features extracted from these self-supervised models tend to cluster by individual WSIs, a phenomenon we term WSI-specific feature collapse. This problem can potentially limit the model's generalization ability and performance on various downstream tasks. To address this issue, we introduce Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model, a novel foundational model trained on patches that have undergone stain normalization. Stain normalization helps reduce color variability arising from different laboratories and scanners, enabling the model to learn more consistent features. Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model is trained using 285,153,903 patches extracted from a total of 34,795 WSIs, combining data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Our experiments demonstrate that Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model significantly mitigates the feature collapse problem, indicating that the model has learned more generalized features rather than overfitting to individual WSI characteristics. We compared Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model with state-of-the-art models across six downstream task datasets, and our results show that \name{} achieves excellent performance relative to the number of WSIs used and the model's parameter count. This suggests that the application of stain normalization has substantially improved the model's efficiency and generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>What comes after transformers? -- A selective survey connecting ideas in deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have become the de-facto standard model in artificial intelligence since 2017 despite numerous shortcomings ranging from energy inefficiency to hallucinations. Research has made a lot of progress in improving elements of transformers, and, more generally, deep learning manifesting in many proposals for architectures, layers, optimization objectives, and optimization techniques. For researchers it is difficult to keep track of such developments on a broader level. We provide a comprehensive overview of the many important, recent works in these areas to those who already have a basic understanding of deep learning. Our focus differs from other works, as we target specifically novel, alternative potentially disruptive approaches to transformers as well as successful ideas of recent deep learning. We hope that such a holistic and unified treatment of influential, recent works and novel ideas helps researchers to form new connections between diverse areas of deep learning. We identify and discuss multiple patterns that summarize the key strategies for successful innovations over the last decade as well as works that can be seen as rising stars. Especially, we discuss attempts on how to improve on transformers covering (partially) proven methods such as state space models but also including far-out ideas in deep learning that seem promising despite not achieving state-of-the-art results. We also cover a discussion on recent state-of-the-art models such as OpenAI's GPT series and Meta's LLama models and, Google's Gemini model family.</description>

      <title>Towards Evolutionary-based Automated Machine Learning for Small Molecule Pharmacokinetic Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is revolutionising drug discovery by expediting the prediction of small molecule properties essential for developing new drugs. These properties -- including absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME)-- are crucial in the early stages of drug development since they provide an understanding of the course of the drug in the organism, i.e., the drug's pharmacokinetics. However, existing methods lack personalisation and rely on manually crafted ML algorithms or pipelines, which can introduce inefficiencies and biases into the process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel evolutionary-based automated ML method (AutoML) specifically designed for predicting small molecule properties, with a particular focus on pharmacokinetics. Leveraging the advantages of grammar-based genetic programming, our AutoML method streamlines the process by automatically selecting algorithms and designing predictive pipelines tailored to the particular characteristics of input molecular data. Results demonstrate AutoML's effectiveness in selecting diverse ML algorithms, resulting in comparable or even improved predictive performances compared to conventional approaches. By offering personalised ML-driven pipelines, our method promises to enhance small molecule research in drug discovery, providing researchers with a valuable tool for accelerating the development of novel therapeutic drugs.</description>

      <title>A Cross-Domain Benchmark for Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Learning (AL) deals with identifying the most informative samples for labeling to reduce data annotation costs for supervised learning tasks. AL research suffers from the fact that lifts from literature generalize poorly and that only a small number of repetitions of experiments are conducted. To overcome these obstacles, we propose \emph{CDALBench}, the first active learning benchmark which includes tasks in computer vision, natural language processing and tabular learning. Furthermore, by providing an efficient, greedy oracle, \emph{CDALBench} can be evaluated with 50 runs for each experiment. We show, that both the cross-domain character and a large amount of repetitions are crucial for sophisticated evaluation of AL research. Concretely, we show that the superiority of specific methods varies over the different domains, making it important to evaluate Active Learning with a cross-domain benchmark. Additionally, we show that having a large amount of runs is crucial. With only conducting three runs as often done in the literature, the superiority of specific methods can strongly vary with the specific runs. This effect is so strong, that, depending on the seed, even a well-established method's performance can be significantly better and significantly worse than random for the same dataset.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review on Long-Tailed Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-tailed data is a special type of multi-class imbalanced data with a very large amount of minority/tail classes that have a very significant combined influence. Long-tailed learning aims to build high-performance models on datasets with long-tailed distributions, which can identify all the classes with high accuracy, in particular the minority/tail classes. It is a cutting-edge research direction that has attracted a remarkable amount of research effort in the past few years. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of latest advances in long-tailed visual learning. We first propose a new taxonomy for long-tailed learning, which consists of eight different dimensions, including data balancing, neural architecture, feature enrichment, logits adjustment, loss function, bells and whistles, network optimization, and post hoc processing techniques. Based on our proposed taxonomy, we present a systematic review of long-tailed learning methods, discussing their commonalities and alignable differences. We also analyze the differences between imbalance learning and long-tailed learning approaches. Finally, we discuss prospects and future directions in this field.</description>

      <title>Graph Representation Learning via Causal Diffusion for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based recommendation algorithms typically assume that training and testing data are drawn from independent and identically distributed (IID) spaces. However, this assumption often fails in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, resulting in significant performance degradation. In this study, we construct a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to analyze interaction data, revealing that environmental confounders (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) lead to unstable correlations in GNN-based models, thus impairing their generalization to OOD data. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, graph representation learning via causal diffusion (CausalDiffRec) for OOD recommendation. This method enhances the model's generalization on OOD data by eliminating environmental confounding factors and learning invariant graph representations. Specifically, we use backdoor adjustment and variational inference to infer the real environmental distribution, thereby eliminating the impact of environmental confounders. This inferred distribution is then used as prior knowledge to guide the representation learning in the reverse phase of the diffusion process to learn the invariant representation. In addition, we provide a theoretical derivation that proves optimizing the objective function of CausalDiffRec can encourage the model to learn environment-invariant graph representations, thereby achieving excellent generalization performance in recommendations under distribution shifts. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CausalDiffRec in improving the generalization of OOD data, and the average improvement is up to 10.69% on Food, 18.83% on KuaiRec, 22.41% on Yelp2018, and 11.65% on Douban datasets.</description>

      <title>Block-Operations: Using Modular Routing to Improve Compositional Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the hypothesis that poor compositional generalization in neural networks is caused by difficulties with learning effective routing. To solve this problem, we propose the concept of block-operations, which is based on splitting all activation tensors in the network into uniformly sized blocks and using an inductive bias to encourage modular routing and modification of these blocks. Based on this concept we introduce the Multiplexer, a new architectural component that enhances the Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN). We experimentally confirm that Multiplexers exhibit strong compositional generalization. On both a synthetic and a realistic task our model was able to learn the underlying process behind the task, whereas both FNNs and Transformers were only able to learn heuristic approximations. We propose as future work to use the principles of block-operations to improve other existing architectures.</description>

      <title>VecAug: Unveiling Camouflaged Frauds with Cohort Augmentation for Enhanced Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fraud detection presents a challenging task characterized by ever-evolving fraud patterns and scarce labeled data. Existing methods predominantly rely on graph-based or sequence-based approaches. While graph-based approaches connect users through shared entities to capture structural information, they remain vulnerable to fraudsters who can disrupt or manipulate these connections. In contrast, sequence-based approaches analyze users' behavioral patterns, offering robustness against tampering but overlooking the interactions between similar users. Inspired by cohort analysis in retention and healthcare, this paper introduces VecAug, a novel cohort-augmented learning framework that addresses these challenges by enhancing the representation learning of target users with personalized cohort information. To this end, we first propose a vector burn-in technique for automatic cohort identification, which retrieves a task-specific cohort for each target user. Then, to fully exploit the cohort information, we introduce an attentive cohort aggregation technique for augmenting target user representations. To improve the robustness of such cohort augmentation, we also propose a novel label-aware cohort neighbor separation mechanism to distance negative cohort neighbors and calibrate the aggregated cohort information. By integrating this cohort information with target user representations, VecAug enhances the modeling capacity and generalization capabilities of the model to be augmented. Our framework is flexible and can be seamlessly integrated with existing fraud detection models. We deploy our framework on e-commerce platforms and evaluate it on three fraud detection datasets, and results show that VecAug improves the detection performance of base models by up to 2.48\% in AUC and 22.5\% in R@P$_{0.9}$, outperforming state-of-the-art methods significantly.</description>

Abstract: The advancements in smart sensors for Industry 4.0 offer ample opportunities for low-powered predictive maintenance and condition monitoring. However, traditional approaches in this field rely on processing in the cloud, which incurs high costs in energy and storage. This paper investigates the potential of neural networks for low-power on-device computation of vibration sensor data for predictive maintenance. We review the literature on Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Artificial Neuronal Networks (ANNs) for vibration-based predictive maintenance by analyzing datasets, data preprocessing, network architectures, and hardware implementations. Our findings suggest that no satisfactory standard benchmark dataset exists for evaluating neural networks in predictive maintenance tasks. Furthermore frequency domain transformations are commonly employed for preprocessing. SNNs mainly use shallow feed forward architectures, whereas ANNs explore a wider range of models and deeper networks. Finally, we highlight the need for future research on hardware implementations of neural networks for low-power predictive maintenance applications and the development of a standardized benchmark dataset.</description>

      <title>Hilbert curves for efficient exploratory landscape analysis neighbourhood sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landscape analysis aims to characterise optimisation problems based on their objective (or fitness) function landscape properties. The problem search space is typically sampled, and various landscape features are estimated based on the samples. One particularly salient set of features is information content, which requires the samples to be sequences of neighbouring solutions, such that the local relationships between consecutive sample points are preserved. Generating such spatially correlated samples that also provide good search space coverage is challenging. It is therefore common to first obtain an unordered sample with good search space coverage, and then apply an ordering algorithm such as the nearest neighbour to minimise the distance between consecutive points in the sample. However, the nearest neighbour algorithm becomes computationally prohibitive in higher dimensions, thus there is a need for more efficient alternatives. In this study, Hilbert space-filling curves are proposed as a method to efficiently obtain high-quality ordered samples. Hilbert curves are a special case of fractal curves, and guarantee uniform coverage of a bounded search space while providing a spatially correlated sample. We study the effectiveness of Hilbert curves as samplers, and discover that they are capable of extracting salient features at a fraction of the computational cost compared to Latin hypercube sampling with post-factum ordering. Further, we investigate the use of Hilbert curves as an ordering strategy, and find that they order the sample significantly faster than the nearest neighbour ordering, without sacrificing the saliency of the extracted features.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning with Dynamic Localized Repulsion for Brain Age Prediction on 3D Stiffness Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of neuroimaging, accurate brain age prediction is pivotal for uncovering the complexities of brain aging and pinpointing early indicators of neurodegenerative conditions. Recent advancements in self-supervised learning, particularly in contrastive learning, have demonstrated greater robustness when dealing with complex datasets. However, current approaches often fall short in generalizing across non-uniformly distributed data, prevalent in medical imaging scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel contrastive loss that adapts dynamically during the training process, focusing on the localized neighborhoods of samples. Moreover, we expand beyond traditional structural features by incorporating brain stiffness, a mechanical property previously underexplored yet promising due to its sensitivity to age-related changes. This work presents the first application of self-supervised learning to brain mechanical properties, using compiled stiffness maps from various clinical studies to predict brain age. Our approach, featuring dynamic localized loss, consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior performance and laying the way for new directions in brain aging research.</description>

      <title>ReSi: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Representational Similarity Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the similarity of different representations of neural architectures is a fundamental task and an open research challenge for the machine learning community. This paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating representational similarity measures based on well-defined groundings of similarity. The representational similarity (ReSi) benchmark consists of (i) six carefully designed tests for similarity measures, (ii) 23 similarity measures, (iii) eleven neural network architectures, and (iv) six datasets, spanning over the graph, language, and vision domains. The benchmark opens up several important avenues of research on representational similarity that enable novel explorations and applications of neural architectures. We demonstrate the utility of the ReSi benchmark by conducting experiments on various neural network architectures, real world datasets and similarity measures. All components of the benchmark are publicly available and thereby facilitate systematic reproduction and production of research results. The benchmark is extensible, future research can build on and further expand it. We believe that the ReSi benchmark can serve as a sound platform catalyzing future research that aims to systematically evaluate existing and explore novel ways of comparing representations of neural architectures.</description>

      <title>Learning to Embed Distributions via Maximum Kernel Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical data can often be considered as samples from a set of probability distributions. Kernel methods have emerged as a natural approach for learning to classify these distributions. Although numerous kernels between distributions have been proposed, applying kernel methods to distribution regression tasks remains challenging, primarily because selecting a suitable kernel is not straightforward. Surprisingly, the question of learning a data-dependent distribution kernel has received little attention. In this paper, we propose a novel objective for the unsupervised learning of data-dependent distribution kernel, based on the principle of entropy maximization in the space of probability measure embeddings. We examine the theoretical properties of the latent embedding space induced by our objective, demonstrating that its geometric structure is well-suited for solving downstream discriminative tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the learned kernel across different modalities.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Natural Gradient Descent for Over-parameterized Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order methods, such as gradient descent (GD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) have been proven effective in training neural networks. In the setting of over-parameterization, there is a line of work demonstrating that randomly initialized (stochastic) gradient descent converges to a globally optimal solution at a linear convergence rate for the quadratic loss function. However, the learning rate of GD in training two-layer neural networks has a poor dependence on the sample size and the Gram matrix, resulting in a slow training process. In this paper, we show that for the $L^2$ regression problems, the learning rate can be improved from $\mathcal{O}(\lambda_0/n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1/\|\bm{H}^{\infty}\|_2)$, which implies that GD enjoys a faster convergence rate. Moreover, we further generalize the method for GD in training two-layer Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), showing a similar improvement for the learning rate. Although the improved learning rate depends mildly on the Gram matrix, we still need to set it small enough in practice due to the agnostic eigenvalues of the Gram matrix. More importantly, the convergence rate relies on the least eigenvalue of the Gram matrix, leading to slow convergence. In this work, we provide the convergence analysis of natural gradient descent (NGD) in training two-layer PINNs. We show that the learning rate can be $\mathcal{O}(1)$ and at this time, the convergence rate is independent of the Gram matrix.</description>

      <title>AutoPV: Automatically Design Your Photovoltaic Power Forecasting Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photovoltaic power forecasting (PVPF) is a critical area in time series forecasting (TSF), enabling the efficient utilization of solar energy. With advancements in machine learning and deep learning, various models have been applied to PVPF tasks. However, constructing an optimal predictive architecture for specific PVPF tasks remains challenging, as it requires cross-domain knowledge and significant labor costs. To address this challenge, we introduce AutoPV, a novel framework for the automated search and construction of PVPF models based on neural architecture search (NAS) technology. We develop a brand new NAS search space that incorporates various data processing techniques from state-of-the-art (SOTA) TSF models and typical PVPF deep learning models. The effectiveness of AutoPV is evaluated on diverse PVPF tasks using a dataset from the Daqing Photovoltaic Station in China. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoPV can complete the predictive architecture construction process in a relatively short time, and the newly constructed architecture is superior to SOTA predefined models. This work bridges the gap in applying NAS to TSF problems, assisting non-experts and industries in automatically designing effective PVPF models.</description>

      <title>Privacy-preserving datasets by capturing feature distributions with Conditional VAEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large and well-annotated datasets are essential for advancing deep learning applications, however often costly or impossible to obtain by a single entity. In many areas, including the medical domain, approaches relying on data sharing have become critical to address those challenges. While effective in increasing dataset size and diversity, data sharing raises significant privacy concerns. Commonly employed anonymization methods based on the k-anonymity paradigm often fail to preserve data diversity, affecting model robustness. This work introduces a novel approach using Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) trained on feature vectors extracted from large pre-trained vision foundation models. Foundation models effectively detect and represent complex patterns across diverse domains, allowing the CVAE to faithfully capture the embedding space of a given data distribution to generate (sample) a diverse, privacy-respecting, and potentially unbounded set of synthetic feature vectors. Our method notably outperforms traditional approaches in both medical and natural image domains, exhibiting greater dataset diversity and higher robustness against perturbations while preserving sample privacy. These results underscore the potential of generative models to significantly impact deep learning applications in data-scarce and privacy-sensitive environments.

      <title>Enhancing Ethereum Fraud Detection via Generative and Contrastive Self-supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rampant fraudulent activities on Ethereum hinder the healthy development of the blockchain ecosystem, necessitating the reinforcement of regulations. However, multiple imbalances involving account interaction frequencies and interaction types in the Ethereum transaction environment pose significant challenges to data mining-based fraud detection research. To address this, we first propose the concept of meta-interactions to refine interaction behaviors in Ethereum, and based on this, we present a dual self-supervision enhanced Ethereum fraud detection framework, named Meta-IFD. This framework initially introduces a generative self-supervision mechanism to augment the interaction features of accounts, followed by a contrastive self-supervision mechanism to differentiate various behavior patterns, and ultimately characterizes the behavioral representations of accounts and mines potential fraud risks through multi-view interaction feature learning. Extensive experiments on real Ethereum datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework in detecting common Ethereum fraud behaviors such as Ponzi schemes and phishing scams. Additionally, the generative module can effectively alleviate the interaction distribution imbalance in Ethereum data, while the contrastive module significantly enhances the framework's ability to distinguish different behavior patterns. The source code will be released on GitHub soon.</description>

Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate an innovative stock index prediction method using a weighted optical reservoir computing system. We construct fundamental market data combined with macroeconomic data and technical indicators to capture the broader behavior of the stock market. Our approach shows significant higher performance than state-of-the-art methods such as linear regression, decision trees, and neural network architectures including long short-term memory.

      <title>Disentangling Dense Embeddings with Sparse Autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have shown promise in extracting interpretable features from complex neural networks. We present one of the first applications of SAEs to dense text embeddings from large language models, demonstrating their effectiveness in disentangling semantic concepts. By training SAEs on embeddings of over 420,000 scientific paper abstracts from computer science and astronomy, we show that the resulting sparse representations maintain semantic fidelity while offering interpretability. We analyse these learned features, exploring their behaviour across different model capacities and introducing a novel method for identifying ``feature families'' that represent related concepts at varying levels of abstraction. To demonstrate the practical utility of our approach, we show how these interpretable features can be used to precisely steer semantic search, allowing for fine-grained control over query semantics. This work bridges the gap between the semantic richness of dense embeddings and the interpretability of sparse representations. We open source our embeddings, trained sparse autoencoders, and interpreted features, as well as a web app for exploring them.</description>

      <title>AutoM3L: An Automated Multimodal Machine Learning Framework with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) offers a promising approach to streamline the training of machine learning models. However, existing AutoML frameworks are often limited to unimodal scenarios and require extensive manual configuration. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their exceptional abilities in reasoning, interaction, and code generation, presenting an opportunity to develop a more automated and user-friendly framework. To this end, we introduce AutoM3L, an innovative Automated Multimodal Machine Learning framework that leverages LLMs as controllers to automatically construct multimodal training pipelines. AutoM3L comprehends data modalities and selects appropriate models based on user requirements, providing automation and interactivity. By eliminating the need for manual feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization, our framework simplifies user engagement and enables customization through directives, addressing the limitations of previous rule-based AutoML approaches. We evaluate the performance of AutoM3L on six diverse multimodal datasets spanning classification, regression, and retrieval tasks, as well as a comprehensive set of unimodal datasets. The results demonstrate that AutoM3L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to traditional rule-based AutoML methods. Furthermore, a user study highlights the user-friendliness and usability of our framework, compared to the rule-based AutoML methods.</description>

      <title>An effect analysis of the balancing techniques on the counterfactual explanations of student success prediction models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, we have experienced a massive boom in the usage of digital solutions in higher education. Due to this boom, large amounts of data have enabled advanced data analysis methods to support learners and examine learning processes. One of the dominant research directions in learning analytics is predictive modeling of learners' success using various machine learning methods. To build learners' and teachers' trust in such methods and systems, exploring the methods and methodologies that enable relevant stakeholders to deeply understand the underlying machine-learning models is necessary. In this context, counterfactual explanations from explainable machine learning tools are promising. Several counterfactual generation methods hold much promise, but the features must be actionable and causal to be effective. Thus, obtaining which counterfactual generation method suits the student success prediction models in terms of desiderata, stability, and robustness is essential. Although a few studies have been published in recent years on the use of counterfactual explanations in educational sciences, they have yet to discuss which counterfactual generation method is more suitable for this problem. This paper analyzed the effectiveness of commonly used counterfactual generation methods, such as WhatIf Counterfactual Explanations, Multi-Objective Counterfactual Explanations, and Nearest Instance Counterfactual Explanations after balancing. This contribution presents a case study using the Open University Learning Analytics dataset to demonstrate the practical usefulness of counterfactual explanations. The results illustrate the method's effectiveness and describe concrete steps that could be taken to alter the model's prediction.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Full Waveform Inversion By Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a powerful tool for reconstructing material fields based on sparsely measured data obtained by wave propagation. For specific problems, discretizing the material field with a neural network (NN) improves the robustness and reconstruction quality of the corresponding optimization problem. We call this method NN-based FWI. Starting from an initial guess, the weights of the NN are iteratively updated to fit the simulated wave signals to the sparsely measured data set. For gradient-based optimization, a suitable choice of the initial guess, i.e., a suitable NN weight initialization, is crucial for fast and robust convergence.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel transfer learning approach to further improve NN-based FWI. This approach leverages supervised pretraining to provide a better NN weight initialization, leading to faster convergence of the subsequent optimization problem. Moreover, the inversions yield physically more meaningful local minima. The network is pretrained to predict the unknown material field using the gradient information from the first iteration of conventional FWI. In our computational experiments on two-dimensional domains, the training data set consists of reference simulations with arbitrarily positioned elliptical voids of different shapes and orientations. We compare the performance of the proposed transfer learning NN-based FWI with three other methods: conventional FWI, NN-based FWI without pretraining and conventional FWI with an initial guess predicted from the pretrained NN. Our results show that transfer learning NN-based FWI outperforms the other methods in terms of convergence speed and reconstruction quality.</description>

      <title>Granular-Balls based Fuzzy Twin Support Vector Machine for Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The twin support vector machine (TWSVM) classifier has attracted increasing attention because of its low computational complexity. However, its performance tends to degrade when samples are affected by noise. The granular-ball fuzzy support vector machine (GBFSVM) classifier partly alleviates the adverse effects of noise, but it relies solely on the distance between the granular-ball's center and the class center to design the granular-ball membership function. In this paper, we first introduce the granular-ball twin support vector machine (GBTWSVM) classifier, which integrates granular-ball computing (GBC) with the twin support vector machine (TWSVM) classifier. By replacing traditional point inputs with granular-balls, we demonstrate how to derive a pair of non-parallel hyperplanes for the GBTWSVM classifier by solving a quadratic programming problem. Subsequently, we design the membership and non-membership functions of granular-balls using Pythagorean fuzzy sets to differentiate the contributions of granular-balls in various regions. Additionally, we develop the granular-ball fuzzy twin support vector machine (GBFTSVM) classifier by incorporating GBC with the fuzzy twin support vector machine (FTSVM) classifier. We demonstrate how to derive a pair of non-parallel hyperplanes for the GBFTSVM classifier by solving a quadratic programming problem. We also design algorithms for the GBTSVM classifier and the GBFTSVM classifier. Finally, the superior classification performance of the GBTWSVM classifier and the GBFTSVM classifier on 20 benchmark datasets underscores their scalability, efficiency, and robustness in tackling classification tasks.</description>

      <title>You Can't Ignore Either: Unifying Structure and Feature Denoising for Robust Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research on the robustness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) under noises or attacks has attracted great attention due to its importance in real-world applications. Most previous methods explore a single noise source, recovering corrupt node embedding by reliable structures bias or developing structure learning with reliable node features. However, the noises and attacks may come from both structures and features in graphs, making the graph denoising a dilemma and challenging problem. In this paper, we develop a unified graph denoising (UGD) framework to unravel the deadlock between structure and feature denoising. Specifically, a high-order neighborhood proximity evaluation method is proposed to recognize noisy edges, considering features may be perturbed simultaneously. Moreover, we propose to refine noisy features with reconstruction based on a graph auto-encoder. An iterative updating algorithm is further designed to optimize the framework and acquire a clean graph, thus enabling robust graph learning for downstream tasks. Our UGD framework is self-supervised and can be easily implemented as a plug-and-play module. We carry out extensive experiments, which proves the effectiveness and advantages of our method.

      <title>Insurance Portfolio Pursuit with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When faced with a new customer, many factors contribute to an insurance firm's decision of what offer to make to that customer. In addition to the expected cost of providing the insurance, the firm must consider the other offers likely to be made to the customer, and how sensitive the customer is to differences in price. Moreover, firms often target a specific portfolio of customers that could depend on, e.g., age, location, and occupation. Given such a target portfolio, firms may choose to modulate an individual customer's offer based on whether the firm desires the customer within their portfolio. Given a target portfolio, we term the problem of modulating offers to achieve this target portfolio the portfolio pursuit problem. We give a formulation of portfolio pursuit as a sequential decision making problem, and devise a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for its solution. We test our method on a complex synthetic market environment, and demonstrate that it outperforms a baseline method which mimics current industry approaches to portfolio pursuit.</description>

      <title>A Natural Language Processing Framework for Hotel Recommendation Based on Users' Text Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the application of Artificial Intelligence algorithms in hotel recommendation systems has become an increasingly popular topic. One such method that has proven to be effective in this field is Deep Learning, especially Natural Language processing models, which are able to extract semantic knowledge from user's text reviews to create more efficient recommendation systems. This can lead to the development of intelligent models that can classify a user's preferences and emotions based on their feedback in the form of text reviews about their hotel stay experience. In this study, we propose a Natural Language Processing framework that utilizes customer text reviews to provide personalized recommendations for the most appropriate hotel based on their preferences. The framework is based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and a fine-tuning/validation pipeline that categorizes customer hotel review texts into "Bad," "Good," or "Excellent" recommended hotels. Our findings indicate that the hotel recommendation system we propose can significantly enhance the user experience of booking accommodations by providing personalized recommendations based on user preferences and previous booking history.</description>

      <title>Tamper-Resistant Safeguards for Open-Weight LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid advances in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have raised widespread concerns regarding their potential for malicious use. Open-weight LLMs present unique challenges, as existing safeguards lack robustness to tampering attacks that modify model weights. For example, recent works have demonstrated that refusal and unlearning safeguards can be trivially removed with a few steps of fine-tuning. These vulnerabilities necessitate new approaches for enabling the safe release of open-weight LLMs. We develop a method, called TAR, for building tamper-resistant safeguards into open-weight LLMs such that adversaries cannot remove the safeguards even after thousands of steps of fine-tuning. In extensive evaluations and red teaming analyses, we find that our method greatly improves tamper-resistance while preserving benign capabilities. Our results demonstrate that tamper-resistance is a tractable problem, opening up a promising new avenue to improve the safety and security of open-weight LLMs.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Generation of Difficult Math Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current LLM training positions mathematical reasoning as a core capability. With publicly available sources fully tapped, there is unmet demand for diverse and challenging math questions. Relying solely on human experts is both time-consuming and costly, while LLM-generated questions often lack the requisite diversity and difficulty. We present a design framework that combines the strengths of LLMs with a human-in-the-loop approach to generate a diverse array of challenging math questions. We leverage LLM metacognition skills [Didolkar et al., 2024] of a strong LLM to extract core "skills" from existing math datasets. These skills serve as the basis for generating novel and difficult questions by prompting the LLM with random pairs of core skills. The use of two different skills within each question makes finding such questions an "out of distribution" task for both LLMs and humans. Our pipeline employs LLMs to iteratively generate and refine questions and solutions through multiturn prompting. Human annotators then verify and further refine the questions, with their efficiency enhanced via further LLM interactions. Applying this pipeline on skills extracted from the MATH dataset [Hendrycks et al., 2021] resulted in MATH$^2$ - a dataset of higher-quality math questions, as evidenced by: (a) Lower performance of all models on MATH$^2$ than on MATH (b) Higher performance on MATH when using MATH$^2$ questions as in-context examples. Although focused on mathematics, our methodology seems applicable to other domains requiring structured reasoning, and potentially as a component of scalable oversight. Also of interest is a striking relationship observed between models' performance on the new dataset: the success rate on MATH$^2$ is the square on MATH, suggesting that successfully solving the question in MATH$^2$ requires a nontrivial combination of two distinct math skills.</description>

      <title>Framework for Curating Speech Datasets and Evaluating ASR Systems: A Case Study for Polish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech datasets available in the public domain are often underutilized because of challenges in discoverability and interoperability. A comprehensive framework has been designed to survey, catalog, and curate available speech datasets, which allows replicable evaluation of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. A case study focused on the Polish language was conducted; the framework was applied to curate more than 24 datasets and evaluate 25 combinations of ASR systems and models. This research constitutes the most extensive comparison to date of both commercial and free ASR systems for the Polish language. It draws insights from 600 system-model-test set evaluations, marking a significant advancement in both scale and comprehensiveness. The results of surveys and performance comparisons are available as interactive dashboards (https://huggingface.co/spaces/amu-cai/pl-asr-leaderboard) along with curated datasets (https://huggingface.co/datasets/amu-cai/pl-asr-bigos-v2, https://huggingface.co/datasets/pelcra/pl-asr-pelcra-for-bigos) and the open challenge call (https://poleval.pl/tasks/task3). Tools used for evaluation are open-sourced (https://github.com/goodmike31/pl-asr-bigos-tools), facilitating replication and adaptation for other languages, as well as continuous expansion with new datasets and systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for time series generation built to investigate anomaly detection in cloud microservices. In the field of cloud computing, ensuring the reliability of microservices is of paramount concern and yet a remarkably challenging task. Despite the large amount of research in this area, validation of anomaly detection algorithms in realistic environments is difficult to achieve. To address this challenge, we propose a framework to mimic the complex time series patterns representative of both normal and anomalous cloud microservices behaviors. We detail the pipeline implementation that allows deployment and management of microservices as well as the theoretical approach required to generate anomalies. Two datasets generated using the proposed framework have been made publicly available through GitHub.</description>

      <title>ScaleLLM: A Resource-Frugal LLM Serving Framework by Optimizing End-to-End Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have surged in popularity and are extensively used in commercial applications, where the efficiency of model serving is crucial for the user experience. Most current research focuses on optimizing individual sub-procedures, e.g. local inference and communication, however, there is no comprehensive framework that provides a holistic system view for optimizing LLM serving in an end-to-end manner. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis to identify major bottlenecks that impact end-to-end latency in LLM serving systems. Our analysis reveals that a comprehensive LLM serving endpoint must address a series of efficiency bottlenecks that extend beyond LLM inference. We then propose ScaleLLM, an optimized system for resource-efficient LLM serving. Our extensive experiments reveal that with 64 concurrent requests, ScaleLLM achieves a 4.3x speed up over vLLM and outperforms state-of-the-arts with 1.5x higher throughput.</description>

      <title>A New Type of Foundation Model Based on Recordings of People's Emotions and Physiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have had a big impact in recent years and billions of dollars are being invested in them in the current AI boom. The more popular ones, such as Chat-GPT, are trained on large amounts of data from the Internet, and then reinforcement learning, RAG, prompt engineering and cognitive modelling are used to fine-tune and augment their behavior. This technology has been used to create models of individual people, such as Caryn Marjorie. However, these chatbots are not based on people's actual emotional and physiological responses to their environment, so they are, at best, surface-level approximations to the characters they are imitating. This paper describes how a new type of foundation model - a first-person foundation model - could be created from recordings of what a person sees and hears as well as their emotional and physiological reactions to these stimuli. A first-person foundation model would map environmental stimuli to a person's emotional and physiological states, and map a person's emotional and physiological states to their behavior. First-person foundation models have many exciting applications, including a new type of recommendation engine, personal assistants, generative adversarial networks, dating and recruitment. To obtain training data for a first-person foundation model, we have developed a recording rig that captures what the wearer is seeing and hearing as well as their emotional and physiological states. This novel source of data could help to address the shortage of new data for building the next generation of foundation models.</description>

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target interactions is critical for advancing drug discovery. By reducing time and cost, machine learning and deep learning can accelerate this discovery process. Our approach utilises the powerful Barlow Twins architecture for feature-extraction while considering the structure of the target protein, achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance against multiple established benchmarks. The use of gradient boosting machine as the underlying predictor ensures fast and efficient predictions without the need for large computational resources. In addition, we further benchmarked new baselines against existing methods. Together, these innovations improve the efficiency and effectiveness of drug-target interaction predictions, providing robust tools for accelerating drug development and deepening the understanding of molecular interactions.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Collaborative Machine Learning under Statistical Heterogeneity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning from distributed data without accessing them is undoubtedly a challenging and non-trivial task. Nevertheless, the necessity for distributed training of a statistical model has been increasing, due to the privacy concerns of local data owners and the cost in centralizing the massively distributed data. Federated learning (FL) is currently the de facto standard of training a machine learning model across heterogeneous data owners, without leaving the raw data out of local silos. Nevertheless, several challenges must be addressed in order for FL to be more practical in reality. Among these challenges, the statistical heterogeneity problem is the most significant and requires immediate attention. From the main objective of FL, three major factors can be considered as starting points -- \textit{parameter}, textit{mixing coefficient}, and \textit{local data distributions}. In alignment with the components, this dissertation is organized into three parts. In Chapter II, a novel personalization method, \texttt{SuPerFed}, inspired by the mode-connectivity is introduced. In Chapter III, an adaptive decision-making algorithm, \texttt{AAggFF}, is introduced for inducing uniform performance distributions in participating clients, which is realized by online convex optimization framework. Finally, in Chapter IV, a collaborative synthetic data generation method, \texttt{FedEvg}, is introduced, leveraging the flexibility and compositionality of an energy-based modeling approach. Taken together, all of these approaches provide practical solutions to mitigate the statistical heterogeneity problem in data-decentralized settings, paving the way for distributed systems and applications using collaborative machine learning methods.</description>

      <title>GOProteinGNN: Leveraging Protein Knowledge Graphs for Protein Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins play a vital role in biological processes and are indispensable for living organisms. Accurate representation of proteins is crucial, especially in drug development. Recently, there has been a notable increase in interest in utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques for unsupervised learning of protein representations. However, these approaches often focus solely on the amino acid sequence of proteins and lack factual knowledge about proteins and their interactions, thus limiting their performance. In this study, we present GOProteinGNN, a novel architecture that enhances protein language models by integrating protein knowledge graph information during the creation of amino acid level representations. Our approach allows for the integration of information at both the individual amino acid level and the entire protein level, enabling a comprehensive and effective learning process through graph-based learning. By doing so, we can capture complex relationships and dependencies between proteins and their functional annotations, resulting in more robust and contextually enriched protein representations. Unlike previous fusion methods, GOProteinGNN uniquely learns the entire protein knowledge graph during training, which allows it to capture broader relational nuances and dependencies beyond mere triplets as done in previous work. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on several downstream tasks demonstrating that GOProteinGNN consistently outperforms previous methods, showcasing its effectiveness and establishing it as a state-of-the-art solution for protein representation learning.</description>

I present classic results such as the universal approximation theorem and neural network / Gaussian process correspondence, and also more recent results such as the neural tangent kernel, feature learning with the maximal update parameterization, and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks. The exposition on neural network theory emphasizes a field theoretic perspective familiar to theoretical physicists.

      <title>Approximating Rayleigh Scattering in Exoplanetary Atmospheres using Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research introduces an innovative application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to tackle the intricate challenges of radiative transfer (RT) modeling in exoplanetary atmospheres, with a special focus on efficiently handling scattering phenomena. Traditional RT models often simplify scattering as absorption, leading to inaccuracies. Our approach utilizes PINNs, noted for their ability to incorporate the governing differential equations of RT directly into their loss function, thus offering a more precise yet potentially fast modeling technique. The core of our method involves the development of a parameterized PINN tailored for a modified RT equation, enhancing its adaptability to various atmospheric scenarios. We focus on RT in transiting exoplanet atmospheres using a simplified 1D isothermal model with pressure-dependent coefficients for absorption and Rayleigh scattering. In scenarios of pure absorption, the PINN demonstrates its effectiveness in predicting transmission spectra for diverse absorption profiles. For Rayleigh scattering, the network successfully computes the RT equation, addressing both direct and diffuse stellar light components. While our preliminary results with simplified models are promising, indicating the potential of PINNs in improving RT calculations, we acknowledge the errors stemming from our approximations as well as the challenges in applying this technique to more complex atmospheric conditions. Specifically, extending our approach to atmospheres with intricate temperature-pressure profiles and varying scattering properties, such as those introduced by clouds and hazes, remains a significant area for future development.</description>

      <title>Certifying Robustness of Learning-Based Keypoint Detection and Pose Estimation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the certification of the local robustness of vision-based two-stage 6D object pose estimation. The two-stage method for object pose estimation achieves superior accuracy by first employing deep neural network-driven keypoint regression and then applying a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) technique. Despite advancements, the certification of these methods' robustness remains scarce. This research aims to fill this gap with a focus on their local robustness on the system level--the capacity to maintain robust estimations amidst semantic input perturbations. The core idea is to transform the certification of local robustness into neural network verification for classification tasks. The challenge is to develop model, input, and output specifications that align with off-the-shelf verification tools. To facilitate verification, we modify the keypoint detection model by substituting nonlinear operations with those more amenable to the verification processes. Instead of injecting random noise into images, as is common, we employ a convex hull representation of images as input specifications to more accurately depict semantic perturbations. Furthermore, by conducting a sensitivity analysis, we propagate the robustness criteria from pose to keypoint accuracy, and then formulating an optimal error threshold allocation problem that allows for the setting of a maximally permissible keypoint deviation thresholds. Viewing each pixel as an individual class, these thresholds result in linear, classification-akin output specifications. Under certain conditions, we demonstrate that the main components of our certification framework are both sound and complete, and validate its effects through extensive evaluations on realistic perturbations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to certify the robustness of large-scale, keypoint-based pose estimation given images in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Vera Verto: Multimodal Hijacking Attack</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing cost of training machine learning (ML) models has led to the inclusion of new parties to the training pipeline, such as users who contribute training data and companies that provide computing resources. This involvement of such new parties in the ML training process has introduced new attack surfaces for an adversary to exploit. A recent attack in this domain is the model hijacking attack, whereby an adversary hijacks a victim model to implement their own -- possibly malicious -- hijacking tasks. However, the scope of the model hijacking attack is so far limited to the homogeneous-modality tasks. In this paper, we transform the model hijacking attack into a more general multimodal setting, where the hijacking and original tasks are performed on data of different modalities. Specifically, we focus on the setting where an adversary implements a natural language processing (NLP) hijacking task into an image classification model. To mount the attack, we propose a novel encoder-decoder based framework, namely the Blender, which relies on advanced image and language models. Experimental results show that our modal hijacking attack achieves strong performances in different settings. For instance, our attack achieves 94%, 94%, and 95% attack success rate when using the Sogou news dataset to hijack STL10, CIFAR-10, and MNIST classifiers.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Optimization as a Scalable Framework to Characterize Extreme Value Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to develop distributionally robust optimization (DRO) estimators, specifically for multidimensional Extreme Value Theory (EVT) statistics. EVT supports using semi-parametric models called max-stable distributions built from spatial Poisson point processes. While powerful, these models are only asymptotically valid for large samples. However, since extreme data is by definition scarce, the potential for model misspecification error is inherent to these applications, thus DRO estimators are natural. In order to mitigate over-conservative estimates while enhancing out-of-sample performance, we study DRO estimators informed by semi-parametric max-stable constraints in the space of point processes. We study both tractable convex formulations for some problems of interest (e.g. CVaR) and more general neural network based estimators. Both approaches are validated using synthetically generated data, recovering prescribed characteristics, and verifying the efficacy of the proposed techniques. Additionally, the proposed method is applied to a real data set of financial returns for comparison to a previous analysis. We established the proposed model as a novel formulation in the multivariate EVT domain, and innovative with respect to performance when compared to relevant alternate proposals.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Conditioning of Diffusion Models Using Tree-of-Life for Studying Species Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central problem in biology is to understand how organisms evolve and adapt to their environment by acquiring variations in the observable characteristics or traits of species across the tree of life. With the growing availability of large-scale image repositories in biology and recent advances in generative modeling, there is an opportunity to accelerate the discovery of evolutionary traits automatically from images. Toward this goal, we introduce Phylo-Diffusion, a novel framework for conditioning diffusion models with phylogenetic knowledge represented in the form of HIERarchical Embeddings (HIER-Embeds). We also propose two new experiments for perturbing the embedding space of Phylo-Diffusion: trait masking and trait swapping, inspired by counterpart experiments of gene knockout and gene editing/swapping. Our work represents a novel methodological advance in generative modeling to structure the embedding space of diffusion models using tree-based knowledge. Our work also opens a new chapter of research in evolutionary biology by using generative models to visualize evolutionary changes directly from images. We empirically demonstrate the usefulness of Phylo-Diffusion in capturing meaningful trait variations for fishes and birds, revealing novel insights about the biological mechanisms of their evolution.</description>

      <title>Automatic Generation of Behavioral Test Cases For Natural Language Processing Using Clustering and Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work in behavioral testing for natural language processing (NLP) models, such as Checklist, is inspired by related paradigms in software engineering testing. They allow evaluation of general linguistic capabilities and domain understanding, hence can help evaluate conceptual soundness and identify model weaknesses. However, a major challenge is the creation of test cases. The current packages rely on semi-automated approach using manual development which requires domain expertise and can be time consuming. This paper introduces an automated approach to develop test cases by exploiting the power of large language models and statistical techniques. It clusters the text representations to carefully construct meaningful groups and then apply prompting techniques to automatically generate Minimal Functionality Tests (MFT). The well-known Amazon Reviews corpus is used to demonstrate our approach. We analyze the behavioral test profiles across four different classification algorithms and discuss the limitations and strengths of those models.</description>

      <title>A Taxonomy of Stereotype Content in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a taxonomy of stereotype content in contemporary large language models (LLMs). We prompt ChatGPT 3.5, Llama 3, and Mixtral 8x7B, three powerful and widely used LLMs, for the characteristics associated with 87 social categories (e.g., gender, race, occupations). We identify 14 stereotype dimensions (e.g., Morality, Ability, Health, Beliefs, Emotions), accounting for ~90% of LLM stereotype associations. Warmth and Competence facets were the most frequent content, but all other dimensions were significantly prevalent. Stereotypes were more positive in LLMs (vs. humans), but there was significant variability across categories and dimensions. Finally, the taxonomy predicted the LLMs' internal evaluations of social categories (e.g., how positively/negatively the categories were represented), supporting the relevance of a multidimensional taxonomy for characterizing LLM stereotypes. Our findings suggest that high-dimensional human stereotypes are reflected in LLMs and must be considered in AI auditing and debiasing to minimize unidentified harms from reliance in low-dimensional views of bias in LLMs.</description>

Abstract: Explainability of recommender systems has become essential to ensure users' trust and satisfaction. Various types of explainable recommender systems have been proposed including explainable graph-based recommender systems. This review paper discusses state-of-the-art approaches of these systems and categorizes them based on three aspects: learning methods, explaining methods, and explanation types. It also explores the commonly used datasets, explainability evaluation methods, and future directions of this research area. Compared with the existing review papers, this paper focuses on explainability based on graphs and covers the topics required for developing novel explainable graph-based recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Strike the Balance: On-the-Fly Uncertainty based User Interactions for Long-Term Video Object Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a variant of video object segmentation (VOS) that bridges interactive and semi-automatic approaches, termed Lazy Video Object Segmentation (ziVOS). In contrast, to both tasks, which handle video object segmentation in an off-line manner (i.e., pre-recorded sequences), we propose through ziVOS to target online recorded sequences. Here, we strive to strike a balance between performance and robustness for long-term scenarios by soliciting user feedback's on-the-fly during the segmentation process. Hence, we aim to maximize the tracking duration of an object of interest, while requiring minimal user corrections to maintain tracking over an extended period. We propose a competitive baseline, i.e., Lazy-XMem, as a reference for future works in ziVOS. Our proposed approach uses an uncertainty estimation of the tracking state to determine whether a user interaction is necessary to refine the model's prediction. To quantitatively assess the performance of our method and the user's workload, we introduce complementary metrics alongside those already established in the field. We evaluate our approach using the recently introduced LVOS dataset, which offers numerous long-term videos. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Vujas-Eteph/LazyXMem.</description>

      <title>CREW: Facilitating Human-AI Teaming Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the potential of humans working with AI agents has been growing at a great speed. Human-AI teaming is an important paradigm for studying various aspects when humans and AI agents work together. The unique aspect of Human-AI teaming research is the need to jointly study humans and AI agents, demanding multidisciplinary research efforts from machine learning to human-computer interaction, robotics, cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology, social science, and complex systems. However, existing platforms for Human-AI teaming research are limited, often supporting oversimplified scenarios and a single task, or specifically focusing on either human-teaming research or multi-agent AI algorithms. We introduce CREW, a platform to facilitate Human-AI teaming research and engage collaborations from multiple scientific disciplines, with a strong emphasis on human involvement. It includes pre-built tasks for cognitive studies and Human-AI teaming with expandable potentials from our modular design. Following conventional cognitive neuroscience research, CREW also supports multimodal human physiological signal recording for behavior analysis. Moreover, CREW benchmarks real-time human-guided reinforcement learning agents using state-of-the-art algorithms and well-tuned baselines. With CREW, we were able to conduct 50 human subject studies within a week to verify the effectiveness of our benchmark.</description>

      <title>Adapting Skills to Novel Grasps: A Self-Supervised Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of adapting manipulation trajectories involving grasped objects (e.g. tools) defined for a single grasp pose to novel grasp poses. A common approach to address this is to define a new trajectory for each possible grasp explicitly, but this is highly inefficient. Instead, we propose a method to adapt such trajectories directly while only requiring a period of self-supervised data collection, during which a camera observes the robot's end-effector moving with the object rigidly grasped. Importantly, our method requires no prior knowledge of the grasped object (such as a 3D CAD model), it can work with RGB images, depth images, or both, and it requires no camera calibration. Through a series of real-world experiments involving 1360 evaluations, we find that self-supervised RGB data consistently outperforms alternatives that rely on depth images including several state-of-the-art pose estimation methods. Compared to the best-performing baseline, our method results in an average of 28.5% higher success rate when adapting manipulation trajectories to novel grasps on several everyday tasks. Videos of the experiments are available on our webpage at https://www.robot-learning.uk/adapting-skills</description>

      <title>Combining audio control and style transfer using latent diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models are now able to synthesize high-quality audio signals, shifting the critical aspect in their development from audio quality to control capabilities. Although text-to-music generation is getting largely adopted by the general public, explicit control and example-based style transfer are more adequate modalities to capture the intents of artists and musicians.
  In this paper, we aim to unify explicit control and style transfer within a single model by separating local and global information to capture musical structure and timbre respectively. To do so, we leverage the capabilities of diffusion autoencoders to extract semantic features, in order to build two representation spaces. We enforce disentanglement between those spaces using an adversarial criterion and a two-stage training strategy. Our resulting model can generate audio matching a timbre target, while specifying structure either with explicit controls or through another audio example. We evaluate our model on one-shot timbre transfer and MIDI-to-audio tasks on instrumental recordings and show that we outperform existing baselines in terms of audio quality and target fidelity. Furthermore, we show that our method can generate cover versions of complete musical pieces by transferring rhythmic and melodic content to the style of a target audio in a different genre.</description>

      <title>Automated Software Vulnerability Static Code Analysis Using Generative Pre-Trained Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Pre-Trained Transformer models have been shown to be surprisingly effective at a variety of natural language processing tasks -- including generating computer code. We evaluate the effectiveness of open source GPT models for the task of automatic identification of the presence of vulnerable code syntax (specifically targeting C and C++ source code). This task is evaluated on a selection of 36 source code examples from the NIST SARD dataset, which are specifically curated to not contain natural English that indicates the presence, or lack thereof, of a particular vulnerability. The NIST SARD source code dataset contains identified vulnerable lines of source code that are examples of one out of the 839 distinct Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE), allowing for exact quantification of the GPT output classification error rate. A total of 5 GPT models are evaluated, using 10 different inference temperatures and 100 repetitions at each setting, resulting in 5,000 GPT queries per vulnerable source code analyzed. Ultimately, we find that the GPT models that we evaluated are not suitable for fully automated vulnerability scanning because the false positive and false negative rates are too high to likely be useful in practice. However, we do find that the GPT models perform surprisingly well at automated vulnerability detection for some of the test cases, in particular surpassing random sampling, and being able to identify the exact lines of code that are vulnerable albeit at a low success rate. The best performing GPT model result found was Llama-2-70b-chat-hf with inference temperature of 0.1 applied to NIST SARD test case 149165 (which is an example of a buffer overflow vulnerability), which had a binary classification recall score of 1.0 and a precision of 1.0 for correctly and uniquely identifying the vulnerable line of code and the correct CWE number.</description>

      <title>OmniParser for Pure Vision Based GUI Agent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent success of large vision language models shows great potential in driving the agent system operating on user interfaces. However, we argue that the power multimodal models like GPT-4V as a general agent on multiple operating systems across different applications is largely underestimated due to the lack of a robust screen parsing technique capable of: 1) reliably identifying interactable icons within the user interface, and 2) understanding the semantics of various elements in a screenshot and accurately associate the intended action with the corresponding region on the screen. To fill these gaps, we introduce \textsc{OmniParser}, a comprehensive method for parsing user interface screenshots into structured elements, which significantly enhances the ability of GPT-4V to generate actions that can be accurately grounded in the corresponding regions of the interface. We first curated an interactable icon detection dataset using popular webpages and an icon description dataset. These datasets were utilized to fine-tune specialized models: a detection model to parse interactable regions on the screen and a caption model to extract the functional semantics of the detected elements. \textsc{OmniParser} significantly improves GPT-4V's performance on ScreenSpot benchmark. And on Mind2Web and AITW benchmark, \textsc{OmniParser} with screenshot only input outperforms the GPT-4V baselines requiring additional information outside of screenshot.</description>

      <title>Prognosis of COVID-19 using Artificial Intelligence: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been extensively utilized for diagnosing and prognosis of several diseases in recent years. This study identifies, appraises and synthesizes published studies on the use of AI for the prognosis of COVID-19. Method: Electronic search was performed using Medline, Google Scholar, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane and ProQuest. Studies that examined machine learning or deep learning methods to determine the prognosis of COVID-19 using CT or chest X-ray images were included. Polled sensitivity, specificity area under the curve and diagnostic odds ratio were calculated. Result: A total of 36 articles were included; various prognosis-related issues, including disease severity, mechanical ventilation or admission to the intensive care unit and mortality, were investigated. Several AI models and architectures were employed, such as the Siamense model, support vector machine, Random Forest , eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and convolutional neural networks. The models achieved 71%, 88% and 67% sensitivity for mortality, severity assessment and need for ventilation, respectively. The specificity of 69%, 89% and 89% were reported for the aforementioned variables. Conclusion: Based on the included articles, machine learning and deep learning methods used for the prognosis of COVID-19 patients using radiomic features from CT or CXR images can help clinicians manage patients and allocate resources more effectively. These studies also demonstrate that combining patient demographic, clinical data, laboratory tests and radiomic features improves model performances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, topological data analysis (TDA) has become a trending topic in data science and engineering. However, the key technique of TDA, i.e., persistent homology, is defined on point cloud data, which restricts its scope. In this work, we propose persistent de Rham-Hodge Laplacian, or persistent Hodge Laplacian (PHL) for abbreviation, for the TDA on manifolds with boundaries, or volumetric data. Specifically, we extended the evolutionary de Rham-Hodge theory from the Lagrangian formulation to the Eulerian formulation via structure-persevering Cartesian grids, and extended the persistent Laplacian on point clouds to persistent (de Rham-)Hodge Laplacian on nested families of manifolds with appropriate boundary conditions. The proposed PHL facilitates the machine learning and deep learning prediction of volumetric data. For a proof-of-principle application of the proposed PHL, we propose a persistent Hodge Laplacian learning (PHLL) algorithm for data on manifolds or volumetric data. To this end, we showcase the PHLL prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities in two benchmark datasets. Our numerical experiments highlight the power and promise of PHLL.</description>

      <title>Invariant Discovery of Features Across Multiple Length Scales: Applications in Microscopy and Autonomous Materials Characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical imaging is a foundational characterization method in areas from condensed matter physics and chemistry to astronomy and spans length scales from atomic to universe. Images encapsulate crucial data regarding atomic bonding, materials microstructures, and dynamic phenomena such as microstructural evolution and turbulence, among other phenomena. The challenge lies in effectively extracting and interpreting this information. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have emerged as powerful tools for identifying underlying factors of variation in image data, providing a systematic approach to distilling meaningful patterns from complex datasets. However, a significant hurdle in their application is the definition and selection of appropriate descriptors reflecting local structure. Here we introduce the scale-invariant VAE approach (SI-VAE) based on the progressive training of the VAE with the descriptors sampled at different length scales. The SI-VAE allows the discovery of the length scale dependent factors of variation in the system. Here, we illustrate this approach using the ferroelectric domain images and generalize it to the movies of the electron-beam induced phenomena in graphene and topography evolution across combinatorial libraries. This approach can further be used to initialize the decision making in automated experiments including structure-property discovery and can be applied across a broad range of imaging methods. This approach is universal and can be applied to any spatially resolved data including both experimental imaging studies and simulations, and can be particularly useful for exploration of phenomena such as turbulence, scale-invariant transformation fronts, etc.</description>

Abstract: Graph neural network training is mainly categorized into mini-batch and full-batch training methods. The mini-batch training method samples subgraphs from the original graph in each iteration. This sampling operation introduces extra computation overhead and reduces the training accuracy. Meanwhile, the full-batch training method calculates the features and corresponding gradients of all vertices in each iteration, and therefore has higher convergence accuracy. However, in the distributed cluster, frequent remote accesses of vertex features and gradients lead to huge communication overhead, thus restricting the overall training efficiency.
  In this paper, we introduce the cached-based distributed full-batch graph neural network training framework (CDFGNN). We propose the adaptive cache mechanism to reduce the remote vertex access by caching the historical features and gradients of neighbor vertices. Besides, we further optimize the communication overhead by quantifying the messages and designing the graph partition algorithm for the hierarchical communication architecture. Experiments show that the adaptive cache mechanism reduces remote vertex accesses by 63.14% on average. Combined with communication quantization and hierarchical GP algorithm, CDFGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art distributed full-batch training frameworks by 30.39% in our experiments. Our results indicate that CDFGNN has great potential in accelerating distributed full-batch GNN training tasks.</description>

      <title>Empirical Bayes Linked Matrix Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data for several applications in diverse fields can be represented as multiple matrices that are linked across rows or columns. This is particularly common in molecular biomedical research, in which multiple molecular "omics" technologies may capture different feature sets (e.g., corresponding to rows in a matrix) and/or different sample populations (corresponding to columns). This has motivated a large body of work on integrative matrix factorization approaches that identify and decompose low-dimensional signal that is shared across multiple matrices or specific to a given matrix. We propose an empirical variational Bayesian approach to this problem that has several advantages over existing techniques, including the flexibility to accommodate shared signal over any number of row or column sets (i.e., bidimensional integration), an intuitive model-based objective function that yields appropriate shrinkage for the inferred signals, and a relatively efficient estimation algorithm with no tuning parameters. A general result establishes conditions for the uniqueness of the underlying decomposition for a broad family of methods that includes the proposed approach. For scenarios with missing data, we describe an associated iterative imputation approach that is novel for the single-matrix context and a powerful approach for "blockwise" imputation (in which an entire row or column is missing) in various linked matrix contexts. Extensive simulations show that the method performs very well under different scenarios with respect to recovering underlying low-rank signal, accurately decomposing shared and specific signals, and accurately imputing missing data. The approach is applied to gene expression and miRNA data from breast cancer tissue and normal breast tissue, for which it gives an informative decomposition of variation and outperforms alternative strategies for missing data imputation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Structured State Space Models via Grouped FIR Filtering and Attention Sink Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structured State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as compelling alternatives to Transformer architectures, offering linear-time complexity and superior performance in various sequence modeling tasks. Despite their advantages, SSMs like the original Mamba-2 face training difficulties due to the sensitivities introduced by the extended series of recurrent matrix multiplications. In this paper, we propose an advanced architecture that mitigates these challenges by decomposing A-multiplications into multiple groups and optimizing positional encoding through Grouped Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filtering. This new structure, denoted as Grouped FIR-enhanced SSM (GFSSM), employs semiseparable matrices for efficient computation. Furthermore, inspired by the "attention sink" phenomenon identified in streaming language models, we incorporate a similar mechanism to enhance the stability and performance of our model over extended sequences. Our approach further bridges the gap between SSMs and Transformer architectures, offering a viable path forward for scalable and high-performing sequence modeling.</description>

      <title>Clover-2: Accurate Inference for Regressive Lightweight Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently suffer from inefficiencies, largely attributable to the discord between the requirements of auto-regressive decoding and the architecture of contemporary GPUs. Recently, regressive lightweight speculative decoding has garnered attention for its notable efficiency improvements in text generation tasks. This approach utilizes a lightweight regressive draft model, like a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or a single transformer decoder layer, leveraging sequential information to iteratively predict potential tokens. Specifically, RNN draft models are computationally economical but tend to deliver lower accuracy, while attention decoder layer models exhibit the opposite traits. This paper presents Clover-2, an advanced iteration of Clover, an RNN-based draft model designed to achieve comparable accuracy to that of attention decoder layer models while maintaining minimal computational overhead. Clover-2 enhances the model architecture and incorporates knowledge distillation to increase Clover's accuracy and improve overall efficiency. We conducted experiments using the open-source Vicuna 7B and LLaMA3-Instruct 8B models. The results demonstrate that Clover-2 surpasses existing methods across various model architectures, showcasing its efficacy and robustness.</description>

      <title>Gradient Harmonization in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) intends to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Many current methods focus on learning feature representations that are both discriminative for classification and invariant across domains by simultaneously optimizing domain alignment and classification tasks. However, these methods often overlook a crucial challenge: the inherent conflict between these two tasks during gradient-based optimization. In this paper, we delve into this issue and introduce two effective solutions known as Gradient Harmonization, including GH and GH++, to mitigate the conflict between domain alignment and classification tasks. GH operates by altering the gradient angle between different tasks from an obtuse angle to an acute angle, thus resolving the conflict and trade-offing the two tasks in a coordinated manner. Yet, this would cause both tasks to deviate from their original optimization directions. We thus further propose an improved version, GH++, which adjusts the gradient angle between tasks from an obtuse angle to a vertical angle. This not only eliminates the conflict but also minimizes deviation from the original gradient directions. Finally, for optimization convenience and efficiency, we evolve the gradient harmonization strategies into a dynamically weighted loss function using an integral operator on the harmonized gradient. Notably, GH/GH++ are orthogonal to UDA and can be seamlessly integrated into most existing UDA models. Theoretical insights and experimental analyses demonstrate that the proposed approaches not only enhance popular UDA baselines but also improve recent state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Text Rewriting for Text-aware Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-aware recommender systems incorporate rich textual features, such as titles and descriptions, to generate item recommendations for users. The use of textual features helps mitigate cold-start problems, and thus, such recommender systems have attracted increased attention. However, we argue that the dependency on item descriptions makes the recommender system vulnerable to manipulation by adversarial sellers on e-commerce platforms. In this paper, we explore the possibility of such manipulation by proposing a new text rewriting framework to attack text-aware recommender systems. We show that the rewriting attack can be exploited by sellers to unfairly uprank their products, even though the adversarially rewritten descriptions are perceived as realistic by human evaluators. Methodologically, we investigate two different variations to carry out text rewriting attacks: (1) two-phase fine-tuning for greater attack performance, and (2) in-context learning for higher text rewriting quality. Experiments spanning 3 different datasets and 4 existing approaches demonstrate that recommender systems exhibit vulnerability against the proposed text rewriting attack. Our work adds to the existing literature around the robustness of recommender systems, while highlighting a new dimension of vulnerability in the age of large-scale automated text generation.</description>

Abstract: We tackle the recently introduced benchmark for whole-body humanoid control HumanoidBench using MuJoCo MPC. We find that sparse reward functions of HumanoidBench yield undesirable and unrealistic behaviors when optimized; therefore, we propose a set of regularization terms that stabilize the robot behavior across tasks. Current evaluations on a subset of tasks demonstrate that our proposed reward function allows achieving the highest HumanoidBench scores while maintaining realistic posture and smooth control signals. Our code is publicly available and will become a part of MuJoCo MPC, enabling rapid prototyping of robot behaviors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current visual navigation systems often treat the environment as static, lacking the ability to adaptively interact with obstacles. This limitation leads to navigation failure when encountering unavoidable obstructions. In response, we introduce IN-Sight, a novel approach to self-supervised path planning, enabling more effective navigation strategies through interaction with obstacles. Utilizing RGB-D observations, IN-Sight calculates traversability scores and incorporates them into a semantic map, facilitating long-range path planning in complex, maze-like environments. To precisely navigate around obstacles, IN-Sight employs a local planner, trained imperatively on a differentiable costmap using representation learning techniques. The entire framework undergoes end-to-end training within the state-of-the-art photorealistic Intel SPEAR Simulator. We validate the effectiveness of IN-Sight through extensive benchmarking in a variety of simulated scenarios and ablation studies. Moreover, we demonstrate the system's real-world applicability with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, deploying our planner on the legged robot platform ANYmal, showcasing its practical potential for interactive navigation in real environments.</description>

      <title>Conformal Trajectory Prediction with Multi-View Data Integration in Cooperative Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current research on trajectory prediction primarily relies on data collected by onboard sensors of an ego vehicle. With the rapid advancement in connected technologies, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, valuable information from alternate views becomes accessible via wireless networks. The integration of information from alternative views has the potential to overcome the inherent limitations associated with a single viewpoint, such as occlusions and limited field of view. In this work, we introduce V2INet, a novel trajectory prediction framework designed to model multi-view data by extending existing single-view models. Unlike previous approaches where the multi-view data is manually fused or formulated as a separate training stage, our model supports end-to-end training, enhancing both flexibility and performance. Moreover, the predicted multimodal trajectories are calibrated by a post-hoc conformal prediction module to get valid and efficient confidence regions. We evaluated the entire framework using the real-world V2I dataset V2X-Seq. Our results demonstrate superior performance in terms of Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Miss Rate (MR) using a single GPU. The code is publicly available at: \url{https://github.com/xichennn/V2I_trajectory_prediction}.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Pairwise Causal Discovery on Heterogeneous Data using Mutual Information Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental task in science is to determine the underlying causal relations because it is the knowledge of this functional structure what leads to the correct interpretation of an effect given the apparent associations in the observed data. In this sense, Causal Discovery is a technique that tackles this challenge by analyzing the statistical properties of the constituent variables. In this work, we target the generalizability of the discovery method by following a reductionist approach that only involves two variables, i.e., the pairwise or bi-variate setting. We question the current (possibly misleading) baseline results on the basis that they were obtained through supervised learning, which is arguably contrary to this genuinely exploratory endeavor. In consequence, we approach this problem in an unsupervised way, using robust Mutual Information measures, and observing the impact of the different variable types, which is oftentimes ignored in the design of solutions. Thus, we provide a novel set of standard unbiased results that can serve as a reference to guide future discovery tasks in completely unknown environments.</description>

      <title>Efficient Patient Fine-Tuned Seizure Detection with a Tensor Kernel Machine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in wearable devices have made accurate and efficient seizure detection more important than ever. A challenge in seizure detection is that patient-specific models typically outperform patient-independent models. However, in a wearable device one typically starts with a patient-independent model, until such patient-specific data is available. To avoid having to construct a new classifier with this data, as required in conventional kernel machines, we propose a transfer learning approach with a tensor kernel machine. This method learns the primal weights in a compressed form using the canonical polyadic decomposition, making it possible to efficiently update the weights of the patient-independent model with patient-specific data. The results show that this patient fine-tuned model reaches as high a performance as a patient-specific SVM model with a model size that is twice as small as the patient-specific model and ten times as small as the patient-independent model.</description>

      <title>Rapid and Power-Aware Learned Optimization for Modular Receive Beamforming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems play a key role in wireless communication technologies. A widely considered approach to realize scalable MIMO systems involves architectures comprised of multiple separate modules, each with its own beamforming capability. Such models accommodate cell-free massive MIMO and partially connected hybrid MIMO architectures. A core issue with the implementation of modular MIMO arises from the need to rapidly set the beampatterns of the modules, while maintaining their power efficiency. This leads to challenging constrained optimization that should be repeatedly solved on each coherence duration. In this work, we propose a power-oriented optimization algorithm for beamforming in uplink modular hybrid MIMO systems, which learns from data to operate rapidly. We derive our learned optimizer by tackling the rate maximization objective using projected gradient ascent steps with momentum. We then leverage data to tune the hyperparameters of the optimizer, allowing it to operate reliably in a fixed and small number of iterations while completely preserving its interpretable operation. We show how power efficient beamforming can be encouraged by the learned optimizer, via boosting architectures with low-resolution phase shifts and with deactivated analog components. Numerical results show that our learn-to-optimize method notably reduces the number of iterations and computation latency required to reliably tune modular MIMO receivers, and that it allows obtaining desirable balances between power efficient designs and throughput.</description>

      <title>Reenact Anything: Semantic Video Motion Transfer Using Motion-Textual Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a tremendous improvement in the quality of video generation and editing approaches. While several techniques focus on editing appearance, few address motion. Current approaches using text, trajectories, or bounding boxes are limited to simple motions, so we specify motions with a single motion reference video instead. We further propose to use a pre-trained image-to-video model rather than a text-to-video model. This approach allows us to preserve the exact appearance and position of a target object or scene and helps disentangle appearance from motion. Our method, called motion-textual inversion, leverages our observation that image-to-video models extract appearance mainly from the (latent) image input, while the text/image embedding injected via cross-attention predominantly controls motion. We thus represent motion using text/image embedding tokens. By operating on an inflated motion-text embedding containing multiple text/image embedding tokens per frame, we achieve a high temporal motion granularity. Once optimized on the motion reference video, this embedding can be applied to various target images to generate videos with semantically similar motions. Our approach does not require spatial alignment between the motion reference video and target image, generalizes across various domains, and can be applied to various tasks such as full-body and face reenactment, as well as controlling the motion of inanimate objects and the camera. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the semantic video motion transfer task, significantly outperforming existing methods in this context.</description>

      <title>Designing Efficient LLM Accelerators for Edge Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increase in open-source availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled users to deploy them on more and more resource-constrained edge devices to reduce reliance on network connections and provide more privacy. However, the high computation and memory demands of LLMs make their execution on resource-constrained edge devices challenging and inefficient. To address this issue, designing new and efficient edge accelerators for LLM inference is crucial. FPGA-based accelerators are ideal for LLM acceleration due to their reconfigurability, as they enable model-specific optimizations and higher performance per watt. However, creating and integrating FPGA-based accelerators for LLMs (particularly on edge devices) has proven challenging, mainly due to the limited hardware design flows for LLMs in existing FPGA platforms.
  To tackle this issue, in this paper we first propose a new design platform, named SECDA-LLM, that utilizes the SECDA methodology to streamline the process of designing, integrating, and deploying efficient FPGA-based LLM accelerators for the llama.cpp inference framework. We then demonstrate, through a case study, the potential benefits of SECDA-LLM by creating a new MatMul accelerator that supports block floating point quantized operations for LLMs. Our initial accelerator design, deployed on the PYNQ-Z1 board, reduces latency 1.7 seconds per token or ~2 seconds per word) by 11x over the dual-core Arm NEON-based CPU execution for the TinyLlama model.</description>

      <title>Infrequent Resolving Algorithm for Online Linear Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online linear programming (OLP) has gained significant attention from both researchers and practitioners due to its extensive applications, such as online auction, network revenue management and advertising. Existing OLP algorithms fall into two categories: LP-based algorithms and LP-free algorithms. The former one typically guarantees better performance, even offering a constant regret, but requires solving a large number of LPs, which could be computationally expensive. In contrast, LP-free algorithm only requires first-order computations but induces a worse performance, lacking a constant regret bound. In this work, we bridge the gap between these two extremes by proposing an algorithm that achieves a constant regret while solving LPs only $O(\log\log T)$ times over the time horizon $T$. Moreover, when we are allowed to solve LPs only $M$ times, we propose an algorithm that can guarantee an $O\left(T^{(1/2+\epsilon)^{M-1}}\right)$ regret. Furthermore, when the arrival probabilities are known at the beginning, our algorithm can guarantee a constant regret by solving LPs $O(\log\log T)$ times, and an $O\left(T^{(1/2+\epsilon)^{M}}\right)$ regret by solving LPs only $M$ times. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</description>

However, most LLM-based agents focus on dialogue, programming, or specialized domains, leaving gaps in addressing generative AI safety tasks. These gaps are primarily due to the challenges posed by LLM hallucinations and the lack of clear guidelines. In this paper, we propose Atlas, an advanced LLM-based multi-agent framework that integrates an efficient fuzzing workflow to target generative AI models, specifically focusing on jailbreak attacks against text-to-image (T2I) models with safety filters. Atlas utilizes a vision-language model (VLM) to assess whether a prompt triggers the T2I model's safety filter. It then iteratively collaborates with both LLM and VLM to generate an alternative prompt that bypasses the filter. Atlas also enhances the reasoning abilities of LLMs in attack scenarios by leveraging multi-agent communication, in-context learning (ICL) memory mechanisms, and the chain-of-thought (COT) approach. Our evaluation demonstrates that Atlas successfully jailbreaks several state-of-the-art T2I models in a black-box setting, which are equipped with multi-modal safety filters. In addition, Atlas outperforms existing methods in both query efficiency and the quality of the generated images.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Hierarchical Emotional Areas in the Human Brain Through Information Fusion</title>

Abstract: The brain basis of emotion has consistently received widespread attention, attracting a large number of studies to explore this cutting-edge topic. However, the methods employed in these studies typically only model the pairwise relationship between two brain regions, while neglecting the interactions and information fusion among multiple brain regions$\unicode{x2014}$one of the key ideas of the psychological constructionist hypothesis. To overcome the limitations of traditional methods, this study provides an in-depth theoretical analysis of how to maximize interactions and information fusion among brain regions. Building on the results of this analysis, we propose to identify the hierarchical emotional areas in the human brain through multi-source information fusion and graph machine learning methods. Comprehensive experiments reveal that the identified hierarchical emotional areas, from lower to higher levels, primarily facilitate the fundamental process of emotion perception, the construction of basic psychological operations, and the coordination and integration of these operations. Overall, our findings provide unique insights into the brain mechanisms underlying specific emotions based on the psychological constructionist hypothesis.</description>

      <title>The Energy Cost of Artificial Intelligence of Things Lifecycle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)coupled with existing Internet of Things (IoT) enables more streamlined and autonomous operations across various economic sectors. Consequently, the paradigm of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) having AI techniques at its core implies additional energy and carbon costs that may become significant with more complex neural architectures. To better understand the energy and Carbon Footprint (CF) of some AIoT components, very recent studies employ conventional metrics. However, these metrics are not designed to capture energy efficiency aspects of inference. In this paper, we propose a new metric, the Energy Cost of AIoT Lifecycle (eCAL) to capture the overall energy cost of inference over the lifecycle of an AIoT system. We devise a new methodology for determining eCAL of an AIoT system by analyzing the complexity of data manipulation in individual components involved in the AIoT lifecycle and derive the overall and per bit energy consumption. With eCAL we show that the better a model is and the more it is used, the more energy efficient an inference is. For an example AIoT configuration, eCAL for making $100$ inferences is $1.43$ times higher than for $1000$ inferences. We also evaluate the CF of the AIoT system by calculating the equivalent CO$_{2}$ emissions based on the energy consumption and the Carbon Intensity (CI) across different countries. Using 2023 renewable data, our analysis reveals that deploying an AIoT system in Germany results in emitting $4.62$ times higher CO$_2$ than in Finland, due to latter using more low-CI energy sources.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Effectiveness of Quantum Annealing with Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of Quantum Computing has gathered significant popularity in recent years and a large number of papers have studied its effectiveness in tackling many tasks. We focus in particular on Quantum Annealing (QA), a meta-heuristic solver for Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. It is known that the effectiveness of QA is dependent on the task itself, as is the case for classical solvers, but there is not yet a clear understanding of which are the characteristics of a problem that makes it difficult to solve with QA. In this work, we propose a new methodology to study the effectiveness of QA based on meta-learning models. To do so, we first build a dataset composed of more than five thousand instances of ten different optimization problems. We define a set of more than a hundred features to describe their characteristics, and solve them with both QA and three classical solvers. We publish this dataset online for future research. Then, we train multiple meta-models to predict whether QA would solve that instance effectively and use them to probe which are the features with the strongest impact on the effectiveness of QA. Our results indicate that it is possible to accurately predict the effectiveness of QA, validating our methodology. Furthermore, we observe that the distribution of the problem coefficients representing the bias and coupling terms is very informative to identify the probability of finding good solutions, while the density of these coefficients alone is not enough. The methodology we propose allows to open new research directions to further our understanding of the effectiveness of QA, by probing specific dimensions or by developing new QUBO formulations that are better suited for the particular nature of QA. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is flexible and can be extended or used to study other quantum or classical solvers.</description>

      <title>Using CSNNs to Perform Event-based Data Processing &amp; Classification on ASL-DVS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in bio-inspired visual sensing and neuromorphic computing have led to the development of various highly efficient bio-inspired solutions with real-world applications. One notable application integrates event-based cameras with spiking neural networks (SNNs) to process event-based sequences that are asynchronous and sparse, making them difficult to handle. In this project, we develop a convolutional spiking neural network (CSNN) architecture that leverages convolutional operations and recurrent properties of a spiking neuron to learn the spatial and temporal relations in the ASL-DVS gesture dataset. The ASL-DVS gesture dataset is a neuromorphic dataset containing hand gestures when displaying 24 letters (A to Y, excluding J and Z due to the nature of their symbols) from the American Sign Language (ASL). We performed classification on a pre-processed subset of the full ASL-DVS dataset to identify letter signs and achieved 100\% training accuracy. Specifically, this was achieved by training in the Google Cloud compute platform while using a learning rate of 0.0005, batch size of 25 (total of 20 batches), 200 iterations, and 10 epochs.</description>

      <title>Aligning Multiple Knowledge Graphs in a Single Pass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entity alignment (EA) is to identify equivalent entities across different knowledge graphs (KGs), which can help fuse these KGs into a more comprehensive one. Previous EA methods mainly focus on aligning a pair of KGs, and to the best of our knowledge, no existing EA method considers aligning multiple (more than two) KGs. To fill this research gap, in this work, we study a novel problem of aligning multiple KGs and propose an effective framework named MultiEA to solve the problem. First, we embed the entities of all the candidate KGs into a common feature space by a shared KG encoder. Then, we explore three alignment strategies to minimize the distances among pre-aligned entities. In particular, we propose an innovative inference enhancement technique to improve the alignment performance by incorporating high-order similarities. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of MultiEA, we construct two new real-world benchmark datasets and conduct extensive experiments on them. The results show that our MultiEA can effectively and efficiently align multiple KGs in a single pass.</description>

      <title>ChordSync: Conformer-Based Alignment of Chord Annotations to Music Audio</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Western music tradition, chords are the main constituent components of harmony, a fundamental dimension of music. Despite its relevance for several Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks, chord-annotated audio datasets are limited and need more diversity. One way to improve those resources is to leverage the large number of chord annotations available online, but this requires aligning them with music audio. However, existing audio-to-score alignment techniques, which typically rely on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), fail to address this challenge, as they require weakly aligned data for precise synchronisation. In this paper, we introduce ChordSync, a novel conformer-based model designed to seamlessly align chord annotations with audio, eliminating the need for weak alignment. We also provide a pre-trained model and a user-friendly library, enabling users to synchronise chord annotations with audio tracks effortlessly. In this way, ChordSync creates opportunities for harnessing crowd-sourced chord data for MIR, especially in audio chord estimation, thereby facilitating the generation of novel datasets. Additionally, our system extends its utility to music education, enhancing music learning experiences by providing accurately aligned annotations, thus enabling learners to engage in synchronised musical practices.</description>

      <title>Alpha-VI DeepONet: A prior-robust variational Bayesian approach for enhancing DeepONets with uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel deep operator network (DeepONet) framework that incorporates generalised variational inference (GVI) using R\'enyi's $\alpha$-divergence to learn complex operators while quantifying uncertainty. By incorporating Bayesian neural networks as the building blocks for the branch and trunk networks, our framework endows DeepONet with uncertainty quantification. The use of R\'enyi's $\alpha$-divergence, instead of the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD), commonly used in standard variational inference, mitigates issues related to prior misspecification that are prevalent in Variational Bayesian DeepONets. This approach offers enhanced flexibility and robustness. We demonstrate that modifying the variational objective function yields superior results in terms of minimising the mean squared error and improving the negative log-likelihood on the test set. Our framework's efficacy is validated across various mechanical systems, where it outperforms both deterministic and standard KLD-based VI DeepONets in predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification. The hyperparameter $\alpha$, which controls the degree of robustness, can be tuned to optimise performance for specific problems. We apply this approach to a range of mechanics problems, including gravity pendulum, advection-diffusion, and diffusion-reaction systems. Our findings underscore the potential of $\alpha$-VI DeepONet to advance the field of data-driven operator learning and its applications in engineering and scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Point-supervised Brain Tumor Segmentation with Box-prompted MedSAM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Delineating lesions and anatomical structure is important for image-guided interventions. Point-supervised medical image segmentation (PSS) has great potential to alleviate costly expert delineation labeling. However, due to the lack of precise size and boundary guidance, the effectiveness of PSS often falls short of expectations. Although recent vision foundational models, such as the medical segment anything model (MedSAM), have made significant advancements in bounding-box-prompted segmentation, it is not straightforward to utilize point annotation, and is prone to semantic ambiguity. In this preliminary study, we introduce an iterative framework to facilitate semantic-aware point-supervised MedSAM. Specifically, the semantic box-prompt generator (SBPG) module has the capacity to convert the point input into potential pseudo bounding box suggestions, which are explicitly refined by the prototype-based semantic similarity. This is then succeeded by a prompt-guided spatial refinement (PGSR) module that harnesses the exceptional generalizability of MedSAM to infer the segmentation mask, which also updates the box proposal seed in SBPG. Performance can be progressively improved with adequate iterations. We conducted an evaluation on BraTS2018 for the segmentation of whole brain tumors and demonstrated its superior performance compared to traditional PSS methods and on par with box-supervised methods.</description>

      <title>Synthetic dual image generation for reduction of labeling efforts in semantic segmentation of micrographs with a customized metric function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training of semantic segmentation models for material analysis requires micrographs and their corresponding masks. It is quite unlikely that perfect masks will be drawn, especially at the edges of objects, and sometimes the amount of data that can be obtained is small, since only a few samples are available. These aspects make it very problematic to train a robust model. We demonstrate a workflow for the improvement of semantic segmentation models of micrographs through the generation of synthetic microstructural images in conjunction with masks. The workflow only requires joining a few micrographs with their respective masks to create the input for a Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder model that includes an embedding space, which is trained such that a generative model (PixelCNN) learns the distribution of each input, transformed into discrete codes, and can be used to sample new codes. The latter will eventually be decoded by VQ-VAE to generate images alongside corresponding masks for semantic segmentation. To evaluate the synthetic data, we have trained U-Net models with different amounts of these synthetic data in conjunction with real data. These models were then evaluated using non-synthetic images only. Additionally, we introduce a customized metric derived from the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU). The proposed metric prevents a few falsely predicted pixels from greatly reducing the value of the mIoU. We have achieved a reduction in sample preparation and acquisition times, as well as the efforts, needed for image processing and labeling tasks, are less when it comes to training semantic segmentation model. The approach could be generalized to various types of image data such that it serves as a user-friendly solution for training models with a small number of real images.</description>

Abstract: We present Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), a foundation model towards solving promptable visual segmentation in images and videos. We build a data engine, which improves model and data via user interaction, to collect the largest video segmentation dataset to date. Our model is a simple transformer architecture with streaming memory for real-time video processing. SAM 2 trained on our data provides strong performance across a wide range of tasks. In video segmentation, we observe better accuracy, using 3x fewer interactions than prior approaches. In image segmentation, our model is more accurate and 6x faster than the Segment Anything Model (SAM). We believe that our data, model, and insights will serve as a significant milestone for video segmentation and related perception tasks. We are releasing a version of our model, the dataset and an interactive demo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing integration of AI in daily life, ensuring the robustness of systems to inference-time attacks is crucial. Among the approaches for certifying robustness to such adversarial examples, randomized smoothing has emerged as highly promising due to its nature as a wrapper around arbitrary black-box models. Previous work on randomized smoothing in natural language processing has primarily focused on specific subsets of edit distance operations, such as synonym substitution or word insertion, without exploring the certification of all edit operations. In this paper, we adapt Randomized Deletion (Huang et al., 2023) and propose, CERTified Edit Distance defense (CERT-ED) for natural language classification. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that CERT-ED outperforms the existing Hamming distance method RanMASK (Zeng et al., 2023) in 4 out of 5 datasets in terms of both accuracy and the cardinality of the certificate. By covering various threat models, including 5 direct and 5 transfer attacks, our method improves empirical robustness in 38 out of 50 settings.</description>

      <title>Leaf Angle Estimation using Mask R-CNN and LETR Vision Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern day studies show a high degree of correlation between high yielding crop varieties and plants with upright leaf angles. It is observed that plants with upright leaf angles intercept more light than those without upright leaf angles, leading to a higher rate of photosynthesis. Plant scientists and breeders benefit from tools that can directly measure plant parameters in the field i.e. on-site phenotyping. The estimation of leaf angles by manual means in a field setting is tedious and cumbersome. We mitigate the tedium using a combination of the Mask R-CNN instance segmentation neural network, and Line Segment Transformer (LETR), a vision transformer. The proposed Computer Vision (CV) pipeline is applied on two image datasets, Summer 2015-Ames ULA and Summer 2015- Ames MLA, with a combined total of 1,827 plant images collected in the field using FieldBook, an Android application aimed at on-site phenotyping. The leaf angles estimated by the proposed pipeline on the image datasets are compared to two independent manual measurements using ImageJ, a Java-based image processing program developed at the National Institutes of Health and the Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation. The results, when compared for similarity using the Cosine Similarity measure, exhibit 0.98 similarity scores on both independent measurements of Summer 2015-Ames ULA and Summer 2015-Ames MLA image datasets, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed pipeline for on-site measurement of leaf angles.</description>

      <title>A Policy-Gradient Approach to Solving Imperfect-Information Games with Iterate Convergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policy gradient methods have become a staple of any single-agent reinforcement learning toolbox, due to their combination of desirable properties: iterate convergence, efficient use of stochastic trajectory feedback, and theoretically-sound avoidance of importance sampling corrections. In multi-agent imperfect-information settings (extensive-form games), however, it is still unknown whether the same desiderata can be guaranteed while retaining theoretical guarantees. Instead, sound methods for extensive-form games rely on approximating counterfactual values (as opposed to Q values), which are incompatible with policy gradient methodologies. In this paper, we investigate whether policy gradient can be safely used in two-player zero-sum imperfect-information extensive-form games (EFGs). We establish positive results, showing for the first time that a policy gradient method leads to provable best-iterate convergence to a regularized Nash equilibrium in self-play.</description>

      <title>Coarse Correspondence Elicit 3D Spacetime Understanding in Multimodal Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly being implemented in real-world environments, necessitating their ability to interpret 3D spaces and comprehend temporal dynamics. Despite their potential, current top models within our community still fall short in adequately understanding spatial and temporal dimensions. We introduce Coarse Correspondence, a simple, training-free, effective, and general-purpose visual prompting method to elicit 3D and temporal understanding in multimodal LLMs. Our method uses a lightweight tracking model to find object correspondences between frames in a video or between sets of image viewpoints. It selects the most frequent object instances and visualizes them with markers with unique IDs in the image. With this simple approach, we achieve state-of-the-art results on 3D understanding benchmarks including ScanQA (+20.5\%) and a subset of OpenEQA (+9.7\%), and on long-form video benchmarks such as EgoSchema (+6.0\%). We also curate a small diagnostic dataset to evaluate whether MLLMs can reason about space from a described viewpoint other than the camera viewpoint. Again, Coarse Correspondence improves spatial perspective-taking abilities but we highlight that MLLMs struggle with this task. Together, we demonstrate that our simple prompting method can significantly aid downstream tasks that require 3D or temporal reasoning.</description>

      <title>Smoothed Energy Guidance: Guiding Diffusion Models with Reduced Energy Curvature of Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have shown remarkable success in visual content generation, producing high-quality samples across various domains, largely due to classifier-free guidance (CFG). Recent attempts to extend guidance to unconditional models have relied on heuristic techniques, resulting in suboptimal generation quality and unintended effects. In this work, we propose Smoothed Energy Guidance (SEG), a novel training- and condition-free approach that leverages the energy-based perspective of the self-attention mechanism to enhance image generation. By defining the energy of self-attention, we introduce a method to reduce the curvature of the energy landscape of attention and use the output as the unconditional prediction. Practically, we control the curvature of the energy landscape by adjusting the Gaussian kernel parameter while keeping the guidance scale parameter fixed. Additionally, we present a query blurring method that is equivalent to blurring the entire attention weights without incurring quadratic complexity in the number of tokens. In our experiments, SEG achieves a Pareto improvement in both quality and the reduction of side effects. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/SusungHong/SEG-SDXL}.</description>

      <title>AgentGen: Enhancing Planning Abilities for Large Language Model based Agent via Environment and Task Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based agents have garnered significant attention and are becoming increasingly popular. Furthermore, planning ability is a crucial component of an LLM-based agent, involving interaction with the environment and executing actions to complete a planning task, which generally entails achieving a desired goal from an initial state. This paper investigates enhancing the planning abilities of LLMs through instruction tuning, referred to as agent training. Recent studies have demonstrated that utilizing expert-level trajectory for instruction-tuning LLMs effectively enhances their planning capabilities. However, existing work primarily focuses on synthesizing trajectories from manually designed planning tasks and environments. The labor-intensive nature of creating these environments and tasks impedes the generation of sufficiently varied and extensive trajectories. To address this limitation, this paper explores the automated synthesis of diverse environments and a gradual range of planning tasks, from easy to difficult. We introduce a framework, AgentGen, that leverages LLMs first to generate environments and subsequently generate planning tasks conditioned on these environments. Specifically, to improve environmental diversity, we propose using an inspiration corpus composed of various domain-specific text segments as the context for synthesizing environments. Moreover, to increase the difficulty diversity of generated planning tasks, we propose a bidirectional evolution method, Bi-Evol, that evolves planning tasks from easier and harder directions to synthesize a task set with a smoother difficulty curve. The evaluation results derived from AgentBoard show that AgentGen greatly improves LLMs' planning ability, e.g., the AgentGen instruction-tuned Llama-3 8B surpasses GPT-3.5 in overall performance. Moreover, in certain tasks, it even outperforms GPT-4.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Projected Bellman Error for Off-policy Value Estimation in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.13844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many reinforcement learning algorithms rely on value estimation, however, the most widely used algorithms -- namely temporal difference algorithms -- can diverge under both off-policy sampling and nonlinear function approximation. Many algorithms have been developed for off-policy value estimation based on the linear mean squared projected Bellman error (MSPBE) and are sound under linear function approximation. Extending these methods to the nonlinear case has been largely unsuccessful. Recently, several methods have been introduced that approximate a different objective -- the mean-squared Bellman error (MSBE) -- which naturally facilitate nonlinear approximation. In this work, we build on these insights and introduce a new generalized MSPBE that extends the linear MSPBE to the nonlinear setting. We show how this generalized objective unifies previous work and obtain new bounds for the value error of the solutions of the generalized objective. We derive an easy-to-use, but sound, algorithm to minimize the generalized objective, and show that it is more stable across runs, is less sensitive to hyperparameters, and performs favorably across four control domains with neural network function approximation.</description>

      <title>From Unsupervised to Few-shot Graph Anomaly Detection: A Multi-scale Contrastive Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.05525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomaly detection from graph data is an important data mining task in many applications such as social networks, finance, and e-commerce. Existing efforts in graph anomaly detection typically only consider the information in a single scale (view), thus inevitably limiting their capability in capturing anomalous patterns in complex graph data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, graph ANomaly dEtection framework with Multi-scale cONtrastive lEarning (ANEMONE in short). By using a graph neural network as a backbone to encode the information from multiple graph scales (views), we learn better representation for nodes in a graph. In maximizing the agreements between instances at both the patch and context levels concurrently, we estimate the anomaly score of each node with a statistical anomaly estimator according to the degree of agreement from multiple perspectives. To further exploit a handful of ground-truth anomalies (few-shot anomalies) that may be collected in real-life applications, we further propose an extended algorithm, ANEMONE-FS, to integrate valuable information in our method. We conduct extensive experiments under purely unsupervised settings and few-shot anomaly detection settings, and we demonstrate that the proposed method ANEMONE and its variant ANEMONE-FS consistently outperform state-of-the-art algorithms on six benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Generalization in Neural Networks: A Broad Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.01610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reviews concepts, modeling approaches, and recent findings along a spectrum of different levels of abstraction of neural network models including generalization across (1) Samples, (2) Distributions, (3) Domains, (4) Tasks, (5) Modalities, and (6) Scopes. Strategies for (1) sample generalization from training to test data are discussed, with suggestive evidence presented that, at least for the ImageNet dataset, popular classification models show substantial overfitting. An empirical example and perspectives from statistics highlight how models' (2) distribution generalization can benefit from consideration of causal relationships and counterfactual scenarios. Transfer learning approaches and results for (3) domain generalization are summarized, as is the wealth of domain generalization benchmark datasets available. Recent breakthroughs surveyed in (4) task generalization include few-shot meta-learning approaches and the emergence of transformer-based foundation models such as those used for language processing. Studies performing (5) modality generalization are reviewed, including those that integrate image and text data and that apply a biologically-inspired network across olfactory, visual, and auditory modalities. Higher-level (6) scope generalization results are surveyed, including graph-based approaches to represent symbolic knowledge in networks and attribution strategies for improving networks' explainability. Additionally, concepts from neuroscience are discussed on the modular architecture of brains and the steps by which dopamine-driven conditioning leads to abstract thinking.</description>

      <title>Tiered Reward: Designing Rewards for Specification and Fast Learning of Desired Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement-learning agents seek to maximize a reward signal through environmental interactions. As humans, our job in the learning process is to design reward functions to express desired behavior and enable the agent to learn such behavior swiftly. However, designing good reward functions to induce the desired behavior is generally hard, let alone the question of which rewards make learning fast. In this work, we introduce a family of a reward structures we call Tiered Reward that addresses both of these questions. We consider the reward-design problem in tasks formulated as reaching desirable states and avoiding undesirable states. To start, we propose a strict partial ordering of the policy space to resolve trade-offs in behavior preference. We prefer policies that reach the good states faster and with higher probability while avoiding the bad states longer. Next, we introduce Tiered Reward, a class of environment-independent reward functions and show it is guaranteed to induce policies that are Pareto-optimal according to our preference relation. Finally, we demonstrate that Tiered Reward leads to fast learning with multiple tabular and deep reinforcement-learning algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.10717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce camouflaged data poisoning attacks, a new attack vector that arises in the context of machine unlearning and other settings when model retraining may be induced. An adversary first adds a few carefully crafted points to the training dataset such that the impact on the model's predictions is minimal. The adversary subsequently triggers a request to remove a subset of the introduced points at which point the attack is unleashed and the model's predictions are negatively affected. In particular, we consider clean-label targeted attacks (in which the goal is to cause the model to misclassify a specific test point) on datasets including CIFAR-10, Imagenette, and Imagewoof. This attack is realized by constructing camouflage datapoints that mask the effect of a poisoned dataset.</description>

      <title>A Finite Sample Complexity Bound for Distributionally Robust Q-learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13203v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a reinforcement learning setting in which the deployment environment is different from the training environment. Applying a robust Markov decision processes formulation, we extend the distributionally robust $Q$-learning framework studied in Liu et al. [2022]. Further, we improve the design and analysis of their multi-level Monte Carlo estimator. Assuming access to a simulator, we prove that the worst-case expected sample complexity of our algorithm to learn the optimal robust $Q$-function within an $\epsilon$ error in the sup norm is upper bounded by $\tilde O(|S||A|(1-\gamma)^{-5}\epsilon^{-2}p_{\wedge}^{-6}\delta^{-4})$, where $\gamma$ is the discount rate, $p_{\wedge}$ is the non-zero minimal support probability of the transition kernels and $\delta$ is the uncertainty size. This is the first sample complexity result for the model-free robust RL problem. Simulation studies further validate our theoretical results.</description>

Abstract: In this technical note, we aim to explain a deep neural network (DNN) by quantifying the encoded interactions between input variables, which reflects the DNN's inference logic. Specifically, we first rethink the definition of interactions, and then formally define faithfulness and conciseness for interaction-based explanation. To this end, we propose two kinds of interactions, i.e., the AND interaction and the OR interaction. For faithfulness, we prove the uniqueness of the AND (OR) interaction in quantifying the effect of the AND (OR) relationship between input variables. Besides, based on AND-OR interactions, we design techniques to boost the conciseness of the explanation, while not hurting the faithfulness. In this way, the inference logic of a DNN can be faithfully and concisely explained by a set of symbolic concepts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01674v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Economic) nonlinear model predictive control ((e)NMPC) requires dynamic models that are sufficiently accurate and computationally tractable. Data-driven surrogate models for mechanistic models can reduce the computational burden of (e)NMPC; however, such models are typically trained by system identification for maximum prediction accuracy on simulation samples and perform suboptimally in (e)NMPC. We present a method for end-to-end reinforcement learning of Koopman surrogate models for optimal performance as part of (e)NMPC. We apply our method to two applications derived from an established nonlinear continuous stirred-tank reactor model. The controller performance is compared to that of (e)NMPCs utilizing models trained using system identification, and model-free neural network controllers trained using reinforcement learning. We show that the end-to-end trained models outperform those trained using system identification in (e)NMPC, and that, in contrast to the neural network controllers, the (e)NMPC controllers can react to changes in the control setting without retraining.</description>

      <title>Understanding Vector-Valued Neural Networks and Their Relationship with Real and Hypercomplex-Valued Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the many successful applications of deep learning models for multidimensional signal and image processing, most traditional neural networks process data represented by (multidimensional) arrays of real numbers. The intercorrelation between feature channels is usually expected to be learned from the training data, requiring numerous parameters and careful training. In contrast, vector-valued neural networks are conceived to process arrays of vectors and naturally consider the intercorrelation between feature channels. Consequently, they usually have fewer parameters and often undergo more robust training than traditional neural networks. This paper aims to present a broad framework for vector-valued neural networks, referred to as V-nets. In this context, hypercomplex-valued neural networks are regarded as vector-valued models with additional algebraic properties. Furthermore, this paper explains the relationship between vector-valued and traditional neural networks. Precisely, a vector-valued neural network can be obtained by placing restrictions on a real-valued model to consider the intercorrelation between feature channels. Finally, we show how V-nets, including hypercomplex-valued neural networks, can be implemented in current deep-learning libraries as real-valued networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In unsupervised causal representation learning for sequential data with time-delayed latent causal influences, strong identifiability results for the disentanglement of causally-related latent variables have been established in stationary settings by leveraging temporal structure. However, in nonstationary setting, existing work only partially addressed the problem by either utilizing observed auxiliary variables (e.g., class labels and/or domain indexes) as side information or assuming simplified latent causal dynamics. Both constrain the method to a limited range of scenarios. In this study, we further explored the Markov Assumption under time-delayed causally related process in nonstationary setting and showed that under mild conditions, the independent latent components can be recovered from their nonlinear mixture up to a permutation and a component-wise transformation, without the observation of auxiliary variables. We then introduce NCTRL, a principled estimation framework, to reconstruct time-delayed latent causal variables and identify their relations from measured sequential data only. Empirical evaluations demonstrated the reliable identification of time-delayed latent causal influences, with our methodology substantially outperforming existing baselines that fail to exploit the nonstationarity adequately and then, consequently, cannot distinguish distribution shifts.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Contrastive Multimodal Learning for Advancing Chemical Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06456v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The versatility of multimodal deep learning holds tremendous promise for advancing scientific research and practical applications. As this field continues to evolve, the collective power of cross-modal analysis promises to drive transformative innovations, leading us to new frontiers in chemical understanding and discovery. Hence, we introduce Asymmetric Contrastive Multimodal Learning (ACML) as a novel approach tailored for molecules, showcasing its potential to advance the field of chemistry. ACML harnesses the power of effective asymmetric contrastive learning to seamlessly transfer information from various chemical modalities to molecular graph representations. By combining pre-trained chemical unimodal encoders and a shallow-designed graph encoder, ACML facilitates the assimilation of coordinated chemical semantics from different modalities, leading to comprehensive representation learning with efficient training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework through large-scale cross-modality retrieval and isomer discrimination tasks. Additionally, ACML enhances interpretability by revealing chemical semantics in graph presentations and bolsters the expressive power of graph neural networks, as evidenced by improved performance in molecular property prediction tasks from MoleculeNet. ACML exhibits its capability to revolutionize chemical research and applications, providing a deeper understanding of the chemical semantics of different modalities.</description>

      <title>HiMTM: Hierarchical Multi-Scale Masked Time Series Modeling with Self-Distillation for Long-Term Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical and challenging task in practical application. Recent advancements in pre-trained foundation models for time series forecasting have gained significant interest. However, current methods often overlook the multi-scale nature of time series, which is essential for accurate forecasting. To address this, we propose HiMTM, a hierarchical multi-scale masked time series modeling with self-distillation for long-term forecasting. HiMTM integrates four key components: (1) hierarchical multi-scale transformer (HMT) to capture temporal information at different scales; (2) decoupled encoder-decoder (DED) that directs the encoder towards feature extraction while the decoder focuses on pretext tasks; (3) hierarchical self-distillation (HSD) for multi-stage feature-level supervision signals during pre-training; and (4) cross-scale attention fine-tuning (CSA-FT) to capture dependencies between different scales for downstream tasks. These components collectively enhance multi-scale feature extraction in masked time series modeling, improving forecasting accuracy. Extensive experiments on seven mainstream datasets show that HiMTM surpasses state-of-the-art self-supervised and end-to-end learning methods by a considerable margin of 3.16-68.54\%. Additionally, HiMTM outperforms the latest robust self-supervised learning method, PatchTST, in cross-domain forecasting by a significant margin of 2.3\%. The effectiveness of HiMTM is further demonstrated through its application in natural gas demand forecasting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents MoE-Infinity, an offloading-efficient serving system for sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) models. To optimize offloading, MoE-Infinity achieves novel request-level tracing for expert activation, capturing MoE's sparse execution patterns such as selective activation, group activation, and skewed reuse. Leveraging the request-level trace, MoE-Infinity performs effective expert prefetching and expert caching, achieving high efficiency in transferring model parameters from host memory to GPU memory. Experimental results demonstrate that MoE-Infinity achieves low latency comparable to expensive full-GPU deployments, which require up to 4X more GPU resources than MoE-Infinity. Compared to offloading-supporting LLM serving systems such as DeepSpeed-Inference, Llama.cpp, Mixtral Offloading, and BrainStorm, MoE-Infinity exhibits superior latency performance, providing 2-20X improvements when serving various MoE models for a large collection of LLM tasks.

      <title>Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling</title>

Abstract: Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across fields ranging from medical devices to robotics. These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements). While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors. These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift. For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment. In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction. HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy. Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE. Our experiments further indicate that HiSS demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing data-filtering techniques.

      <title>ChunkAttention: Efficient Self-Attention with Prefix-Aware KV Cache and Two-Phase Partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15220v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-attention is an essential component of large language models (LLM) but a significant source of inference latency for long sequences. In multi-tenant LLM serving scenarios, the compute and memory operation cost of self-attention can be optimized by using the probability that multiple LLM requests have shared system prompts in prefixes. In this paper, we introduce ChunkAttention, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache. This is achieved by breaking monolithic key/value tensors into smaller chunks and structuring them into the auxiliary prefix tree. Consequently, on top of the prefix-tree based KV cache, we design an efficient self-attention kernel, where a two-phase partition algorithm is implemented to improve the data locality during self-attention computation in the presence of shared system prompts. Experiments show that ChunkAttention can speed up the self-attention kernel by 3.2-4.8$\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art implementation, with the length of the system prompt ranging from 1024 to 4096.</description>

Abstract: In noisy and low-data regimes prevalent in real-world applications, a key challenge of machine learning lies in effectively incorporating inductive biases that promote data efficiency and robustness. Meta-learning and informed ML stand out as two approaches for incorporating prior knowledge into ML pipelines. While the former relies on a purely data-driven source of priors, the latter is guided by prior domain knowledge. In this paper, we formalise a hybrid paradigm, informed meta-learning, facilitating the incorporation of priors from unstructured knowledge representations, such as natural language; thus, unlocking complementarity in cross-task knowledge sharing of humans and machines. We establish the foundational components of informed meta-learning and present a concrete instantiation of this framework--the Informed Neural Process. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the potential benefits of informed meta-learning in improving data efficiency, robustness to observational noise and task distribution shifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05385v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose training fitted Q-iteration with log-loss (FQI-log) for batch reinforcement learning (RL). We show that the number of samples needed to learn a near-optimal policy with FQI-log scales with the accumulated cost of the optimal policy, which is zero in problems where acting optimally achieves the goal and incurs no cost. In doing so, we provide a general framework for proving small-cost bounds, i.e. bounds that scale with the optimal achievable cost, in batch RL. Moreover, we empirically verify that FQI-log uses fewer samples than FQI trained with squared loss on problems where the optimal policy reliably achieves the goal.</description>

Abstract: Designing control policies for stabilization tasks with provable guarantees is a long-standing problem in nonlinear control. A crucial performance metric is the size of the resulting region of attraction, which essentially serves as a robustness "margin" of the closed-loop system against uncertainties. In this paper, we propose a new method to train a stabilizing neural network controller along with its corresponding Lyapunov certificate, aiming to maximize the resulting region of attraction while respecting the actuation constraints. Crucial to our approach is the use of Zubov's Partial Differential Equation (PDE), which precisely characterizes the true region of attraction of a given control policy. Our framework follows an actor-critic pattern where we alternate between improving the control policy (actor) and learning a Zubov function (critic). Finally, we compute the largest certifiable region of attraction by invoking an SMT solver after the training procedure. Our numerical experiments on several design problems show consistent and significant improvements in the size of the resulting region of attraction.</description>

      <title>Graph neural network-based surrogate modelling for real-time hydraulic prediction of urban drainage networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-based models are computationally time-consuming and infeasible for real-time scenarios of urban drainage networks, and a surrogate model is needed to accelerate the online predictive modelling. Fully-connected neural networks (NNs) are potential surrogate models, but may suffer from low interpretability and efficiency in fitting complex targets. Owing to the state-of-the-art modelling power of graph neural networks (GNNs) and their match with urban drainage networks in the graph structure, this work proposes a GNN-based surrogate of the flow routing model for the hydraulic prediction problem of drainage networks, which regards recent hydraulic states as initial conditions, and future runoff and control policy as boundary conditions. To incorporate hydraulic constraints and physical relationships into drainage modelling, physics-guided mechanisms are designed on top of the surrogate model to restrict the prediction variables with flow balance and flooding occurrence constraints. According to case results in a stormwater network, the GNN-based model is more cost-effective with better hydraulic prediction accuracy than the NN-based model after equal training epochs, and the designed mechanisms further limit prediction errors with interpretable domain knowledge. As the model structure adheres to the flow routing mechanisms and hydraulic constraints in urban drainage networks, it provides an interpretable and effective solution for data-driven surrogate modelling. Simultaneously, the surrogate model accelerates the predictive modelling of urban drainage networks for real-time use compared with the physics-based model.</description>

      <title>Transformers Learn Temporal Difference Methods for In-Context Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13861v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-context learning refers to the learning ability of a model during inference time without adapting its parameters. The input (i.e., prompt) to the model (e.g., transformers) consists of both a context (i.e., instance-label pairs) and a query instance. The model is then able to output a label for the query instance according to the context during inference. A possible explanation for in-context learning is that the forward pass of (linear) transformers implements iterations of gradient descent on the instance-label pairs in the context. In this paper, we prove by construction that transformers can also implement temporal difference (TD) learning in the forward pass, a phenomenon we refer to as in-context TD. We demonstrate the emergence of in-context TD after training the transformer with a multi-task TD algorithm, accompanied by theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we prove that transformers are expressive enough to implement many other policy evaluation algorithms in the forward pass, including residual gradient, TD with eligibility trace, and average-reward TD.</description>

Abstract: Generative models on discrete state-spaces have a wide range of potential applications, particularly in the domain of natural sciences. In continuous state-spaces, controllable and flexible generation of samples with desired properties has been realized using guidance on diffusion and flow models. However, these guidance approaches are not readily amenable to discrete state-space models. Consequently, we introduce a general and principled method for applying guidance on such models. Our method depends on leveraging continuous-time Markov processes on discrete state-spaces, which unlocks computational tractability for sampling from a desired guided distribution. We demonstrate the utility of our approach, Discrete Guidance, on a range of applications including guided generation of images, small-molecules, DNA sequences and protein sequences.</description>

      <title>Towards Physically Consistent Deep Learning For Climate Model Parameterizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Climate models play a critical role in understanding and projecting climate change. Due to their complexity, their horizontal resolution of about 40-100 km remains too coarse to resolve processes such as clouds and convection, which need to be approximated via parameterizations. These parameterizations are a major source of systematic errors and large uncertainties in climate projections. Deep learning (DL)-based parameterizations, trained on data from computationally expensive short, high-resolution simulations, have shown great promise for improving climate models in that regard. However, their lack of interpretability and tendency to learn spurious non-physical correlations result in reduced trust in the climate simulation. We propose an efficient supervised learning framework for DL-based parameterizations that leads to physically consistent models with improved interpretability and negligible computational overhead compared to standard supervised training. First, key features determining the target physical processes are uncovered. Subsequently, the neural network is fine-tuned using only those relevant features. We show empirically that our method robustly identifies a small subset of the inputs as actual physical drivers, therefore, removing spurious non-physical relationships. This results in by design physically consistent and interpretable neural networks while maintaining the predictive performance of unconstrained black-box DL-based parameterizations.</description>

Abstract: Information extraction tasks require both accurate, efficient, and generalisable models. Classical supervised deep learning approaches can achieve the required performance, but they need large datasets and are limited in their ability to adapt to different tasks. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate good generalization, meaning that they can adapt to many different tasks based on user requests. However, LLMs are computationally expensive and tend to fail to generate structured outputs. In this article, we will introduce a new kind of GLiNER model that can be used for various information extraction tasks while being a small encoder model. Our model achieved SoTA performance on zero-shot NER benchmarks and leading performance on question-answering, summarization and relation extraction tasks. Additionally, in this article, we will cover experimental results on self-learning approaches for named entity recognition using GLiNER models.</description>

Abstract: Training extremely large language models with billions of parameters is a computationally intensive task that pushes the limits of current data parallel training systems. While techniques like ZeRO++ have enabled efficient distributed training of such giant models on inexpensive low-bandwidth clusters, they can suffer from convergence issues due to potential race conditions in the hierarchical partitioning (hpZ) scheme employed to reduce cross-machine communication. In this work, we first show how these race conditions cause instability when training models with billions of parameters. We then propose a modification to the partitioning algorithm that addresses these convergence challenges while maintaining competitive training efficiency. Empirical evaluation on training the multi-billion parameters Falcon Models and Llama-2 models demonstrates the updated algorithm's ability to achieve reliable convergence on these massive models, where stock ZeRO++ hpZ fails to converge. The updated algorithm enables robust training of larger models with 98\% throughput and model training speed improvement without sacrificing the quality of convergence.</description>

Abstract: In machine learning ensembles predictions from multiple models are aggregated. Despite widespread use and strong performance of ensembles in applied problems little is known about the mathematical properties of aggregating models and associated consequences for safe, explainable use of such models. In this paper we prove a theorem that shows that any ensemble will exhibit at least one of the following forms of prediction instability. It will either ignore agreement among all underlying models, change its mind when none of the underlying models have done so, or be manipulable through inclusion or exclusion of options it would never actually predict. As a consequence, ensemble aggregation procedures will always need to balance the benefits of information use against the risk of these prediction instabilities. This analysis also sheds light on what specific forms of prediction instability to expect from particular ensemble algorithms; for example popular tree ensembles like random forest, or xgboost will violate basic, intuitive fairness properties. Finally, we show that this can be ameliorated by using consistent models in asymptotic conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review introduces the transformative potential of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and foundation models, including large language models (LLMs), for health technology assessment (HTA). We explore their applications in four critical areas, evidence synthesis, evidence generation, clinical trials and economic modeling: (1) Evidence synthesis: Generative AI has the potential to assist in automating literature reviews and meta-analyses by proposing search terms, screening abstracts, and extracting data with notable accuracy; (2) Evidence generation: These models can potentially facilitate automating the process and analyze the increasingly available large collections of real-world data (RWD), including unstructured clinical notes and imaging, enhancing the speed and quality of real-world evidence (RWE) generation; (3) Clinical trials: Generative AI can be used to optimize trial design, improve patient matching, and manage trial data more efficiently; and (4) Economic modeling: Generative AI can also aid in the development of health economic models, from conceptualization to validation, thus streamlining the overall HTA process. Despite their promise, these technologies, while rapidly improving, are still nascent and continued careful evaluation in their applications to HTA is required. To ensure their responsible use and implementation, both developers and users of research incorporating these tools, should familiarize themselves with their current limitations, including the issues related to scientific validity, risk of bias, and consider equity and ethical implications. We also surveyed the current policy landscape and provide suggestions for HTA agencies on responsibly integrating generative AI into their workflows, emphasizing the importance of human oversight and the fast-evolving nature of these tools.</description>

      <title>COKE: Causal Discovery with Chronological Order and Expert Knowledge in High Proportion of Missing Manufacturing Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding causal relationships between machines is crucial for fault diagnosis and optimization in manufacturing processes. Real-world datasets frequently exhibit up to 90% missing data and high dimensionality from hundreds of sensors. These datasets also include domain-specific expert knowledge and chronological order information, reflecting the recording order across different machines, which is pivotal for discerning causal relationships within the manufacturing data. However, previous methods for handling missing data in scenarios akin to real-world conditions have not been able to effectively utilize expert knowledge. Conversely, prior methods that can incorporate expert knowledge struggle with datasets that exhibit missing values. Therefore, we propose COKE to construct causal graphs in manufacturing datasets by leveraging expert knowledge and chronological order among sensors without imputing missing data. Utilizing the characteristics of the recipe, we maximize the use of samples with missing values, derive embeddings from intersections with an initial graph that incorporates expert knowledge and chronological order, and create a sensor ordering graph. The graph-generating process has been optimized by an actor-critic architecture to obtain a final graph that has a maximum reward. Experimental evaluations in diverse settings of sensor quantities and missing proportions demonstrate that our approach compared with the benchmark methods shows an average improvement of 39.9% in the F1-score. Moreover, the F1-score improvement can reach 62.6% when considering the configuration similar to real-world datasets, and 85.0% in real-world semiconductor datasets.

Abstract: The most fundamental capability of modern AI methods such as Large Language Models (LLMs) is the ability to predict the next token in a long sequence of tokens, known as ``sequence modeling." Although the Transformers model is the current dominant approach to sequence modeling, its quadratic computational cost with respect to sequence length is a significant drawback. State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.</description>

      <title>Jumping Ahead: Improving Reconstruction Fidelity with JumpReLU Sparse Autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a promising unsupervised approach for identifying causally relevant and interpretable linear features in a language model's (LM) activations. To be useful for downstream tasks, SAEs need to decompose LM activations faithfully; yet to be interpretable the decomposition must be sparse -- two objectives that are in tension. In this paper, we introduce JumpReLU SAEs, which achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity at a given sparsity level on Gemma 2 9B activations, compared to other recent advances such as Gated and TopK SAEs. We also show that this improvement does not come at the cost of interpretability through manual and automated interpretability studies. JumpReLU SAEs are a simple modification of vanilla (ReLU) SAEs -- where we replace the ReLU with a discontinuous JumpReLU activation function -- and are similarly efficient to train and run. By utilising straight-through-estimators (STEs) in a principled manner, we show how it is possible to train JumpReLU SAEs effectively despite the discontinuous JumpReLU function introduced in the SAE's forward pass. Similarly, we use STEs to directly train L0 to be sparse, instead of training on proxies such as L1, avoiding problems like shrinkage.</description>

      <title>OpenUAS: Embeddings of Cities in Japan with Anchor Data for Cross-city Analysis of Area Usage Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We publicly release OpenUAS, a dataset of area embeddings based on urban usage patterns, including embeddings for over 1.3 million 50-meter square meshes covering a total area of 3,300 square kilometers. This dataset is valuable for analyzing area functions in fields such as market analysis, urban planning, transportation infrastructure, and infection prediction. It captures the characteristics of each area in the city, such as office districts and residential areas, by employing an area embedding technique that utilizes location information typically obtained by GPS. Numerous area embedding techniques have been proposed, and while the public release of such embedding datasets is technically feasible, it has not been realized. One of the obstacles has been the integration of data from different cities and periods into a unified space without sharing raw location data. We address this issue by developing an anchoring method that establishes anchors within a shared embedding space. We publicly release this anchor dataset along with area embedding datasets from several periods in eight major Japanese cities. This dataset allows users to analyze urban usage patterns in Japanese cities and embed their urban dataset into the same embedding space using the anchoring method. Our key contributions include the development of the anchoring method, releasing area embedding datasets for Japanese cities, and providing tools for effective data utilization.</description>

      <title>MimiQ: Low-Bit Data-Free Quantization of Vision Transformers with Encouraging Inter-Head Attention Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-free quantization (DFQ) is a technique that creates a lightweight network from its full-precision counterpart without the original training data, often through a synthetic dataset. Although several DFQ methods have been proposed for vision transformer (ViT) architectures, they fail to achieve efficacy in low-bit settings. Examining the existing methods, we identify that their synthetic data produce misaligned attention maps, while those of the real samples are highly aligned. From the observation of aligned attention, we find that aligning attention maps of synthetic data helps to improve the overall performance of quantized ViTs. Motivated by this finding, we devise MimiQ, a novel DFQ method designed for ViTs that focuses on inter-head attention similarity. First, we generate synthetic data by aligning head-wise attention responses in relation to spatial query patches. Then, we apply head-wise structural attention distillation to align the attention maps of the quantized network to those of the full-precision teacher. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art performance for data-free ViT quantization.</description>

      <title>Dataset Distillation for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning often requires a quality dataset that we can train a policy on. However, in many situations, it is not possible to get such a dataset, nor is it easy to train a policy to perform well in the actual environment given the offline data. We propose using data distillation to train and distill a better dataset which can then be used for training a better policy model. We show that our method is able to synthesize a dataset where a model trained on it achieves similar performance to a model trained on the full dataset or a model trained using percentile behavioral cloning. Our project site is available at $\href{https://datasetdistillation4rl.github.io}{\text{here}}$. We also provide our implementation at $\href{https://github.com/ggflow123/DDRL}{\text{this GitHub repository}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of class outliers on the effectiveness of example-based explainability methods for black-box machine learning models. We reformulate existing explainability evaluation metrics, such as correctness and relevance, specifically for example-based methods, and introduce a new metric, distinguishability. Using these metrics, we highlight the shortcomings of current example-based explainability methods, including those who attempt to suppress class outliers. We conduct experiments on two datasets, a text classification dataset and an image classification dataset, and evaluate the performance of four state-of-the-art explainability methods. Our findings underscore the need for robust techniques to tackle the challenges posed by class outliers.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Factor Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Factor analysis, often regarded as a Bayesian variant of matrix factorization, offers superior capabilities in capturing uncertainty, modeling complex dependencies, and ensuring robustness. As the deep learning era arrives, factor analysis is receiving less and less attention due to their limited expressive ability. On the contrary, contrastive learning has emerged as a potent technique with demonstrated efficacy in unsupervised representational learning. While the two methods are different paradigms, recent theoretical analysis has revealed the mathematical equivalence between contrastive learning and matrix factorization, providing a potential possibility for factor analysis combined with contrastive learning. Motivated by the interconnectedness of contrastive learning, matrix factorization, and factor analysis, this paper introduces a novel Contrastive Factor Analysis framework, aiming to leverage factor analysis's advantageous properties within the realm of contrastive learning. To further leverage the interpretability properties of non-negative factor analysis, which can learn disentangled representations, contrastive factor analysis is extended to a non-negative version. Finally, extensive experimental validation showcases the efficacy of the proposed contrastive (non-negative) factor analysis methodology across multiple key properties, including expressiveness, robustness, interpretability, and accurate uncertainty estimation.</description>

      <title>Neyman-Pearson Multi-class Classification via Cost-sensitive Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.04597v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most existing classification methods aim to minimize the overall misclassification error rate. However, in applications such as loan default prediction, different types of errors can have varying consequences. To address this asymmetry issue, two popular paradigms have been developed: the Neyman-Pearson (NP) paradigm and the cost-sensitive (CS) paradigm. Previous studies on the NP paradigm have primarily focused on the binary case, while the multi-class NP problem poses a greater challenge due to its unknown feasibility. In this work, we tackle the multi-class NP problem by establishing a connection with the CS problem via strong duality and propose two algorithms. We extend the concept of NP oracle inequalities, crucial in binary classifications, to NP oracle properties in the multi-class context. Our algorithms satisfy these NP oracle properties under certain conditions. Furthermore, we develop practical algorithms to assess the feasibility and strong duality in multi-class NP problems, which can offer practitioners the landscape of a multi-class NP problem with various target error levels. Simulations and real data studies validate the effectiveness of our algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first study to address the multi-class NP problem with theoretical guarantees. The proposed algorithms have been implemented in the R package \texttt{npcs}, which is available on CRAN.</description>

      <title>Enhancing convolutional neural network generalizability via low-rank weight approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Noise is ubiquitous during image acquisition. Sufficient denoising is often an important first step for image processing. In recent decades, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely used for image denoising. Most DNN-based image denoising methods require a large-scale dataset or focus on supervised settings, in which single/pairs of clean images or a set of noisy images are required. This poses a significant burden on the image acquisition process. Moreover, denoisers trained on datasets of limited scale may incur over-fitting. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a new self-supervised framework for image denoising based on the Tucker low-rank tensor approximation. With the proposed design, we are able to characterize our denoiser with fewer parameters and train it based on a single image, which considerably improves the model's generalizability and reduces the cost of data acquisition. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world noisy images have been conducted. Empirical results show that our proposed method outperforms existing non-learning-based methods (e.g., low-pass filter, non-local mean), single-image unsupervised denoisers (e.g., DIP, NN+BM3D) evaluated on both in-sample and out-sample datasets. The proposed method even achieves comparable performances with some supervised methods (e.g., DnCNN).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.15224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised learning has been widely used in many real-world applications. One of the simplest and most important unsupervised learning models is the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). In this work, we study the multi-task learning problem on GMMs, which aims to leverage potentially similar GMM parameter structures among tasks to obtain improved learning performance compared to single-task learning. We propose a multi-task GMM learning procedure based on the EM algorithm that effectively utilizes unknown similarities between related tasks and is robust against a fraction of outlier tasks from arbitrary distributions. The proposed procedure is shown to achieve the minimax optimal rate of convergence for both parameter estimation error and the excess mis-clustering error, in a wide range of regimes. Moreover, we generalize our approach to tackle the problem of transfer learning for GMMs, where similar theoretical results are derived. Additionally, iterative unsupervised multi-task and transfer learning methods may suffer from an initialization alignment problem, and two alignment algorithms are proposed to resolve the issue. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through simulations and real data examples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying multi-task and transfer learning on GMMs with theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>DPIS: An Enhanced Mechanism for Differentially Private SGD with Importance Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09634v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, differential privacy (DP) has become a well-accepted standard for privacy protection, and deep neural networks (DNN) have been immensely successful in machine learning. The combination of these two techniques, i.e., deep learning with differential privacy, promises the privacy-preserving release of high-utility models trained with sensitive data such as medical records. A classic mechanism for this purpose is DP-SGD, which is a differentially private version of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer commonly used for DNN training. Subsequent approaches have improved various aspects of the model training process, including noise decay schedule, model architecture, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning. However, the core mechanism for enforcing DP in the SGD optimizer remains unchanged ever since the original DP-SGD algorithm, which has increasingly become a fundamental barrier limiting the performance of DP-compliant machine learning solutions.
  Motivated by this, we propose DPIS, a novel mechanism for differentially private SGD training that can be used as a drop-in replacement of the core optimizer of DP-SGD, with consistent and significant accuracy gains over the latter. The main idea is to employ importance sampling (IS) in each SGD iteration for mini-batch selection, which reduces both sampling variance and the amount of random noise injected to the gradients that is required to satisfy DP. Integrating IS into the complex mathematical machinery of DP-SGD is highly non-trivial. DPIS addresses the challenge through novel mechanism designs, fine-grained privacy analysis, efficiency enhancements, and an adaptive gradient clipping optimization. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, namely MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10 and IMDb, demonstrate the superior effectiveness of DPIS over existing solutions for deep learning with differential privacy.</description>

      <title>Application of Transformers for Nonlinear Channel Compensation in Optical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new nonlinear optical channel equalizer based on Transformers. By leveraging parallel computation and attending directly to the memory across a sequence of symbols, we show that Transformers can be used effectively for nonlinear compensation (NLC) in coherent long-haul transmission systems. For this application, we present an implementation of the encoder part of the Transformer and analyze its performance over a wide range of different hyper-parameters. It is shown that by proper embeddings and processing blocks of symbols at each iteration and also carefully selecting subsets of the encoder's output to be processed together, an efficient nonlinear equalization can be achieved for different complexity constraints. To reduce the computational complexity of the attention mechanism, we further propose the use of a physic-informed mask inspired by nonlinear perturbation theory. We also compare the Transformer-NLC with digital back-propagation (DBP) under different transmission scenarios in order to demonstrate the flexibility and generalizability of the proposed data-driven solution.</description>

      <title>Evaluate Fine-tuning Strategies for Fetal Head Ultrasound Image Segmentation with U-Net</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fetal head segmentation is a crucial step in measuring the fetal head circumference (HC) during gestation, an important biometric in obstetrics for monitoring fetal growth. However, manual biometry generation is time-consuming and results in inconsistent accuracy. To address this issue, convolutional neural network (CNN) models have been utilized to improve the efficiency of medical biometry. But training a CNN network from scratch is a challenging task, we proposed a Transfer Learning (TL) method. Our approach involves fine-tuning (FT) a U-Net network with a lightweight MobileNet as the encoder to perform segmentation on a set of fetal head ultrasound (US) images with limited effort. This method addresses the challenges associated with training a CNN network from scratch. It suggests that our proposed FT strategy yields segmentation performance that is comparable when trained with a reduced number of parameters by 85.8%. And our proposed FT strategy outperforms other strategies with smaller trainable parameter sizes below 4.4 million. Thus, we contend that it can serve as a dependable FT approach for reducing the size of models in medical image analysis. Our key findings highlight the importance of the balance between model performance and size in developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications by TL methods.

Abstract: We present a model-agnostic framework for the construction of prediction intervals of insurance claims, with finite sample statistical guarantees, extending the technique of split conformal prediction to the domain of two-stage frequency-severity modeling. The framework effectiveness is showcased with simulated and real datasets using classical parametric models and contemporary machine learning methods. When the underlying severity model is a random forest, we extend the two-stage split conformal prediction algorithm, showing how the out-of-bag mechanism can be leveraged to eliminate the need for a calibration set in the conformal procedure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the promising results of machine learning models in malicious files detection, they face the problem of concept drift due to their constant evolution. This leads to declining performance over time, as the data distribution of the new files differs from the training one, requiring frequent model update. In this work, we propose a model-agnostic protocol to improve a baseline neural network against drift. We show the importance of feature reduction and training with the most recent validation set possible, and propose a loss function named Drift-Resilient Binary Cross-Entropy, an improvement to the classical Binary Cross-Entropy more effective against drift. We train our model on the EMBER dataset, published in2018, and evaluate it on a dataset of recent malicious files, collected between 2020 and 2023. Our improved model shows promising results, detecting 15.2% more malware than a baseline model.</description>

We demonstrate the opportunities offered by our approach on sets of organic, inorganic and crystalline compounds. In particular, we developed and tested the model using the Matbench and Moleculenet benchmarks, which include crystal properties and drug design-related benchmarks. We also conduct an analysis of vector representations of chemical compounds, shedding light on the underlying patterns in structural data. Our model exhibits exceptional predictive capabilities and proves universally applicable to molecular and material datasets. For instance, on the Tox21 dataset, we achieved an average precision of 96%, surpassing the previously best result by 10%.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Local Explainability and Trust Scores with Random Forest Proximities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate a novel approach to explain the predictions and out of sample performance of random forest (RF) regression and classification models by exploiting the fact that any RF can be mathematically formulated as an adaptive weighted K nearest-neighbors model. Specifically, we employ a recent result that, for both regression and classification tasks, any RF prediction can be rewritten exactly as a weighted sum of the training targets, where the weights are RF proximities between the corresponding pairs of data points. We show that this linearity facilitates a local notion of explainability of RF predictions that generates attributions for any model prediction across observations in the training set, and thereby complements established feature-based methods like SHAP, which generate attributions for a model prediction across input features. We show how this proximity-based approach to explainability can be used in conjunction with SHAP to explain not just the model predictions, but also out-of-sample performance, in the sense that proximities furnish a novel means of assessing when a given model prediction is more or less likely to be correct. We demonstrate this approach in the modeling of US corporate bond prices and returns in both regression and classification cases.</description>

      <title>SC-MIL: Sparsely Coded Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been widely used in weakly supervised whole slide image (WSI) classification. Typical MIL methods include a feature embedding part, which embeds the instances into features via a pre-trained feature extractor, and an MIL aggregator that combines instance embeddings into predictions. Most efforts have typically focused on improving these parts. This involves refining the feature embeddings through self-supervised pre-training as well as modeling the correlations between instances separately.
  In this paper, we proposed a sparsely coding MIL (SC-MIL) method that addresses those two aspects at the same time by leveraging sparse dictionary learning. The sparse dictionary learning captures the similarities of instances by expressing them as sparse linear combinations of atoms in an over-complete dictionary. In addition, imposing sparsity improves instance feature embeddings by suppressing irrelevant instances while retaining the most relevant ones. To make the conventional sparse coding algorithm compatible with deep learning, we unrolled it into a sparsely coded module leveraging deep unrolling. The proposed SC module can be incorporated into any existing MIL framework in a plug-and-play manner with an acceptable computational cost. The experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrated that the proposed SC module could substantially boost the performance of state-of-the-art MIL methods.

      <title>An introduction to reinforcement learning for neuroscience</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has a rich history in neuroscience, from early work on dopamine as a reward prediction error signal for temporal difference learning (Schultz et al., 1997) to recent work suggesting that dopamine could implement a form of 'distributional reinforcement learning' popularized in deep learning (Dabney et al., 2020). Throughout this literature, there has been a tight link between theoretical advances in reinforcement learning and neuroscientific experiments and findings. As a result, the theories describing our experimental data have become increasingly complex and difficult to navigate. In this review, we cover the basic theory underlying classical work in reinforcement learning and build up to an introductory overview of methods in modern deep reinforcement learning that have found applications in systems neuroscience. We start with an overview of the reinforcement learning problem and classical temporal difference algorithms, followed by a discussion of 'model-free' and 'model-based' reinforcement learning together with methods such as DYNA and successor representations that fall in between these two extremes. Throughout these sections, we highlight the close parallels between such machine learning methods and related work in both experimental and theoretical neuroscience. We then provide an introduction to deep reinforcement learning with examples of how these methods have been used to model different learning phenomena in systems neuroscience, such as meta-reinforcement learning (Wang et al., 2018) and distributional reinforcement learning (Dabney et al., 2020). Code that implements the methods discussed in this work and generates the figures is also provided.</description>

      <title>A causal intervention framework for synthesizing mobility data and evaluating predictive neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11749v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly utilized in mobility prediction tasks, yet their intricate internal workings pose challenges for interpretability, especially in comprehending how various aspects of mobility behavior affect predictions. This study introduces a causal intervention framework to assess the impact of mobility-related factors on neural networks designed for next location prediction -- a task focusing on predicting the immediate next location of an individual. To achieve this, we employ individual mobility models to synthesize location visit sequences and control behavior dynamics by intervening in their data generation process. We evaluate the interventional location sequences using mobility metrics and input them into well-trained networks to analyze performance variations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness in producing location sequences with distinct mobility behaviors, thereby facilitating the simulation of diverse yet realistic spatial and temporal changes. These changes result in performance fluctuations in next location prediction networks, revealing impacts of critical mobility behavior factors, including sequential patterns in location transitions, proclivity for exploring new locations, and preferences in location choices at population and individual levels. The gained insights hold value for the real-world application of mobility prediction networks, and the framework is expected to promote the use of causal inference to enhance the interpretability and robustness of neural networks in mobility applications.</description>

      <title>TriDeNT: Triple Deep Network Training for Privileged Knowledge Distillation in Histopathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02111v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational pathology models rarely utilise data that will not be available for inference. This means most models cannot learn from highly informative data such as additional immunohistochemical (IHC) stains and spatial transcriptomics. We present TriDeNT, a novel self-supervised method for utilising privileged data that is not available during inference to improve performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method for a range of different paired data including immunohistochemistry, spatial transcriptomics and expert nuclei annotations. In all settings, TriDeNT outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks, with observed improvements of up to 101%. Furthermore, we provide qualitative and quantitative measurements of the features learned by these models and how they differ from baselines. TriDeNT offers a novel method to distil knowledge from scarce or costly data during training, to create significantly better models for routine inputs.</description>

      <title>KGLens: Towards Efficient and Effective Knowledge Probing of Large Language Models with Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) might hallucinate facts, while curated Knowledge Graph (KGs) are typically factually reliable especially with domain-specific knowledge. Measuring the alignment between KGs and LLMs can effectively probe the factualness and identify the knowledge blind spots of LLMs. However, verifying the LLMs over extensive KGs can be expensive. In this paper, we present KGLens, a Thompson-sampling-inspired framework aimed at effectively and efficiently measuring the alignment between KGs and LLMs. KGLens features a graph-guided question generator for converting KGs into natural language, along with a carefully designed importance sampling strategy based on parameterized KG structure to expedite KG traversal. Our simulation experiment compares the brute force method with KGLens under six different sampling methods, demonstrating that our approach achieves superior probing efficiency. Leveraging KGLens, we conducted in-depth analyses of the factual accuracy of ten LLMs across three large domain-specific KGs from Wikidata, composing over 19K edges, 700 relations, and 21K entities. Human evaluation results indicate that KGLens can assess LLMs with a level of accuracy nearly equivalent to that of human annotators, achieving 95.7% of the accuracy rate.</description>

      <title>Modeling Latent Selection with Structural Causal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Selection bias is ubiquitous in real-world data, and can lead to misleading results if not dealt with properly. We introduce a conditioning operation on Structural Causal Models (SCMs) to model latent selection from a causal perspective. We show that the conditioning operation transforms an SCM with the presence of an explicit latent selection mechanism into an SCM without such selection mechanism, which partially encodes the causal semantics of the selected subpopulation according to the original SCM. Furthermore, we show that this conditioning operation preserves the simplicity, acyclicity, and linearity of SCMs, and commutes with marginalization. Thanks to these properties, combined with marginalization and intervention, the conditioning operation offers a valuable tool for conducting causal reasoning tasks within causal models where latent details have been abstracted away. We demonstrate by example how classical results of causal inference can be generalized to include selection bias and how the conditioning operation helps with modeling of real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Learning Backdoors for Mixed Integer Linear Programs with Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world problems can be efficiently modeled as Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) and solved with the Branch-and-Bound method. Prior work has shown the existence of MILP backdoors, small sets of variables such that prioritizing branching on them when possible leads to faster running times. However, finding high-quality backdoors that improve running times remains an open question. Previous work learns to estimate the relative solver speed of randomly sampled backdoors through ranking and then decide whether to use the highest-ranked backdoor candidate. In this paper, we utilize the Monte-Carlo tree search method to collect backdoors for training, rather than relying on random sampling, and adapt a contrastive learning framework to train a Graph Attention Network model to predict backdoors. Our method, evaluated on several common MILP problem domains, demonstrates performance improvements over both Gurobi and previous models.</description>

      <title>DefInt: A Default-interventionist Framework for Efficient Reasoning with Hybrid Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive emergent abilities in a wide range of tasks, but still face challenges in handling complex reasoning problems. Previous works like chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thoughts (ToT) have predominately focused on enhancing accuracy, but overlook the rapidly increasing token cost, which could be particularly problematic for open-ended real-world tasks with huge solution spaces. Motivated by the dual process theory of human cognition, we propose a Default-Interventionist framework (DefInt) to unleash the synergistic potential of hybrid LLMs. By default, DefInt uses smaller-scale language models to generate low-cost reasoning thoughts, which resembles the fast intuitions produced by System 1. If the intuitions are considered with low confidence, DefInt will invoke the reflective reasoning of scaled-up language models as the intervention of System 2, which can override the default thoughts and rectify the reasoning process. Experiments on five representative reasoning tasks show that DefInt consistently achieves state-of-the-art reasoning accuracy and solution diversity. More importantly, it substantially reduces the token cost by 49%-79% compared to the second accurate baselines. Specifically, the open-ended tasks have an average 75% token cost reduction. Code repo with all prompts will be released upon publication.</description>

      <title>Grasp, See and Place: Efficient Unknown Object Rearrangement with Policy Structure Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focus on the task of unknown object rearrangement, where a robot is supposed to re-configure the objects into a desired goal configuration specified by an RGB-D image. Recent works explore unknown object rearrangement systems by incorporating learning-based perception modules. However, they are sensitive to perception error, and pay less attention to task-level performance. In this paper, we aim to develop an effective system for unknown object rearrangement amidst perception noise. We theoretically reveal the noisy perception impacts grasp and place in a decoupled way, and show such a decoupled structure is valuable to improve task optimality. We propose GSP, a dual-loop system with the decoupled structure as prior. For the inner loop, we learn a see policy for self-confident in-hand object matching. For the outer loop, we learn a grasp policy aware of object matching and grasp capability guided by task-level rewards. We leverage the foundation model CLIP for object matching, policy learning and self-termination. A series of experiments indicate that GSP can conduct unknown object rearrangement with higher completion rates and fewer steps.</description>

      <title>Attention-based Class-Conditioned Alignment for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation of Object Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain adaptation methods for object detection (OD) strive to mitigate the impact of distribution shifts by promoting feature alignment across source and target domains. Multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) allows leveraging multiple annotated source datasets and unlabeled target data to improve the accuracy and robustness of the detection model. Most state-of-the-art MSDA methods for OD perform feature alignment in a class-agnostic manner. This is challenging since the objects have unique modal information due to variations in object appearance across domains. A recent prototype-based approach proposed a class-wise alignment, yet it suffers from error accumulation due to noisy pseudo-labels that can negatively affect adaptation with imbalanced data. To overcome these limitations, we propose an attention-based class-conditioned alignment method for MSDA that aligns instances of each object category across domains. In particular, an attention module coupled with an adversarial domain classifier allows learning domain-invariant and class-specific instance representations. Experimental results on multiple benchmarking MSDA datasets indicate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and is robust to class imbalance using a conceptually simple class-conditioning method. Our code is available at https://github.com/imatif17/ACIA.</description>

      <title>AlignRec: Aligning and Training in Multimodal Recommendations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12384v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the development of multimedia systems, multimodal recommendations are playing an essential role, as they can leverage rich contexts beyond interactions. Existing methods mainly regard multimodal information as an auxiliary, using them to help learn ID features; However, there exist semantic gaps among multimodal content features and ID-based features, for which directly using multimodal information as an auxiliary would lead to misalignment in representations of users and items. In this paper, we first systematically investigate the misalignment issue in multimodal recommendations, and propose a solution named AlignRec. In AlignRec, the recommendation objective is decomposed into three alignments, namely alignment within contents, alignment between content and categorical ID, and alignment between users and items. Each alignment is characterized by a specific objective function and is integrated into our multimodal recommendation framework. To effectively train AlignRec, we propose starting from pre-training the first alignment to obtain unified multimodal features and subsequently training the following two alignments together with these features as input. As it is essential to analyze whether each multimodal feature helps in training and accelerate the iteration cycle of recommendation models, we design three new classes of metrics to evaluate intermediate performance. Our extensive experiments on three real-world datasets consistently verify the superiority of AlignRec compared to nine baselines. We also find that the multimodal features generated by AlignRec are better than currently used ones, which are to be open-sourced in our repository https://github.com/sjtulyf123/AlignRec_CIKM24.</description>

      <title>The opportunities and risks of large language models in mental health</title>

Abstract: Global rates of mental health concerns are rising, and there is increasing realization that existing models of mental health care will not adequately expand to meet the demand. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has come great optimism regarding their promise to create novel, large-scale solutions to support mental health. Despite their nascence, LLMs have already been applied to mental health related tasks. In this paper, we summarize the extant literature on efforts to use LLMs to provide mental health education, assessment, and intervention and highlight key opportunities for positive impact in each area. We then highlight risks associated with LLMs' application to mental health and encourage the adoption of strategies to mitigate these risks. The urgent need for mental health support must be balanced with responsible development, testing, and deployment of mental health LLMs. It is especially critical to ensure that mental health LLMs are fine-tuned for mental health, enhance mental health equity, and adhere to ethical standards and that people, including those with lived experience with mental health concerns, are involved in all stages from development through deployment. Prioritizing these efforts will minimize potential harms to mental health and maximize the likelihood that LLMs will positively impact mental health globally.</description>

      <title>Grappa -- A Machine Learned Molecular Mechanics Force Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating large molecular systems over long timescales requires force fields that are both accurate and efficient. In recent years, E(3) equivariant neural networks have lifted the tension between computational efficiency and accuracy of force fields, but they are still several orders of magnitude more expensive than established molecular mechanics (MM) force fields. Here, we propose Grappa, a machine learning framework to predict MM parameters from the molecular graph, employing a graph attentional neural network and a transformer with symmetry-preserving positional encoding. The resulting Grappa force field outperformstabulated and machine-learned MM force fields in terms of accuracy at the same computational efficiency and can be used in existing Molecular Dynamics (MD) engines like GROMACS and OpenMM. It predicts energies and forces of small molecules, peptides, RNA and - showcasing its extensibility to uncharted regions of chemical space - radicals at state-of-the-art MM accuracy. We demonstrate Grappa's transferability to macromolecules in MD simulations from a small fast folding protein up to a whole virus particle. Our force field sets the stage for biomolecular simulations closer to chemical accuracy, but with the same computational cost as established protein force fields.</description>

      <title>Improving Retrieval for RAG based Question Answering Models on Financial Documents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating accurate responses relies heavily on the quality of input provided, particularly when employing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. RAG enhances LLMs by sourcing the most relevant text chunk(s) to base queries upon. Despite the significant advancements in LLMs' response quality in recent years, users may still encounter inaccuracies or irrelevant answers; these issues often stem from suboptimal text chunk retrieval by RAG rather than the inherent capabilities of LLMs. To augment the efficacy of LLMs, it is crucial to refine the RAG process. This paper explores the existing constraints of RAG pipelines and introduces methodologies for enhancing text retrieval. It delves into strategies such as sophisticated chunking techniques, query expansion, the incorporation of metadata annotations, the application of re-ranking algorithms, and the fine-tuning of embedding algorithms. Implementing these approaches can substantially improve the retrieval quality, thereby elevating the overall performance and reliability of LLMs in processing and responding to queries.</description>

      <title>Debiased Distribution Compression</title>

Abstract: Modern compression methods can summarize a target distribution $\mathbb{P}$ more succinctly than i.i.d. sampling but require access to a low-bias input sequence like a Markov chain converging quickly to $\mathbb{P}$. We introduce a new suite of compression methods suitable for compression with biased input sequences. Given $n$ points targeting the wrong distribution and quadratic time, Stein kernel thinning (SKT) returns $\sqrt{n}$ equal-weighted points with $\widetilde{O}(n^{-1/2})$ maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to $\mathbb{P}$. For larger-scale compression tasks, low-rank SKT achieves the same feat in sub-quadratic time using an adaptive low-rank debiasing procedure that may be of independent interest. For downstream tasks that support simplex or constant-preserving weights, Stein recombination and Stein Cholesky achieve even greater parsimony, matching the guarantees of SKT with as few as $\text{poly-log}(n)$ weighted points. Underlying these advances are new guarantees for the quality of simplex-weighted coresets, the spectral decay of kernel matrices, and the covering numbers of Stein kernel Hilbert spaces. In our experiments, our techniques provide succinct and accurate posterior summaries while overcoming biases due to burn-in, approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo, and tempering.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Next Point-of-Interest Recommendation</title>

Abstract: The next Point of Interest (POI) recommendation task is to predict users' immediate next POI visit given their historical data. Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) data, which is often used for the next POI recommendation task, comes with challenges. One frequently disregarded challenge is how to effectively use the abundant contextual information present in LBSN data. Previous methods are limited by their numerical nature and fail to address this challenge. In this paper, we propose a framework that uses pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle this challenge. Our framework allows us to preserve heterogeneous LBSN data in its original format, hence avoiding the loss of contextual information. Furthermore, our framework is capable of comprehending the inherent meaning of contextual information due to the inclusion of commonsense knowledge. In experiments, we test our framework on three real-world LBSN datasets. Our results show that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models in all three datasets. Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in using contextual information as well as alleviating the commonly encountered cold-start and short trajectory problems.</description>

      <title>A Correlation-induced Finite Difference Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite difference (FD) approximation is a classic approach to stochastic gradient estimation when only noisy function realizations are available. In this paper, we first provide a sample-driven method via the bootstrap technique to estimate the optimal perturbation, and then propose an efficient FD estimator based on correlated samples at the estimated optimal perturbation. Furthermore, theoretical analyses of both the perturbation estimator and the FD estimator reveal that, {\it surprisingly}, the correlation enables the proposed FD estimator to achieve a reduction in variance and, in some cases, a decrease in bias compared to the traditional optimal FD estimator. Numerical results confirm the efficiency of our estimators and align well with the theory presented, especially in scenarios with small sample sizes. Finally, we apply the estimator to solve derivative-free optimization (DFO) problems, and numerical studies show that DFO problems with 100 dimensions can be effectively solved.</description>

      <title>GRU-Net: Gaussian Attention Aided Dense Skip Connection Based MultiResUNet for Breast Histopathology Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Breast cancer is a major global health concern. Pathologists face challenges in analyzing complex features from pathological images, which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. Therefore, efficient computer-based diagnostic tools are needed for early detection and treatment planning. This paper presents a modified version of MultiResU-Net for histopathology image segmentation, which is selected as the backbone for its ability to analyze and segment complex features at multiple scales and ensure effective feature flow via skip connections. The modified version also utilizes the Gaussian distribution-based Attention Module (GdAM) to incorporate histopathology-relevant text information in a Gaussian distribution. The sampled features from the Gaussian text feature-guided distribution highlight specific spatial regions based on prior knowledge. Finally, using the Controlled Dense Residual Block (CDRB) on skip connections of MultiResU-Net, the information is transferred from the encoder layers to the decoder layers in a controlled manner using a scaling parameter derived from the extracted spatial features. We validate our approach on two diverse breast cancer histopathology image datasets: TNBC and MonuSeg, demonstrating superior segmentation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code for our proposed model is available on https://github.com/AyushRoy2001/GRU-Net.</description>

      <title>A Notion of Complexity for Theory of Mind via Discrete World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) can be used to assess the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex scenarios where social reasoning is required. While the research community has proposed many ToM benchmarks, their hardness varies greatly, and their complexity is not well defined. This work proposes a framework to measure the complexity of ToM tasks. We quantify a problem's complexity as the number of states necessary to solve it correctly. Our complexity measure also accounts for spurious states of a ToM problem designed to make it apparently harder. We use our method to assess the complexity of five widely adopted ToM benchmarks. On top of this framework, we design a prompting technique that augments the information available to a model with a description of how the environment changes with the agents' interactions. We name this technique Discrete World Models (DWM) and show how it elicits superior performance on ToM tasks.</description>

      <title>A Likelihood-Based Generative Approach for Spatially Consistent Precipitation Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for precipitation downscaling. However, current models rely on likelihood-based loss functions to properly model the precipitation distribution, leading to spatially inconsistent projections when sampling. This work explores a novel approach by fusing the strengths of likelihood-based and adversarial losses used in generative models. As a result, we propose a likelihood-based generative approach for precipitation downscaling, leveraging the benefits of both methods.</description>

      <title>YourMT3+: Multi-instrument Music Transcription with Enhanced Transformer Architectures and Cross-dataset Stem Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04822v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-instrument music transcription aims to convert polyphonic music recordings into musical scores assigned to each instrument. This task is challenging for modeling as it requires simultaneously identifying multiple instruments and transcribing their pitch and precise timing, and the lack of fully annotated data adds to the training difficulties. This paper introduces YourMT3+, a suite of models for enhanced multi-instrument music transcription based on the recent language token decoding approach of MT3. We enhance its encoder by adopting a hierarchical attention transformer in the time-frequency domain and integrating a mixture of experts. To address data limitations, we introduce a new multi-channel decoding method for training with incomplete annotations and propose intra- and cross-stem augmentation for dataset mixing. Our experiments demonstrate direct vocal transcription capabilities, eliminating the need for voice separation pre-processors. Benchmarks across ten public datasets show our models' competitiveness with, or superiority to, existing transcription models. Further testing on pop music recordings highlights the limitations of current models. Fully reproducible code and datasets are available with demos at \url{https://github.com/mimbres/YourMT3}.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamiltonian Embedding of Images for Data Reuploading Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When applying quantum computing to machine learning tasks, one of the first considerations is the design of the quantum machine learning model itself. Conventionally, the design of quantum machine learning algorithms relies on the ``quantisation" of classical learning algorithms, such as using quantum linear algebra to implement important subroutines of classical algorithms, if not the entire algorithm, seeking to achieve quantum advantage through possible run-time accelerations brought by quantum computing. However, recent research has started questioning whether quantum advantage via speedup is the right goal for quantum machine learning [1]. Research also has been undertaken to exploit properties that are unique to quantum systems, such as quantum contextuality, to better design quantum machine learning models [2]. In this paper, we take an alternative approach by incorporating the heuristics and empirical evidences from the design of classical deep learning algorithms to the design of quantum neural networks. We first construct a model based on the data reuploading circuit [3] with the quantum Hamiltonian data embedding unitary [4]. Through numerical experiments on images datasets, including the famous MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms the quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN)[5] by a large margin (up to over 40% on MNIST test set). Based on the model design process and numerical results, we then laid out six principles for designing quantum machine learning models, especially quantum neural networks.</description>

      <title>Beyond Size and Class Balance: Alpha as a New Dataset Quality Metric for Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In deep learning, achieving high performance on image classification tasks requires diverse training sets. However, the current best practice$\unicode{x2013}$maximizing dataset size and class balance$\unicode{x2013}$does not guarantee dataset diversity. We hypothesized that, for a given model architecture, model performance can be improved by maximizing diversity more directly. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a comprehensive framework of diversity measures from ecology that generalizes familiar quantities like Shannon entropy by accounting for similarities among images. (Size and class balance emerge as special cases.) Analyzing thousands of subsets from seven medical datasets showed that the best correlates of performance were not size or class balance but $A$$\unicode{x2013}$"big alpha"$\unicode{x2013}$a set of generalized entropy measures interpreted as the effective number of image-class pairs in the dataset, after accounting for image similarities. One of these, $A_0$, explained 67% of the variance in balanced accuracy, vs. 54% for class balance and just 39% for size. The best pair of measures was size-plus-$A_1$ (79%), which outperformed size-plus-class-balance (74%). Subsets with the largest $A_0$ performed up to 16% better than those with the largest size (median improvement, 8%). We propose maximizing $A$ as a way to improve deep learning performance in medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Sparks of Quantum Advantage and Rapid Retraining in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of quantum computing holds the potential to revolutionize various fields by solving complex problems more efficiently than classical computers. Despite this promise, practical quantum advantage is hindered by current hardware limitations, notably the small number of qubits and high noise levels. In this study, we leverage adiabatic quantum computers to optimize Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, a powerful neural network architecture for representing complex functions with minimal parameters. By modifying the network to use Bezier curves as the basis functions and formulating the optimization problem into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem, we create a fixed-sized solution space, independent of the number of training samples. Our approach demonstrates sparks of quantum advantage through faster training times compared to classical optimizers such as the Adam, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adaptive Gradient, and simulated annealing. Additionally, we introduce a novel rapid retraining capability, enabling the network to be retrained with new data without reprocessing old samples, thus enhancing learning efficiency in dynamic environments. Experimental results on initial training of classification and regression tasks validate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing significant speedups and comparable performance to classical methods. While experiments on retraining demonstrate a sixty times speed up using adiabatic quantum computing based optimization compared to that of the gradient descent based optimizers, with theoretical models allowing this speed up to be even larger! Our findings suggest that with further advancements in quantum hardware and algorithm optimization, quantum-optimized machine learning models could have broad applications across various domains, with initial focus on rapid retraining.</description>

      <title>A Nested Model for AI Design and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing AI field faces trust, transparency, fairness, and discrimination challenges. Despite the need for new regulations, there is a mismatch between regulatory science and AI, preventing a consistent framework. A five-layer nested model for AI design and validation aims to address these issues and streamline AI application design and validation, improving fairness, trust, and AI adoption. This model aligns with regulations, addresses AI practitioner's daily challenges, and offers prescriptive guidance for determining appropriate evaluation approaches by identifying unique validity threats. We have three recommendations motivated by this model: authors should distinguish between layers when claiming contributions to clarify the specific areas in which the contribution is made and to avoid confusion, authors should explicitly state upstream assumptions to ensure that the context and limitations of their AI system are clearly understood, AI venues should promote thorough testing and validation of AI systems and their compliance with regulatory requirements.</description>

      <title>DDU-Net: A Domain Decomposition-based CNN for High-Resolution Image Segmentation on Multiple GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The segmentation of ultra-high resolution images poses challenges such as loss of spatial information or computational inefficiency. In this work, a novel approach that combines encoder-decoder architectures with domain decomposition strategies to address these challenges is proposed. Specifically, a domain decomposition-based U-Net (DDU-Net) architecture is introduced, which partitions input images into non-overlapping patches that can be processed independently on separate devices. A communication network is added to facilitate inter-patch information exchange to enhance the understanding of spatial context. Experimental validation is performed on a synthetic dataset that is designed to measure the effectiveness of the communication network. Then, the performance is tested on the DeepGlobe land cover classification dataset as a real-world benchmark data set. The results demonstrate that the approach, which includes inter-patch communication for images divided into $16\times16$ non-overlapping subimages, achieves a $2-3\,\%$ higher intersection over union (IoU) score compared to the same network without inter-patch communication. The performance of the network which includes communication is equivalent to that of a baseline U-Net trained on the full image, showing that our model provides an effective solution for segmenting ultra-high-resolution images while preserving spatial context. The code is available at https://github.com/corne00/HiRes-Seg-CNN.</description>
