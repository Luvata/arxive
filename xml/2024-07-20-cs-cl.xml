      <title>GPT Czech Poet: Generation of Czech Poetic Strophes with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality automated poetry generation systems are currently only available for a small subset of languages. We introduce a new model for generating poetry in Czech language, based on fine-tuning a pre-trained Large Language Model. We demonstrate that guiding the generation process by explicitly specifying strophe parameters within the poem text strongly improves the effectiveness of the model. We also find that appropriate tokenization is crucial, showing that tokenization methods based on syllables or individual characters instead of subwords prove superior in generating poetic strophes. We further enhance the results by introducing \textit{Forced~generation}, adding explicit specifications of meter and verse parameters at inference time based on the already generated text. We evaluate a range of setups, showing that our proposed approach achieves high accuracies in rhyming and metric aspects of formal quality of the generated poems.</description>

      <title>TourLLM: Enhancing LLMs with Tourism Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the lack of tourism knowledge limits the performance of LLMs in tourist attraction presentations and travel planning. To address this challenge, we constructed a supervised fine-tuning dataset for the culture and tourism domain, named Cultour. This dataset consists of three parts: tourism knowledge base QA data, travelogues data, and tourism diversity QA data. Additionally, we propose TourLLM, a Qwen-based model supervised fine-tuned with Cultour, to improve the quality of the information provided about attractions and travel planning. To evaluate the performance of TourLLM, we employed both automatic and human evaluation, and we proposed a human evaluation criterion named CRA (Consistency, Readability, Availability). The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the responses generated by the TourLLM. Our proposed Cultour is accessible at https://github.com/mrweiqk/Cultour.</description>

      <title>Building Understandable Messaging for Policy and Evidence Review (BUMPER) with AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for the use of large language models (LLMs) in Building Understandable Messaging for Policy and Evidence Review (BUMPER). LLMs are proving capable of providing interfaces for understanding and synthesizing large databases of diverse media. This presents an exciting opportunity to supercharge the translation of scientific evidence into policy and action, thereby improving livelihoods around the world. However, these models also pose challenges related to access, trust-worthiness, and accountability. The BUMPER framework is built atop a scientific knowledge base (e.g., documentation, code, survey data) by the same scientists (e.g., individual contributor, lab, consortium). We focus on a solution that builds trustworthiness through transparency, scope-limiting, explicit-checks, and uncertainty measures. LLMs are rapidly being adopted and consequences are poorly understood. The framework addresses open questions regarding the reliability of LLMs and their use in high-stakes applications. We provide a worked example in health policy for a model designed to inform measles control programs. We argue that this framework can facilitate accessibility of and confidence in scientific evidence for policymakers, drive a focus on policy-relevance and translatability for researchers, and ultimately increase and accelerate the impact of scientific knowledge used for policy decisions.</description>

      <title>Data Generation using Large Language Models for Text Classification: An Empirical Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data for model training has become increasingly popular in recent years. While LLMs are capable of producing realistic training data, the effectiveness of data generation is influenced by various factors, including the choice of prompt, task complexity, and the quality, quantity, and diversity of the generated data. In this work, we focus exclusively on using synthetic data for text classification tasks. Specifically, we use natural language understanding (NLU) models trained on synthetic data to assess the quality of synthetic data from different generation approaches. This work provides an empirical analysis of the impact of these factors and offers recommendations for better data generation practices.</description>

      <title>Computational Politeness in Natural Language Processing: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational approach to politeness is the task of automatically predicting and generating politeness in text. This is a pivotal task for conversational analysis, given the ubiquity and challenges of politeness in interactions. The computational approach to politeness has witnessed great interest from the conversational analysis community. This article is a compilation of past works in computational politeness in natural language processing. We view four milestones in the research so far, viz. supervised and weakly-supervised feature extraction to identify and induce politeness in a given text, incorporation of context beyond the target text, study of politeness across different social factors, and study the relationship between politeness and various sociolinguistic cues. In this article, we describe the datasets, approaches, trends, and issues in computational politeness research. We also discuss representative performance values and provide pointers to future works, as given in the prior works. In terms of resources to understand the state-of-the-art, this survey presents several valuable illustrations, most prominently, a table summarizing the past papers along different dimensions, such as the types of features, annotation techniques, and datasets used.</description>

      <title>SMLT-MUGC: Small, Medium, and Large Texts -- Machine versus User-Generated Content Detection and Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention due to their ability to mimic human language. Identifying texts generated by LLMs is crucial for understanding their capabilities and mitigating potential consequences. This paper analyzes datasets of varying text lengths: small, medium, and large. We compare the performance of machine learning algorithms on four datasets: (1) small (tweets from Election, FIFA, and Game of Thrones), (2) medium (Wikipedia introductions and PubMed abstracts), and (3) large (OpenAI web text dataset). Our results indicate that LLMs with very large parameters (such as the XL-1542 variant of GPT2 with 1542 million parameters) were harder (74%) to detect using traditional machine learning methods. However, detecting texts of varying lengths from LLMs with smaller parameters (762 million or less) can be done with high accuracy (96% and above). We examine the characteristics of human and machine-generated texts across multiple dimensions, including linguistics, personality, sentiment, bias, and morality. Our findings indicate that machine-generated texts generally have higher readability and closely mimic human moral judgments but differ in personality traits. SVM and Voting Classifier (VC) models consistently achieve high performance across most datasets, while Decision Tree (DT) models show the lowest performance. Model performance drops when dealing with rephrased texts, particularly shorter texts like tweets. This study underscores the challenges and importance of detecting LLM-generated texts and suggests directions for future research to improve detection methods and understand the nuanced capabilities of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Error Correction by Paying Attention to Both Acoustic and Confidence References for Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately finding the wrong words in the automatic speech recognition (ASR) hypothesis and recovering them well-founded is the goal of speech error correction. In this paper, we propose a non-autoregressive speech error correction method. A Confidence Module measures the uncertainty of each word of the N-best ASR hypotheses as the reference to find the wrong word position. Besides, the acoustic feature from the ASR encoder is also used to provide the correct pronunciation references. N-best candidates from ASR are aligned using the edit path, to confirm each other and recover some missing character errors. Furthermore, the cross-attention mechanism fuses the information between error correction references and the ASR hypothesis. The experimental results show that both the acoustic and confidence references help with error correction. The proposed system reduces the error rate by 21% compared with the ASR model.</description>

      <title>"I understand why I got this grade": Automatic Short Answer Grading with Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for efficient and accurate assessment methods has intensified as education systems transition to digital platforms. Providing feedback is essential in educational settings and goes beyond simply conveying marks as it justifies the assigned marks. In this context, we present a significant advancement in automated grading by introducing Engineering Short Answer Feedback (EngSAF) -- a dataset of 5.8k student answers accompanied by reference answers and questions for the Automatic Short Answer Grading (ASAG) task. The EngSAF dataset is meticulously curated to cover a diverse range of subjects, questions, and answer patterns from multiple engineering domains. We leverage state-of-the-art large language models' (LLMs) generative capabilities with our Label-Aware Synthetic Feedback Generation (LASFG) strategy to include feedback in our dataset. This paper underscores the importance of enhanced feedback in practical educational settings, outlines dataset annotation and feedback generation processes, conducts a thorough EngSAF analysis, and provides different LLMs-based zero-shot and finetuned baselines for future comparison. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the ASAG system through its deployment in a real-world end-semester exam at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB), showcasing its practical viability and potential for broader implementation in educational institutions.</description>

      <title>PQCache: Product Quantization-based KVCache for Long Context LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to evolve, the context length in inference is steadily growing. Key-Value Cache (KVCache), a crucial component in LLM inference, has now become the primary memory bottleneck due to limited GPU memory. Current methods selectively determine suitable keys and values for self-attention computation in LLMs to address the issue. However, they either fall short in maintaining model quality or result in high serving latency. Drawing inspiration from advanced embedding retrieval techniques used in the database community, we consider the storage and searching of KVCache as a typical embedding retrieval problem. We propose PQCache, which employs Product Quantization (PQ) to manage KVCache, maintaining model quality while ensuring low serving latency. During the prefilling phase, we apply PQ to tokens' keys for each LLM layer and head. During the autoregressive decoding phase, for each newly generated token, we first identify important tokens through Maximum Inner-Product Search (MIPS) using PQ codes and centroids, then fetch the corresponding key-value pairs for self-attention computation. Through meticulous design of overlapping and caching, we minimize any additional computation and communication overhead during both phases. Extensive experiments show that PQCache achieves both effectiveness and efficiency. It maintains model quality even when only 1/5 of the tokens are involved in attention, while attaining acceptable system latency.</description>

      <title>AutoFlow: Automated Workflow Generation for Large Language Model Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in understanding complex natural language. One important application of LLM is LLM-based AI Agent, which leverages the ability of LLM as well as external tools for complex-task solving. To make sure LLM Agents follow an effective and reliable procedure to solve the given task, manually designed workflows are usually used to guide the working mechanism of agents. However, manually designing the workflows requires considerable efforts and domain knowledge, making it difficult to develop and deploy agents on massive scales. To address these issues, we propose AutoFlow, a framework designed to automatically generate workflows for agents to solve complex tasks. AutoFlow takes natural language program as the format of agent workflow and employs a workflow optimization procedure to iteratively optimize the workflow quality. Besides, this work offers two workflow generation methods: fine-tuning-based and in-context-based methods, making the AutoFlow framework applicable to both open-source and closed-source LLMs. Experimental results show that our framework can produce robust and reliable agent workflows. We believe that the automatic generation and interpretation of workflows in natural language represent a promising paradigm for solving complex tasks, particularly with the rapid development of LLMs. The source code of this work is available at https://github.com/agiresearch/AutoFlow.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Large Language Model for Medication Enquiry: Med-Pal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a potential solution to assist digital health development with patient education, commonly medication-related enquires. We trained and validated Med-Pal, a medication domain-specific LLM-chatbot fine-tuned with a fine-grained and expert curated dataset from a selection of five light-weighted open-source LLMs of smaller parameter size (7 billion or less) regarding computational constraints and prioritizing operational efficiency. A multi-disciplinary team performed a clinical evaluation of LLMs responses using the SCORE criteria, focusing on safety, accuracy, bias, reproducibility, and ease of understanding. Best performing light-weighted LLM was chosen as Med-Pal for further engineering with guard-railing using adversarial prompting. Med-Pal and existing light-weighted LLMs, including pretrained Biomistral and finetuned Meerkat, were validated on an independent dataset on a broad range of medication-related questions (231 in total), 12 different question types across 14 different medication classes. Mistral-7b emerged as the top performer among selected lightweight LLMs, achieving the highest median score of 14 and 71.9% high-quality responses in accuracy and safety domains, hence chosen as the backbone LLM for Med-Pal. When compared against Biomistral, Med-pal outperformed in generating responses appropriate for patient communication, with significant reductions bias and errors typical of general LLMs. Comparable performance was observed when comparing Med-Pal with Meerkat. Med-Pal showcases the feasibility of developing and employing fine-tuned light-weighted LLMs to enhance digital health communications.</description>

      <title>WTU-EVAL: A Whether-or-Not Tool Usage Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in NLP tasks, they still need external tools to extend their ability. Current research on tool learning with LLMs often assumes mandatory tool use, which does not always align with real-world situations, where the necessity for tools is uncertain, and incorrect or unnecessary use of tools can damage the general abilities of LLMs. Therefore, we propose to explore whether LLMs can discern their ability boundaries and use tools flexibly. We then introduce the Whether-or-not tool usage Evaluation benchmark (WTU-Eval) to assess LLMs with eleven datasets, where six of them are tool-usage datasets, and five are general datasets. LLMs are prompted to use tools according to their needs. The results of eight LLMs on WTU-Eval reveal that LLMs frequently struggle to determine tool use in general datasets, and LLMs' performance in tool-usage datasets improves when their ability is similar to ChatGPT. In both datasets, incorrect tool usage significantly impairs LLMs' performance. To mitigate this, we also develop the finetuning dataset to enhance tool decision-making. Fine-tuning Llama2-7B results in a 14\% average performance improvement and a 16.8\% decrease in incorrect tool usage. We will release the WTU-Eval benchmark.</description>

      <title>Whispering Experts: Neural Interventions for Toxicity Mitigation in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important issue with Large Language Models (LLMs) is their undesired ability to generate toxic language. In this work, we show that the neurons responsible for toxicity can be determined by their power to discriminate toxic sentences, and that toxic language can be mitigated by reducing their activation levels proportionally to this power. We propose AUROC adaptation (AurA), an intervention that can be applied to any pre-trained LLM to mitigate toxicity. As the intervention is proportional to the ability of each neuron to discriminate toxic content, it is free of any model-dependent hyperparameters. We show that AurA can achieve up to $2.2 \times$ reduction in toxicity with only a $0.72$ perplexity increase. We also show that AurA is effective with models of different scale (from 1.5B to 40B parameters), and its effectiveness in mitigating toxic language, while preserving common-sense zero-shot abilities, holds across all scales. AurA can be combined with pre-prompting strategies, boosting its average mitigation potential from $1.28\times$ to $2.35\times$. Moreover, AurA can counteract adversarial pre-prompts that maliciously elicit toxic content, making it an effective method for deploying safer and less toxic models.</description>

      <title>A Depression Detection Method Based on Multi-Modal Feature Fusion Using Cross-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depression, a prevalent and serious mental health issue, affects approximately 3.8\% of the global population. Despite the existence of effective treatments, over 75\% of individuals in low- and middle-income countries remain untreated, partly due to the challenge in accurately diagnosing depression in its early stages. This paper introduces a novel method for detecting depression based on multi-modal feature fusion utilizing cross-attention. By employing MacBERT as a pre-training model to extract lexical features from text and incorporating an additional Transformer module to refine task-specific contextual understanding, the model's adaptability to the targeted task is enhanced. Diverging from previous practices of simply concatenating multimodal features, this approach leverages cross-attention for feature integration, significantly improving the accuracy in depression detection and enabling a more comprehensive and precise analysis of user emotions and behaviors. Furthermore, a Multi-Modal Feature Fusion Network based on Cross-Attention (MFFNC) is constructed, demonstrating exceptional performance in the task of depression identification. The experimental results indicate that our method achieves an accuracy of 0.9495 on the test dataset, marking a substantial improvement over existing approaches. Moreover, it outlines a promising methodology for other social media platforms and tasks involving multi-modal processing. Timely identification and intervention for individuals with depression are crucial for saving lives, highlighting the immense potential of technology in facilitating early intervention for mental health issues.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Effectiveness of GPT-4o in Climate Change Evidence Synthesis and Systematic Assessments: Preliminary Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research short, we examine the potential of using GPT-4o, a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) to undertake evidence synthesis and systematic assessment tasks. Traditional workflows for such tasks involve large groups of domain experts who manually review and synthesize vast amounts of literature. The exponential growth of scientific literature and recent advances in LLMs provide an opportunity to complementing these traditional workflows with new age tools. We assess the efficacy of GPT-4o to do these tasks on a sample from the dataset created by the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative (GAMI) where we check the accuracy of climate change adaptation related feature extraction from the scientific literature across three levels of expertise. Our results indicate that while GPT-4o can achieve high accuracy in low-expertise tasks like geographic location identification, their performance in intermediate and high-expertise tasks, such as stakeholder identification and assessment of depth of the adaptation response, is less reliable. The findings motivate the need for designing assessment workflows that utilize the strengths of models like GPT-4o while also providing refinements to improve their performance on these tasks.</description>

      <title>The Solution for The PST-KDD-2024 OAG-Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the second-place solution in the KDD-2024 OAG-Challenge paper source tracing track. Our solution is mainly based on two methods, BERT and GCN, and combines the reasoning results of BERT and GCN in the final submission to achieve complementary performance. In the BERT solution, we focus on processing the fragments that appear in the references of the paper, and use a variety of operations to reduce the redundant interference in the fragments, so that the information received by BERT is more refined. In the GCN solution, we map information such as paper fragments, abstracts, and titles to a high-dimensional semantic space through an embedding model, and try to build edges between titles, abstracts, and fragments to integrate contextual relationships for judgment. In the end, our solution achieved a remarkable score of 0.47691 in the competition.</description>

      <title>Why Does New Knowledge Create Messy Ripple Effects in LLMs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive previous research has focused on post-training knowledge editing (KE) for language models (LMs) to ensure that knowledge remains accurate and up-to-date. One desired property and open question in KE is to let edited LMs correctly handle ripple effects, where LM is expected to answer its logically related knowledge accurately. In this paper, we answer the question of why most KE methods still create messy ripple effects. We conduct extensive analysis and identify a salient indicator, GradSim, that effectively reveals when and why updated knowledge ripples in LMs. GradSim is computed by the cosine similarity between gradients of the original fact and its related knowledge. We observe a strong positive correlation between ripple effect performance and GradSim across different LMs, KE methods, and evaluation metrics. Further investigations into three counter-intuitive failure cases (Negation, Over-Ripple, Multi-Lingual) of ripple effects demonstrate that these failures are often associated with very low GradSim. This finding validates that GradSim is an effective indicator of when knowledge ripples in LMs.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-based Consistency Testing of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically expose and measure the inconsistency and knowledge gaps of Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, we propose an automated testing framework (called KONTEST) which leverages a knowledge graph to construct test cases. KONTEST probes and measures the inconsistencies in the LLM's knowledge of the world via a combination of semantically-equivalent queries and test oracles (metamorphic or ontological oracle). KONTEST further mitigates knowledge gaps via a weighted LLM model ensemble. Using four state-of-the-art LLMs (Falcon, Gemini, GPT3.5, and Llama2), we show that KONTEST generates 19.2% error inducing inputs (1917 errors from 9983 test inputs). It also reveals a 16.5% knowledge gap across all tested LLMs. KONTEST's mitigation method reduces LLM knowledge gap by 32.48%. Our ablation study further shows that GPT3.5 is not suitable for knowledge-based consistency testing because it is only 60%-68% effective in knowledge construction.</description>

      <title>Truth is Universal: Robust Detection of Lies in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionised natural language processing, exhibiting impressive human-like capabilities. In particular, LLMs are capable of "lying", knowingly outputting false statements. Hence, it is of interest and importance to develop methods to detect when LLMs lie. Indeed, several authors trained classifiers to detect LLM lies based on their internal model activations. However, other researchers showed that these classifiers may fail to generalise, for example to negated statements. In this work, we aim to develop a robust method to detect when an LLM is lying. To this end, we make the following key contributions: (i) We demonstrate the existence of a two-dimensional subspace, along which the activation vectors of true and false statements can be separated. Notably, this finding is universal and holds for various LLMs, including Gemma-7B, LLaMA2-13B and LLaMA3-8B. Our analysis explains the generalisation failures observed in previous studies and sets the stage for more robust lie detection; (ii) Building upon (i), we construct an accurate LLM lie detector. Empirically, our proposed classifier achieves state-of-the-art performance, distinguishing simple true and false statements with 94% accuracy and detecting more complex real-world lies with 95% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Sentence-level Aggregation of Lexical Metrics Correlate Stronger with Human Judgements than Corpus-level Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that corpus-level aggregation hinders considerably the capability of lexical metrics to accurately evaluate machine translation (MT) systems. With empirical experiments we demonstrate that averaging individual segment-level scores can make metrics such as BLEU and chrF correlate much stronger with human judgements and make them behave considerably more similar to neural metrics such as COMET and BLEURT. We show that this difference exists because corpus- and segment-level aggregation differs considerably owing to the classical average of ratio versus ratio of averages Mathematical problem. Moreover, as we also show, such difference affects considerably the statistical robustness of corpus-level aggregation. Considering that neural metrics currently only cover a small set of sufficiently-resourced languages, the results in this paper can help make the evaluation of MT systems for low-resource languages more trustworthy.</description>

      <title>ESQA: Event Sequences Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event sequences (ESs) arise in many practical domains including finance, retail, social networks, and healthcare. In the context of machine learning, event sequences can be seen as a special type of tabular data with annotated timestamps. Despite the importance of ESs modeling and analysis, little effort was made in adapting large language models (LLMs) to the ESs domain. In this paper, we highlight the common difficulties of ESs processing and propose a novel solution capable of solving multiple downstream tasks with little or no finetuning. In particular, we solve the problem of working with long sequences and improve time and numeric features processing. The resulting method, called ESQA, effectively utilizes the power of LLMs and, according to extensive experiments, achieves state-of-the-art results in the ESs domain.</description>

      <title>Regurgitative Training: The Value of Real Data in Training Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What happens if we train a new Large Language Model (LLM) using data that are at least partially generated by other LLMs? The explosive success of LLMs means that a substantial amount of content online will be generated by LLMs rather than humans, which will inevitably enter the training datasets of next-generation LLMs. We evaluate the implications of such "regurgitative training" on LLM performance. Through fine-tuning GPT-3.5 with data generated either by itself or by other LLMs in a machine translation task, we find strong evidence that regurgitative training clearly handicaps the performance of LLMs. The same performance loss of regurgitative training is observed on transformer models that we train from scratch. We find suggestive evidence that the performance disadvantage of regurgitative training can be attributed to at least two mechanisms: (1) higher error rates and (2) lower lexical diversity in LLM-generated data as compared to real data. Based on these mechanisms, we propose and evaluate three different strategies to mitigate the performance loss of regurgitative training. First, we devise data-driven metrics to gauge the quality of each LLM-generated data instance, and then carry out an ordered training process where high-quality data are added before low-quality ones. Second, we combine data generated by multiple different LLMs (as an attempt to increase lexical diversity). Third, we train an AI detection classifier to differentiate between LLM- and human-generated data, and include LLM-generated data in the order of resemblance to human-generated data. All three strategies can improve the performance of regurgitative training to some extent but are not always able to fully close the gap from training with real data. Our results highlight the value of real, human-generated data in training LLMs, which cannot be easily substituted by synthetic, LLM-generated data.</description>

      <title>OSPC: Artificial VLM Features for Hateful Meme Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The digital revolution and the advent of the world wide web have transformed human communication, notably through the emergence of memes. While memes are a popular and straightforward form of expression, they can also be used to spread misinformation and hate due to their anonymity and ease of use. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces a solution developed by team 'Baseline' for the AI Singapore Online Safety Prize Challenge. Focusing on computational efficiency and feature engineering, the solution achieved an AUROC of 0.76 and an accuracy of 0.69 on the test dataset. As key features, the solution leverages the inherent probabilistic capabilities of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate task-adapted feature encodings from text, and applies a distilled quantization tailored to the specific cultural nuances present in Singapore. This type of processing and fine-tuning can be adapted to various visual and textual understanding and classification tasks, and even applied on private VLMs such as OpenAI's GPT. Finally it can eliminate the need for extensive model training on large GPUs for resource constrained applications, also offering a solution when little or no data is available.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents two significant contributions: first, a novel dataset of 19th-century Latin American press texts, which addresses the lack of specialized corpora for historical and linguistic analysis in this region. Second, it introduces a framework for OCR error correction and linguistic surface form detection in digitized corpora, utilizing a Large Language Model. This framework is adaptable to various contexts and, in this paper, is specifically applied to the newly created dataset.</description>

      <title>What to do if language models disagree? Black-box model ensembling for textual and visual question answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A diverse range of large language models (LLMs), e.g., ChatGPT, and visual question answering (VQA) models, e.g., BLIP, have been developed for solving textual and visual question answering tasks. However, both LLMs and VQA models encounter challenges when applied to task-specific datasets. Fine-tuning these models is either difficult, as it requires access via APIs, rendering them as black-boxes, or costly due to the need of tuning a large number of parameters. To address this, we introduce InfoSel, a data-efficient and lightweight ensemble method that learns to dynamically pick the winner from existing black-box models for predictions on both textual and multimodal visual question answering tasks. Unlike traditional ensemble models, InfoSel does not rely on prediction probabilities or confidences, which typically are not available in black-box models. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves an absolute increase of up to +5.27% in the F1-score compared to standalone LLMs. Remarkably, this improvement is achieved by utilizing only 1K training instances and 110M model parameters for training task-specific ensemble models.</description>

      <title>MS2SL: Multimodal Spoken Data-Driven Continuous Sign Language Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sign language understanding has made significant strides; however, there is still no viable solution for generating sign sequences directly from entire spoken content, e.g., text or speech. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for continuous sign language production, easing communication between sign and non-sign language users. In particular, a sequence diffusion model, utilizing embeddings extracted from text or speech, is crafted to generate sign predictions step by step. Moreover, by creating a joint embedding space for text, audio, and sign, we bind these modalities and leverage the semantic consistency among them to provide informative feedback for the model training. This embedding-consistency learning strategy minimizes the reliance on sign triplets and ensures continuous model refinement, even with a missing audio modality. Experiments on How2Sign and PHOENIX14T datasets demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance in sign language production.</description>

      <title>NutriBench: A Dataset for Evaluating Large Language Models in Carbohydrate Estimation from Meal Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate nutrition estimation helps people make informed decisions about their dietary choices and is crucial for preventing serious health issues. We present NutriBench, the first publicly available natural language meal description based nutrition benchmark. NutriBench consists of 5,000 human-verified meal descriptions with macro-nutrient labels, including carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and calories. The data is divided into 15 subsets varying in complexity based on the number, servings, and popularity of the food items in the meal and the specificity of serving size descriptions. We conducted an extensive evaluation of seven popular and state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-3.5, Llama-3, and a medical domain-specific model with standard, Chain-of-Thought and Retrieval-Augmented Generation strategies on our benchmark for carbohydrate estimation. We also conducted a human study involving expert and non-expert participants and found that LLMs can provide more accurate and faster predictions over a range of complex queries. We present a thorough analysis and comparison of different LLMs, highlighting the opportunities and challenges of using LLMs for nutrition estimation in real-life scenarios. Our benchmark is publicly available at: https://mehak126.github.io/nutribench.html</description>

      <title>$\texttt{metabench}$ -- A Sparse Benchmark to Measure General Ability in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary in their abilities on a range of tasks. Initiatives such as the $\texttt{Open LLM Leaderboard}$ aim to quantify these differences with several large benchmarks (sets of test items to which an LLM can respond either correctly or incorrectly). However, high correlations within and between benchmark scores suggest that (1) there exists a small set of common underlying abilities that these benchmarks measure, and (2) items tap into redundant information and the benchmarks may thus be considerably compressed. We use data from $n &gt; 5000$ LLMs to identify the most informative items of six benchmarks, ARC, GSM8K, HellaSwag, MMLU, TruthfulQA and WinoGrande (with $d=28,632$ items in total). From them we distill a sparse benchmark, $\texttt{metabench}$, that has less than $3\%$ of the original size of all six benchmarks combined. This new sparse benchmark goes beyond point scores by yielding estimators of the underlying benchmark-specific abilities. We show that these estimators (1) can be used to reconstruct each original $\textit{individual}$ benchmark score with, on average, $1.5\%$ root mean square error (RMSE), (2) reconstruct the original $\textit{total}$ score with $0.8\%$ RMSE, and (3) have a single underlying common factor whose Spearman correlation with the total score is $r = 0.93$.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Source of Generation for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) memorize text from several sources of documents. In pretraining, LLM trains to maximize the likelihood of text but neither receives the source of the text nor memorizes the source. Accordingly, LLM can not provide document information on the generated content, and users do not obtain any hint of reliability, which is crucial for factuality or privacy infringement. This work introduces token-level source identification in the decoding step, which maps the token representation to the reference document. We propose a bi-gram source identifier, a multi-layer perceptron with two successive token representations as input for better generalization. We conduct extensive experiments on Wikipedia and PG19 datasets with several LLMs, layer locations, and identifier sizes. The overall results show a possibility of token-level source identifiers for tracing the document, a crucial problem for the safe use of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Aligning Model Evaluations with Human Preferences: Mitigating Token Count Bias in Language Model Assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SLAM paper demonstrated that on-device Small Language Models (SLMs) are a viable and cost-effective alternative to API-based Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's GPT-4, offering comparable performance and stability. However, SLAM also identified discrepancies between human preferences and traditional auto-evaluators. This follow-up paper explores methods to align LLM evaluator preferences with human evaluations by addressing biases, particularly toward higher token counts. We employed Bayesian statistics and a t-test to quantify this bias and developed a recalibration procedure to adjust the GPTScorer. Our findings significantly improve aligning the recalibrated LLM evaluator with human evaluations across multiple use cases. For instance, spearman's ranking correlation score in the Recommendation use case improved from -27.27 to 44.55. These results highlight the importance of accounting for biases in automated evaluations to ensure fair and accurate model assessments. The recalibration process enhances the reliability of automated evaluators, leading to better AI models that align with human values and expectations. This study provides a robust methodology for future research into bias correction and emphasizes the feasibility and benefits of developing human-aligned AI evaluation systems.</description>

      <title>Applicability of Large Language Models and Generative Models for Legal Case Judgement Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic summarization of legal case judgements, which are known to be long and complex, has traditionally been tried via extractive summarization models. In recent years, generative models including abstractive summarization models and Large language models (LLMs) have gained huge popularity. In this paper, we explore the applicability of such models for legal case judgement summarization. We applied various domain specific abstractive summarization models and general domain LLMs as well as extractive summarization models over two sets of legal case judgements from the United Kingdom (UK) Supreme Court and the Indian (IN) Supreme Court and evaluated the quality of the generated summaries. We also perform experiments on a third dataset of legal documents of a different type, Government reports from the United States (US). Results show that abstractive summarization models and LLMs generally perform better than the extractive methods as per traditional metrics for evaluating summary quality. However, detailed investigation shows the presence of inconsistencies and hallucinations in the outputs of the generative models, and we explore ways to reduce the hallucinations and inconsistencies in the summaries. Overall, the investigation suggests that further improvements are needed to enhance the reliability of abstractive models and LLMs for legal case judgement summarization. At present, a human-in-the-loop technique is more suitable for performing manual checks to identify inconsistencies in the generated summaries.</description>

      <title>Limits to Predicting Online Speech Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the predictability of online speech on social media, and whether predictability improves with information outside a user's own posts. Recent work suggests that the predictive information contained in posts written by a user's peers can surpass that of the user's own posts. Motivated by the success of large language models, we empirically test this hypothesis. We define unpredictability as a measure of the model's uncertainty, i.e., its negative log-likelihood on future tokens given context. As the basis of our study, we collect a corpus of 6.25M posts from more than five thousand X (previously Twitter) users and their peers. Across three large language models ranging in size from 1 billion to 70 billion parameters, we find that predicting a user's posts from their peers' posts performs poorly. Moreover, the value of the user's own posts for prediction is consistently higher than that of their peers'. Across the board, we find that the predictability of social media posts remains low, comparable to predicting financial news without context. We extend our investigation with a detailed analysis about the causes of unpredictability and the robustness of our findings. Specifically, we observe that a significant amount of predictive uncertainty comes from hashtags and @-mentions. Moreover, our results replicate if instead of prompting the model with additional context, we finetune on additional context.</description>

      <title>ISPO: An Integrated Ontology of Symptom Phenotypes for Semantic Integration of Traditional Chinese Medical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symptom phenotypes are one of the key types of manifestations for diagnosis and treatment of various disease conditions. However, the diversity of symptom terminologies is one of the major obstacles hindering the analysis and knowledge sharing of various types of symptom-related medical data particularly in the fields of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Objective: This study aimed to construct an Integrated Ontology of symptom phenotypes (ISPO) to support the data mining of Chinese EMRs and real-world study in TCM field. Methods: To construct an integrated ontology of symptom phenotypes (ISPO), we manually annotated classical TCM textbooks and large-scale Chinese electronic medical records (EMRs) to collect symptom terms with support from a medical text annotation system. Furthermore, to facilitate the semantic interoperability between different terminologies, we incorporated public available biomedical vocabularies by manual mapping between Chinese terms and English terms with cross-references to source vocabularies. In addition, we evaluated the ISPO using independent clinical EMRs to provide a high-usable medical ontology for clinical data analysis. Results: By integrating 78,696 inpatient cases of EMRs, 5 biomedical vocabularies, 21 TCM books and dictionaries, ISPO provides 3,147 concepts, 23,475 terms, and 55,552 definition or contextual texts. Adhering to the taxonomical structure of the related anatomical systems of symptom phenotypes, ISPO provides 12 top-level categories and 79 middle-level sub-categories. The validation of data analysis showed the ISPO has a coverage rate of 95.35%, 98.53% and 92.66% for symptom terms with occurrence rates of 0.5% in additional three independent curated clinical datasets, which can demonstrate the significant value of ISPO in mapping clinical terms to ontologies.</description>

      <title>Historical Ink: Semantic Shift Detection for 19th Century Spanish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the evolution of word meanings in 19th-century Spanish texts, with an emphasis on Latin American Spanish, using computational linguistics techniques. It addresses the Semantic Shift Detection (SSD) task, which is crucial for understanding linguistic evolution, particularly in historical contexts. The study focuses on analyzing a set of Spanish target words. To achieve this, a 19th-century Spanish corpus is constructed, and a customizable pipeline for SSD tasks is developed. This pipeline helps find the senses of a word and measure their semantic change between two corpora using fine-tuned BERT-like models with old Spanish texts for both Latin American and general Spanish cases. The results provide valuable insights into the cultural and societal shifts reflected in language changes over time</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Fact-Checking (AFC) is the automated verification of claim accuracy. AFC is crucial in discerning truth from misinformation, especially given the huge amounts of content are generated online daily. Current research focuses on predicting claim veracity through metadata analysis and language scrutiny, with an emphasis on justifying verdicts. This paper surveys recent methodologies, proposing a comprehensive taxonomy and presenting the evolution of research in that landscape. A comparative analysis of methodologies and future directions for improving fact-checking explainability are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Scaling Retrieval-Based Language Models with a Trillion-Token Datastore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling laws with respect to the amount of training data and the number of parameters allow us to predict the cost-benefit trade-offs of pretraining language models (LMs) in different configurations. In this paper, we consider another dimension of scaling: the amount of data available at inference time. Specifically, we find that increasing the size of the datastore used by a retrieval-based LM monotonically improves language modeling and several downstream tasks without obvious saturation, such that a smaller model augmented with a large datastore outperforms a larger LM-only model on knowledge-intensive tasks. By plotting compute-optimal scaling curves with varied datastore, model, and pretraining data sizes, we show that using larger datastores can significantly improve model performance for the same training compute budget. We carry out our study by constructing a 1.4 trillion-token datastore named MassiveDS, which is the largest and the most diverse open-sourced datastore for retrieval-based LMs to date, and designing an efficient pipeline for studying datastore scaling in a computationally accessible manner. Finally, we analyze the effect of improving the retriever, datastore quality filtering, and other design choices on our observed scaling trends. Overall, our results show that datastore size should be considered as an integral part of LM efficiency and performance trade-offs. To facilitate future research, we open-source our datastore and code at https://github.com/RulinShao/retrieval-scaling.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models can impersonate politicians and other public figures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern AI technology like Large language models (LLMs) has the potential to pollute the public information sphere with made-up content, which poses a significant threat to the cohesion of societies at large. A wide range of research has shown that LLMs are capable of generating text of impressive quality, including persuasive political speech, text with a pre-defined style, and role-specific content. But there is a crucial gap in the literature: We lack large-scale and systematic studies of how capable LLMs are in impersonating political and societal representatives and how the general public judges these impersonations in terms of authenticity, relevance and coherence. We present the results of a study based on a cross-section of British society that shows that LLMs are able to generate responses to debate questions that were part of a broadcast political debate programme in the UK. The impersonated responses are judged to be more authentic and relevant than the original responses given by people who were impersonated. This shows two things: (1) LLMs can be made to contribute meaningfully to the public political debate and (2) there is a dire need to inform the general public of the potential harm this can have on society.</description>

      <title>AI AI Bias: Large Language Models Favor Their Own Generated Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Are large language models (LLMs) biased towards text generated by LLMs over text authored by humans, leading to possible anti-human bias? Utilizing a classical experimental design inspired by employment discrimination studies, we tested widely-used LLMs, including GPT-3.5 and GPT4, in binary-choice scenarios. These involved LLM-based agents selecting between products and academic papers described either by humans or LLMs under identical conditions. Our results show a consistent tendency for LLM-based AIs to prefer LLM-generated content. This suggests the possibility of AI systems implicitly discriminating against humans, giving AI agents an unfair advantage.</description>

      <title>Automated Peer Reviewing in Paper SEA: Standardization, Evaluation, and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid increase in scientific papers has overwhelmed traditional review mechanisms, resulting in varying quality of publications. Although existing methods have explored the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated scientific reviewing, their generated contents are often generic or partial. To address the issues above, we introduce an automated paper reviewing framework SEA. It comprises of three modules: Standardization, Evaluation, and Analysis, which are represented by models SEA-S, SEA-E, and SEA-A, respectively. Initially, SEA-S distills data standardization capabilities of GPT-4 for integrating multiple reviews for a paper. Then, SEA-E utilizes standardized data for fine-tuning, enabling it to generate constructive reviews. Finally, SEA-A introduces a new evaluation metric called mismatch score to assess the consistency between paper contents and reviews. Moreover, we design a self-correction strategy to enhance the consistency. Extensive experimental results on datasets collected from eight venues show that SEA can generate valuable insights for authors to improve their papers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the ongoing rapid adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems in high-stakes domains, ensuring the trustworthiness, safety, and observability of these systems has become crucial. It is essential to evaluate and monitor AI systems not only for accuracy and quality-related metrics but also for robustness, bias, security, interpretability, and other responsible AI dimensions. We focus on large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI models, which present additional challenges such as hallucinations, harmful and manipulative content, and copyright infringement. In this survey article accompanying our KDD 2024 tutorial, we highlight a wide range of harms associated with generative AI systems, and survey state of the art approaches (along with open challenges) to address these harms.</description>

      <title>Automated Question Generation on Tabular Data for Conversational Data Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an essential step for analyzing a dataset to derive insights. Several EDA techniques have been explored in the literature. Many of them leverage visualizations through various plots. But it is not easy to interpret them for a non-technical user, and producing appropriate visualizations is also tough when there are a large number of columns. Few other works provide a view of some interesting slices of data but it is still difficult for the user to draw relevant insights from them. Of late, conversational data exploration is gaining a lot of traction among non-technical users. It helps the user to explore the dataset without having deep technical knowledge about the data. Towards this, we propose a system that recommends interesting questions in natural language based on relevant slices of a dataset in a conversational setting. Specifically, given a dataset, we pick a select set of interesting columns and identify interesting slices of such columns and column combinations based on few interestingness measures. We use our own fine-tuned variation of a pre-trained language model(T5) to generate natural language questions in a specific manner. We then slot-fill values in the generated questions and rank them for recommendations. We show the utility of our proposed system in a coversational setting with a collection of real datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Simplified Text-Attributed Graph Embeddings (STAGE), a straightforward yet effective method for enhancing node features in Graph Neural Network (GNN) models that encode Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs). Our approach leverages Large-Language Models (LLMs) to generate embeddings for textual attributes. STAGE achieves competitive results on various node classification benchmarks while also maintaining a simplicity in implementation relative to current state-of-the-art (SoTA) techniques. We show that utilizing pre-trained LLMs as embedding generators provides robust features for ensemble GNN training, enabling pipelines that are simpler than current SoTA approaches which require multiple expensive training and prompting stages. We also implement diffusion-pattern GNNs in an effort to make this pipeline scalable to graphs beyond academic benchmarks.</description>

      <title>CiteME: Can Language Models Accurately Cite Scientific Claims?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thousands of new scientific papers are published each month. Such information overload complicates researcher efforts to stay current with the state-of-the-art as well as to verify and correctly attribute claims. We pose the following research question: Given a text excerpt referencing a paper, could an LM act as a research assistant to correctly identify the referenced paper? We advance efforts to answer this question by building a benchmark that evaluates the abilities of LMs in citation attribution. Our benchmark, CiteME, consists of text excerpts from recent machine learning papers, each referencing a single other paper. CiteME use reveals a large gap between frontier LMs and human performance, with LMs achieving only 4.2-18.5% accuracy and humans 69.7%. We close this gap by introducing CiteAgent, an autonomous system built on the GPT-4o LM that can also search and read papers, which achieves an accuracy of 35.3\% on CiteME. Overall, CiteME serves as a challenging testbed for open-ended claim attribution, driving the research community towards a future where any claim made by an LM can be automatically verified and discarded if found to be incorrect.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Large language models chatbots: An experimental approach using a probability test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study consists of qualitative empirical research, conducted through exploratory tests with two different Large Language Models (LLMs) chatbots: ChatGPT and Gemini. The methodological procedure involved exploratory tests based on prompts designed with a probability question. The "Linda Problem", widely recognized in cognitive psychology, was used as a basis to create the tests, along with the development of a new problem specifically for this experiment, the "Mary Problem". The object of analysis is the dataset with the outputs provided by each chatbot interaction. The purpose of the analysis is to verify whether the chatbots mainly employ logical reasoning that aligns with probability theory or if they are more frequently affected by the stereotypical textual descriptions in the prompts. The findings provide insights about the approach each chatbot employs in handling logic and textual constructions, suggesting that, while the analyzed chatbots perform satisfactorily on a well-known probabilistic problem, they exhibit significantly lower performance on new tests that require direct application of probabilistic logic.</description>

      <title>Token-Supervised Value Models for Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive problem-solving capabilities in mathematics through step-by-step reasoning chains. However, they are susceptible to reasoning errors that impact the quality of subsequent reasoning chains and the final answer due to language models' autoregressive token-by-token generating nature. Recent works have proposed adopting external verifiers to guide the generation of reasoning paths, but existing works utilize models that have been trained with step-by-step labels to assess the correctness of token-by-token reasoning chains. Consequently, they struggle to recognize discriminative details of tokens within a reasoning path and lack the ability to evaluate whether an intermediate reasoning path is on a promising track toward the correct final answer. To amend the lack of sound and token-grained math-verification signals, we devise a novel training scheme for verifiers that apply token-level supervision with the expected cumulative reward (i.e., value). Furthermore, we propose a practical formulation of the cumulative reward by reducing it to finding the probability of future correctness of the final answer and thereby enabling the empirical estimation of the value. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that Token-Supervised Value Model (TVM) can outperform step-by-step verifiers on GSM8K and MATH with Mistral and Llama.</description>

      <title>GRAD-SUM: Leveraging Gradient Summarization for Optimal Prompt Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt engineering for large language models (LLMs) is often a manual time-intensive process that involves generating, evaluating, and refining prompts iteratively to ensure high-quality outputs. While there has been work on automating prompt engineering, the solutions generally are either tuned to specific tasks with given answers or are quite costly. We introduce GRAD-SUM, a scalable and flexible method for automatic prompt engineering that builds on gradient-based optimization techniques. Our approach incorporates user-defined task descriptions and evaluation criteria, and features a novel gradient summarization module to generalize feedback effectively. Our results demonstrate that GRAD-SUM consistently outperforms existing methods across various benchmarks, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness in automatic prompt optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, particularly in contexts where computational resources are limited. Traditional attention mechanisms in these models, while powerful, require significant computational and memory resources due to the necessity of recalculating and storing attention weights across different layers. This paper introduces a novel Shared Attention (SA) mechanism, designed to enhance the efficiency of LLMs by directly sharing computed attention weights across multiple layers. Unlike previous methods that focus on sharing intermediate Key-Value (KV) caches, our approach utilizes the isotropic tendencies of attention distributions observed in advanced LLMs post-pretraining to reduce both the computational flops and the size of the KV cache required during inference. We empirically demonstrate that implementing SA across various LLMs results in minimal accuracy loss on standard benchmarks. Our findings suggest that SA not only conserves computational resources but also maintains robust model performance, thereby facilitating the deployment of more efficient LLMs in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Bilingual Adaptation of Monolingual Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient method for adapting a monolingual Large Language Model (LLM) to another language, addressing challenges of catastrophic forgetting and tokenizer limitations. We focus this study on adapting Llama 2 to Arabic. Our two-stage approach begins with expanding the vocabulary and training only the embeddings matrix, followed by full model continual pretraining on a bilingual corpus. By continually pretraining on a mix of Arabic and English corpora, the model retains its proficiency in English while acquiring capabilities in Arabic. Our approach results in significant improvements in Arabic and slight enhancements in English, demonstrating cost-effective cross-lingual transfer. We also perform extensive ablations on embedding initialization techniques, data mix ratios, and learning rates and release a detailed training recipe.</description>

      <title>MetaTool: Facilitating Large Language Models to Master Tools with Meta-task Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing complex tools with Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical component for grounding AI agents in various real-world scenarios. The core challenge of manipulating tools lies in understanding their usage and functionality. The prevailing approach involves few-shot prompting with demonstrations or fine-tuning on expert trajectories. However, for complex tools and tasks, mere in-context demonstrations may fail to cover sufficient knowledge. Training-based methods are also constrained by the high cost of dataset construction and limited generalizability. In this paper, we introduce a new tool learning methodology (MetaTool) that is generalizable for mastering any reusable toolset. Our approach includes a self-supervised data augmentation technique that enables LLMs to gain a comprehensive understanding of various tools, thereby improving their ability to complete tasks effectively. We develop a series of meta-tasks that involve predicting masked factors of tool execution. These self-supervised tasks enable the automatic generation of high-quality QA data concerning tool comprehension. By incorporating meta-task data into the instruction tuning process, the proposed MetaTool model achieves significant superiority to open-source models and is comparable to GPT-4/GPT-3.5 on multiple tool-oriented tasks.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models with fmeval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: fmeval is an open source library to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in a range of tasks. It helps practitioners evaluate their model for task performance and along multiple responsible AI dimensions. This paper presents the library and exposes its underlying design principles: simplicity, coverage, extensibility and performance. We then present how these were implemented in the scientific and engineering choices taken when developing fmeval. A case study demonstrates a typical use case for the library: picking a suitable model for a question answering task. We close by discussing limitations and further work in the development of the library. fmeval can be found at https://github.com/aws/fmeval.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of RAG Metrics for Question Answering in the Telecom Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely used to enable Large Language Models (LLMs) perform Question Answering (QA) tasks in various domains. However, RAG based on open-source LLM for specialized domains has challenges of evaluating generated responses. A popular framework in the literature is the RAG Assessment (RAGAS), a publicly available library which uses LLMs for evaluation. One disadvantage of RAGAS is the lack of details of derivation of numerical value of the evaluation metrics. One of the outcomes of this work is a modified version of this package for few metrics (faithfulness, context relevance, answer relevance, answer correctness, answer similarity and factual correctness) through which we provide the intermediate outputs of the prompts by using any LLMs. Next, we analyse the expert evaluations of the output of the modified RAGAS package and observe the challenges of using it in the telecom domain. We also study the effect of the metrics under correct vs. wrong retrieval and observe that few of the metrics have higher values for correct retrieval. We also study for differences in metrics between base embeddings and those domain adapted via pre-training and fine-tuning. Finally, we comment on the suitability and challenges of using these metrics for in-the-wild telecom QA task.</description>

      <title>SELF-GUIDE: Better Task-Specific Instruction Following via Self-Synthetic Finetuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold the promise of solving diverse tasks when provided with appropriate natural language prompts. However, prompting often leads models to make predictions with lower accuracy compared to finetuning a model with ample training data. On the other hand, while finetuning LLMs on task-specific data generally improves their performance, abundant annotated datasets are not available for all tasks. Previous work has explored generating task-specific data from state-of-the-art LLMs and using this data to finetune smaller models, but this approach requires access to a language model other than the one being trained, which introduces cost, scalability challenges, and legal hurdles associated with continuously relying on more powerful LLMs. In response to these, we propose SELF-GUIDE, a multi-stage mechanism in which we synthesize task-specific input-output pairs from the student LLM, then use these input-output pairs to finetune the student LLM itself. In our empirical evaluation of the Natural Instructions V2 benchmark, we find that SELF-GUIDE improves the performance of LLM by a substantial margin. Specifically, we report an absolute improvement of approximately 15% for classification tasks and 18% for generation tasks in the benchmark's metrics. This sheds light on the promise of self-synthesized data guiding LLMs towards becoming task-specific experts without any external learning signals.</description>

      <title>Review-Feedback-Reason (ReFeR): A Novel Framework for NLG Evaluation and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing the quality of Natural Language Generation (NLG) outputs, such as those produced by large language models (LLMs), poses significant challenges. Traditional approaches involve either resource-intensive human evaluations or automatic metrics, which often exhibit a low correlation with human judgment. In this study, we propose Review-Feedback-Reason (ReFeR), a novel evaluation framework for NLG using LLM agents. We rigorously test ReFeR using two pre-existing benchmark datasets on diverse NLG tasks. The proposed framework not only enhances the accuracy of NLG evaluation, surpassing previous benchmarks by $\sim$20\%, but also generates constructive feedback and significantly improves collective reasoning. This feedback is then leveraged for the creation of instruction-tuning datasets, which, when used to fine-tune smaller models like Mistral-7B, makes them extremely good evaluators, yielding a better correlation with human evaluations and performance nearly on par with GPT-3.5. We highlight the effectiveness of our methodology through its application on three reasoning benchmarks, where it outperforms most of the state-of-the-art methods, and also outperforms the reasoning capabilities of models like GPT-3.5 Turbo by $\sim$11.67\% and GPT-4 by $\sim$1\% on an average.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs have Consistent Values?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Values are a basic driving force underlying human behavior. Large Language Models (LLM) technology is constantly improving towards human-like dialogue. However, little research has been done to study the values exhibited in text generated by LLMs. Here we study this question by turning to the rich literature on value structure in psychology. We ask whether LLMs exhibit the same value structure that has been demonstrated in humans, including the ranking of values, and correlation between values. We show that the results of this analysis strongly depend on how the LLM is prompted, and that under a particular prompting strategy (referred to as 'Value Anchoring') the agreement with human data is quite compelling. Our results serve both to improve our understanding of values in LLMs, as well as introduce novel methods for assessing consistency in LLM responses.</description>

      <title>Large Visual-Language Models Are Also Good Classifiers: A Study of In-Context Multimodal Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large visual-language models (LVLMs) exhibit exceptional performance in visual-language reasoning across diverse cross-modal benchmarks. Despite these advances, recent research indicates that Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-3.5-turbo, underachieve compared to well-trained smaller models, such as BERT, in Fake News Detection (FND), prompting inquiries into LVLMs' efficacy in FND tasks. Although performance could improve through fine-tuning LVLMs, the substantial parameters and requisite pre-trained weights render it a resource-heavy endeavor for FND applications. This paper initially assesses the FND capabilities of two notable LVLMs, CogVLM and GPT4V, in comparison to a smaller yet adeptly trained CLIP model in a zero-shot context. The findings demonstrate that LVLMs can attain performance competitive with that of the smaller model. Next, we integrate standard in-context learning (ICL) with LVLMs, noting improvements in FND performance, though limited in scope and consistency. To address this, we introduce the \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{F}ake \textbf{N}ews \textbf{D}etection (IMFND) framework, enriching in-context examples and test inputs with predictions and corresponding probabilities from a well-trained smaller model. This strategic integration directs the LVLMs' focus towards news segments associated with higher probabilities, thereby improving their analytical accuracy. The experimental results suggest that the IMFND framework significantly boosts the FND efficiency of LVLMs, achieving enhanced accuracy over the standard ICL approach across three publicly available FND datasets.</description>

Abstract: Real world deployments of word alignment are almost certain to cover both high and low resource languages. However, the state-of-the-art for this task recommends a different model class depending on the availability of gold alignment training data for a particular language pair. We propose BinaryAlign, a novel word alignment technique based on binary sequence labeling that outperforms existing approaches in both scenarios, offering a unifying approach to the task. Additionally, we vary the specific choice of multilingual foundation model, perform stratified error analysis over alignment error type, and explore the performance of BinaryAlign on non-English language pairs. We make our source code publicly available.</description>

      <title>InstructAV: Instruction Fine-tuning Large Language Models for Authorship Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in a wide range of NLP tasks. However, when it comes to authorship verification (AV) tasks, which involve determining whether two given texts share the same authorship, even advanced models like ChatGPT exhibit notable limitations. This paper introduces a novel approach, termed InstructAV, for authorship verification. This approach utilizes LLMs in conjunction with a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method to simultaneously improve accuracy and explainability. The distinctiveness of InstructAV lies in its ability to align classification decisions with transparent and understandable explanations, representing a significant progression in the field of authorship verification. Through comprehensive experiments conducted across various datasets, InstructAV demonstrates its state-of-the-art performance on the AV task, offering high classification accuracy coupled with enhanced explanation reliability.</description>

      <title>BRIGHT: A Realistic and Challenging Benchmark for Reasoning-Intensive Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing retrieval benchmarks primarily consist of information-seeking queries (e.g., aggregated questions from search engines) where keyword or semantic-based retrieval is usually sufficient. However, many complex real-world queries require in-depth reasoning to identify relevant documents that go beyond surface form matching. For example, finding documentation for a coding question requires understanding the logic and syntax of the functions involved. To better benchmark retrieval on such challenging queries, we introduce BRIGHT, the first text retrieval benchmark that requires intensive reasoning to retrieve relevant documents. BRIGHT is constructed from the 1,398 real-world queries collected from diverse domains (such as economics, psychology, robotics, software engineering, earth sciences, etc.), sourced from naturally occurring or carefully curated human data. Extensive evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art retrieval models perform poorly on BRIGHT. The leading model on the MTEB leaderboard [38 ], which achieves a score of 59.0 nDCG@10,2 produces a score of nDCG@10 of 18.0 on BRIGHT. We further demonstrate that augmenting queries with Chain-of-Thought reasoning generated by large language models (LLMs) improves performance by up to 12.2 points. Moreover, BRIGHT is robust against data leakage during pretraining of the benchmarked models as we validate by showing similar performance even when documents from the benchmark are included in the training data. We believe that BRIGHT paves the way for future research on retrieval systems in more realistic and challenging settings. Our code and data are available at https://brightbenchmark.github.io.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sentence embedding is a cornerstone in NLP. Whitening has been claimed to be an effective operation to improve embedding quality obtained from Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we find that the efficacy of whitening is model-dependent and task-dependent. In particular, whitening degenerates embeddings for classification tasks. The conclusion is supported by extensive experiments. We also explored a variety of whitening operations, including PCA, ZCA, PCA-Cor, ZCA-Cor and Cholesky whitenings. A by-product of our research is embedding evaluation platform for LLMs called SentEval+.</description>

      <title>Explainable Biomedical Hypothesis Generation via Retrieval Augmented Generation enabled Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vast amount of biomedical information available today presents a significant challenge for investigators seeking to digest, process, and understand these findings effectively. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools to navigate this complex and challenging data landscape. However, LLMs may lead to hallucinatory responses, making Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) crucial for achieving accurate information. In this protocol, we present RUGGED (Retrieval Under Graph-Guided Explainable disease Distinction), a comprehensive workflow designed to support investigators with knowledge integration and hypothesis generation, identifying validated paths forward. Relevant biomedical information from publications and knowledge bases are reviewed, integrated, and extracted via text-mining association analysis and explainable graph prediction models on disease nodes, forecasting potential links among drugs and diseases. These analyses, along with biomedical texts, are integrated into a framework that facilitates user-directed mechanism elucidation as well as hypothesis exploration through RAG-enabled LLMs. A clinical use-case demonstrates RUGGED's ability to evaluate and recommend therapeutics for Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (ACM) and Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM), analyzing prescribed drugs for molecular interactions and unexplored uses. The platform minimizes LLM hallucinations, offers actionable insights, and improves the investigation of novel therapeutics.</description>

      <title>Halu-J: Critique-Based Hallucination Judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate non-factual content, known as hallucinations. Existing retrieval-augmented-based hallucination detection approaches typically address this by framing it as a classification task, evaluating hallucinations based on their consistency with retrieved evidence. However, this approach usually lacks detailed explanations for these evaluations and does not assess the reliability of these explanations. Furthermore, deficiencies in retrieval systems can lead to irrelevant or partially relevant evidence retrieval, impairing the detection process. Moreover, while real-world hallucination detection requires analyzing multiple pieces of evidence, current systems usually treat all evidence uniformly without considering its relevance to the content. To address these challenges, we introduce Halu-J, a critique-based hallucination judge with 7 billion parameters. Halu-J enhances hallucination detection by selecting pertinent evidence and providing detailed critiques. Our experiments indicate that Halu-J outperforms GPT-4o in multiple-evidence hallucination detection and matches its capability in critique generation and evidence selection. We also introduce ME-FEVER, a new dataset designed for multiple-evidence hallucination detection. Our code and dataset can be found in https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/factool .</description>

      <title>A Survey of Prompt Engineering Methods in Large Language Models for Different NLP Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on many different Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Prompt engineering plays a key role in adding more to the already existing abilities of LLMs to achieve significant performance gains on various NLP tasks. Prompt engineering requires composing natural language instructions called prompts to elicit knowledge from LLMs in a structured way. Unlike previous state-of-the-art (SoTA) models, prompt engineering does not require extensive parameter re-training or fine-tuning based on the given NLP task and thus solely operates on the embedded knowledge of LLMs. Additionally, LLM enthusiasts can intelligently extract LLMs' knowledge through a basic natural language conversational exchange or prompt engineering, allowing more and more people even without deep mathematical machine learning background to experiment with LLMs. With prompt engineering gaining popularity in the last two years, researchers have come up with numerous engineering techniques around designing prompts to improve accuracy of information extraction from the LLMs. In this paper, we summarize different prompting techniques and club them together based on different NLP tasks that they have been used for. We further granularly highlight the performance of these prompting strategies on various datasets belonging to that NLP task, talk about the corresponding LLMs used, present a taxonomy diagram and discuss the possible SoTA for specific datasets. In total, we read and present a survey of 44 research papers which talk about 39 different prompting methods on 29 different NLP tasks of which most of them have been published in the last two years.</description>

      <title>Turkish Delights: a Dataset on Turkish Euphemisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Euphemisms are a form of figurative language relatively understudied in natural language processing. This research extends the current computational work on potentially euphemistic terms (PETs) to Turkish. We introduce the Turkish PET dataset, the first available of its kind in the field. By creating a list of euphemisms in Turkish, collecting example contexts, and annotating them, we provide both euphemistic and non-euphemistic examples of PETs in Turkish. We describe the dataset and methodologies, and also experiment with transformer-based models on Turkish euphemism detection by using our dataset for binary classification. We compare performances across models using F1, accuracy, and precision as evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Establishing Knowledge Preference in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models are known to encode a great amount of factual knowledge through pretraining. However, such knowledge might be insufficient to cater to user requests, requiring the model to integrate external knowledge sources and adhere to user-provided specifications. When answering questions about ongoing events, the model should use recent news articles to update its response; when asked to provide recommendations, the model should prioritize user specifications over retrieved product reviews; when some facts are edited in the model, the updated facts should override all prior knowledge learned by the model even if they are conflicting. In all of the cases above, the model faces a decision between its own parametric knowledge, (retrieved) contextual knowledge, and user instruction knowledge. In this paper, we (1) unify such settings into the problem of knowledge preference and define a three-level preference hierarchy over these knowledge sources; (2) compile a collection of existing datasets IfQA, MQuAKE, and MRQA covering a combination of settings (with/without user specifications, with/without context documents) to systematically evaluate how well models obey the intended knowledge preference; and (3) propose a dataset synthesis method that composes diverse question-answer pairs with user assumptions and related context to directly fine-tune LMs for instilling the hierarchy of knowledge. We demonstrate that a 7B model, fine-tuned on only a few thousand examples automatically generated by our proposed method, effectively achieves superior performance (more than 18% improvement across all evaluation benchmarks) in adhering to the desired knowledge preference hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Sentiment Analysis with Local Large Language Models using Majority Voting: A Study on Factors Affecting Restaurant Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User-generated contents (UGCs) on online platforms allow marketing researchers to understand consumer preferences for products and services. With the advance of large language models (LLMs), some studies utilized the models for annotation and sentiment analysis. However, the relationship between the accuracy and the hyper-parameters of LLMs is yet to be thoroughly examined. In addition, the issues of variability and reproducibility of results from each trial of LLMs have rarely been considered in existing literature. Since actual human annotation uses majority voting to resolve disagreements among annotators, this study introduces a majority voting mechanism to a sentiment analysis model using local LLMs. By a series of three analyses of online reviews on restaurant evaluations, we demonstrate that majority voting with multiple attempts using a medium-sized model produces more robust results than using a large model with a single attempt. Furthermore, we conducted further analysis to investigate the effect of each aspect on the overall evaluation.</description>

      <title>AlcLaM: Arabic Dialectal Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are integral to many modern natural language processing (NLP) systems. Although multilingual models cover a wide range of languages, they often grapple with challenges like high inference costs and a lack of diverse non-English training data. Arabic-specific PLMs are trained predominantly on modern standard Arabic, which compromises their performance on regional dialects. To tackle this, we construct an Arabic dialectal corpus comprising 3.4M sentences gathered from social media platforms. We utilize this corpus to expand the vocabulary and retrain a BERT-based model from scratch. Named AlcLaM, our model was trained using only 13 GB of text, which represents a fraction of the data used by existing models such as CAMeL, MARBERT, and ArBERT, compared to 7.8%, 10.2%, and 21.3%, respectively. Remarkably, AlcLaM demonstrates superior performance on a variety of Arabic NLP tasks despite the limited training data. AlcLaM is available at GitHub https://github.com/amurtadha/Alclam and HuggingFace https://huggingface.co/rahbi.</description>

      <title>Retrieve, Summarize, Plan: Advancing Multi-hop Question Answering with an Iterative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-hop question answering is a challenging task with distinct industrial relevance, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods based on large language models (LLMs) have become a popular approach to tackle this task. Owing to the potential inability to retrieve all necessary information in a single iteration, a series of iterative RAG methods has been recently developed, showing significant performance improvements. However, existing methods still face two critical challenges: context overload resulting from multiple rounds of retrieval, and over-planning and repetitive planning due to the lack of a recorded retrieval trajectory. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative RAG method called ReSP, equipped with a dual-function summarizer. This summarizer compresses information from retrieved documents, targeting both the overarching question and the current sub-question concurrently. Experimental results on the multi-hop question-answering datasets HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, and exhibits excellent robustness concerning context length.</description>

      <title>A light-weight and efficient punctuation and word casing prediction model for on-device streaming ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Punctuation and word casing prediction are necessary for automatic speech recognition (ASR). With the popularity of on-device end-to-end streaming ASR systems, the on-device punctuation and word casing prediction become a necessity while we found little discussion on this. With the emergence of Transformer, Transformer based models have been explored for this scenario. However, Transformer based models are too large for on-device ASR systems. In this paper, we propose a light-weight and efficient model that jointly predicts punctuation and word casing in real time. The model is based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM). Experimental results on the IWSLT2011 test set show that the proposed model obtains 9% relative improvement compared to the best of non-Transformer models on overall F1-score. Compared to the representative of Transformer based models, the proposed model achieves comparable results to the representative model while being only one-fortieth its size and 2.5 times faster in terms of inference time. It is suitable for on-device streaming ASR systems. Our code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Preset-Voice Matching for Privacy Regulated Speech-to-Speech Translation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been increased demand for speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) systems in industry settings. Although successfully commercialized, cloning-based S2ST systems expose their distributors to liabilities when misused by individuals and can infringe on personality rights when exploited by media organizations. This work proposes a regulated S2ST framework called Preset-Voice Matching (PVM). PVM removes cross-lingual voice cloning in S2ST by first matching the input voice to a similar prior consenting speaker voice in the target-language. With this separation, PVM avoids cloning the input speaker, ensuring PVM systems comply with regulations and reduce risk of misuse. Our results demonstrate PVM can significantly improve S2ST system run-time in multi-speaker settings and the naturalness of S2ST synthesized speech. To our knowledge, PVM is the first explicitly regulated S2ST framework leveraging similarly-matched preset-voices for dynamic S2ST tasks.</description>

      <title>Translate-and-Revise: Boosting Large Language Models for Constrained Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imposing constraints on machine translation systems presents a challenging issue because these systems are not trained to make use of constraints in generating adequate, fluent translations. In this paper, we leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for constrained translation, given that LLMs can easily adapt to this task by taking translation instructions and constraints as prompts. However, LLMs cannot always guarantee the adequacy of translation, and, in some cases, ignore the given constraints. This is in part because LLMs might be overly confident in their predictions, overriding the influence of the constraints. To overcome this overiding behaviour, we propose to add a revision process that encourages LLMs to correct the outputs by prompting them about the constraints that have not yet been met. We evaluate our approach on four constrained translation tasks, encompassing both lexical and structural constraints in multiple constraint domains. Experiments show 15\% improvement in constraint-based translation accuracy over standard LLMs and the approach also significantly outperforms neural machine translation (NMT) state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great success in various fields, benefiting from their huge amount of parameters that store knowledge. However, LLMs still suffer from several key issues, such as hallucination problems, knowledge update issues, and lacking domain-specific expertise. The appearance of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which leverages an external knowledge database to augment LLMs, makes up those drawbacks of LLMs. This paper reviews all significant techniques of RAG, especially in the retriever and the retrieval fusions. Besides, tutorial codes are provided for implementing the representative techniques in RAG. This paper further discusses the RAG training, including RAG with/without datastore update. Then, we introduce the application of RAG in representative natural language processing tasks and industrial scenarios. Finally, this paper discusses the future directions and challenges of RAG for promoting its development.</description>

Abstract: The transformers have achieved significant accomplishments in the natural language processing as its outstanding parallel processing capabilities and highly flexible attention mechanism. In addition, increasing studies based on transformers have been proposed to model single-cell data. In this review, we attempt to systematically summarize the single-cell language models and applications based on transformers. First, we provide a detailed introduction about the structure and principles of transformers. Then, we review the single-cell language models and large language models for single-cell data analysis. Moreover, we explore the datasets and applications of single-cell language models in downstream tasks such as batch correction, cell clustering, cell type annotation, gene regulatory network inference and perturbation response. Further, we discuss the challenges of single-cell language models and provide promising research directions. We hope this review will serve as an up-to-date reference for researchers interested in the direction of single-cell language models.</description>

Abstract: We aim to evaluate the efficacy of traditional machine learning and large language models (LLMs) in classifying anxiety and depression from long conversational transcripts. We fine-tune both established transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa, Longformer) and more recent large models (Mistral-7B), trained a Support Vector Machine with feature engineering, and assessed GPT models through prompting. We observe that state-of-the-art models fail to enhance classification outcomes compared to traditional machine learning methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to semi-automate some process mining (PM) analyses. While commercial models are already adequate for many analytics tasks, the competitive level of open-source LLMs in PM tasks is unknown. In this paper, we propose PM-LLM-Benchmark, the first comprehensive benchmark for PM focusing on domain knowledge (process-mining-specific and process-specific) and on different implementation strategies. We focus also on the challenges in creating such a benchmark, related to the public availability of the data and on evaluation biases by the LLMs. Overall, we observe that most of the considered LLMs can perform some process mining tasks at a satisfactory level, but tiny models that would run on edge devices are still inadequate. We also conclude that while the proposed benchmark is useful for identifying LLMs that are adequate for process mining tasks, further research is needed to overcome the evaluation biases and perform a more thorough ranking of the competitive LLMs.</description>

      <title>Are Large Language Models Capable of Generating Human-Level Narratives?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the capability of LLMs in storytelling, focusing on narrative development and plot progression. We introduce a novel computational framework to analyze narratives through three discourse-level aspects: i) story arcs, ii) turning points, and iii) affective dimensions, including arousal and valence. By leveraging expert and automatic annotations, we uncover significant discrepancies between the LLM- and human- written stories. While human-written stories are suspenseful, arousing, and diverse in narrative structures, LLM stories are homogeneously positive and lack tension. Next, we measure narrative reasoning skills as a precursor to generative capacities, concluding that most LLMs fall short of human abilities in discourse understanding. Finally, we show that explicit integration of aforementioned discourse features can enhance storytelling, as is demonstrated by over 40% improvement in neural storytelling in terms of diversity, suspense, and arousal.</description>

      <title>SpeciaLex: A Benchmark for In-Context Specialized Lexicon Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Specialized lexicons are collections of words with associated constraints such as special definitions, specific roles, and intended target audiences. These constraints are necessary for content generation and documentation tasks (e.g., writing technical manuals or children's books), where the goal is to reduce the ambiguity of text content and increase its overall readability for a specific group of audience. Understanding how large language models can capture these constraints can help researchers build better, more impactful tools for wider use beyond the NLP community. Towards this end, we introduce SpeciaLex, a benchmark for evaluating a language model's ability to follow specialized lexicon-based constraints across 18 diverse subtasks with 1,285 test instances covering core tasks of Checking, Identification, Rewriting, and Open Generation. We present an empirical evaluation of 15 open and closed-source LLMs and discuss insights on how factors such as model scale, openness, setup, and recency affect performance upon evaluating with the benchmark.</description>

      <title>Robust ASR Error Correction with Conservative Data Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error correction (EC) based on large language models is an emerging technology to enhance the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Generally, training data for EC are collected by automatically pairing a large set of ASR hypotheses (as sources) and their gold references (as targets). However, the quality of such pairs is not guaranteed, and we observed various types of noise which can make the EC models brittle, e.g. inducing overcorrection in out-of-domain (OOD) settings. In this work, we propose two fundamental criteria that EC training data should satisfy: namely, EC targets should (1) improve linguistic acceptability over sources and (2) be inferable from the available context (e.g. source phonemes). Through these criteria, we identify low-quality EC pairs and train the models not to make any correction in such cases, the process we refer to as conservative data filtering. In our experiments, we focus on Japanese ASR using a strong Conformer-CTC as the baseline and finetune Japanese LLMs for EC. Through our evaluation on a suite of 21 internal benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach can significantly reduce overcorrection and improve both the accuracy and quality of ASR results in the challenging OOD settings.</description>

      <title>CoD, Towards an Interpretable Medical Agent using Chain of Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of medical diagnosis has undergone a significant transformation with the advent of large language models (LLMs), yet the challenges of interpretability within these models remain largely unaddressed. This study introduces Chain-of-Diagnosis (CoD) to enhance the interpretability of LLM-based medical diagnostics. CoD transforms the diagnostic process into a diagnostic chain that mirrors a physician's thought process, providing a transparent reasoning pathway. Additionally, CoD outputs the disease confidence distribution to ensure transparency in decision-making. This interpretability makes model diagnostics controllable and aids in identifying critical symptoms for inquiry through the entropy reduction of confidences. With CoD, we developed DiagnosisGPT, capable of diagnosing 9604 diseases. Experimental results demonstrate that DiagnosisGPT outperforms other LLMs on diagnostic benchmarks. Moreover, DiagnosisGPT provides interpretability while ensuring controllability in diagnostic rigor.</description>

      <title>Why do you cite? An investigation on citation intents and decision-making classification processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the reason for which an author cites another work is essential to understand the nature of scientific contributions and to assess their impact. Citations are one of the pillars of scholarly communication and most metrics employed to analyze these conceptual links are based on quantitative observations. Behind the act of referencing another scholarly work there is a whole world of meanings that needs to be proficiently and effectively revealed. This study emphasizes the importance of trustfully classifying citation intents to provide more comprehensive and insightful analyses in research assessment. We address this task by presenting a study utilizing advanced Ensemble Strategies for Citation Intent Classification (CIC) incorporating Language Models (LMs) and employing Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness of models' predictions. Our approach involves two ensemble classifiers that utilize fine-tuned SciBERT and XLNet LMs as baselines. We further demonstrate the critical role of section titles as a feature in improving models' performances. The study also introduces a web application developed with Flask and currently available at http://137.204.64.4:81/cic/classifier, aimed at classifying citation intents. One of our models sets as a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) with an 89.46% Macro-F1 score on the SciCite benchmark. The integration of XAI techniques provides insights into the decision-making processes, highlighting the contributions of individual words for level-0 classifications, and of individual models for the metaclassification. The findings suggest that the inclusion of section titles significantly enhances classification performances in the CIC task. Our contributions provide useful insights for developing more robust datasets and methodologies, thus fostering a deeper understanding of scholarly communication.</description>

      <title>Learning-From-Mistakes Prompting for Indigenous Language Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using large language models, this paper presents techniques to improve extremely low-resourced indigenous language translations. Our approaches are grounded in the use of (1) the presence of a datastore consisting of a limited number of parallel translation examples, (2) the inherent capabilities of LLMs like GPT-3.5, and (3) a word-level translation dictionary. We harness the potential of LLMs and in-context learning techniques in such a setting for using LLMs as universal translators for extremely low-resourced languages. Our methodology hinges on utilizing LLMs as language compilers for selected language pairs, hypothesizing that they could internalize syntactic structures to facilitate accurate translation. We introduce three techniques: KNNPrompting with Retrieved Prompting Context, Chain-of-Thought Prompting and Learningfrom-Mistakes Prompting, with the last method addressing past errors. The evaluation results suggest that, even with limited corpora, LLMs can effectively translate extremely low-resource languages when paired with proper prompting.</description>

      <title>Capturing Style in Author and Document Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide range of Deep Natural Language Processing (NLP) models integrates continuous and low dimensional representations of words and documents. Surprisingly, very few models study representation learning for authors. These representations can be used for many NLP tasks, such as author identification and classification, or in recommendation systems. A strong limitation of existing works is that they do not explicitly capture writing style, making them hardly applicable to literary data. We therefore propose a new architecture based on Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) that learns embeddings for both authors and documents with a stylistic constraint. Our model fine-tunes a pre-trained document encoder. We stimulate the detection of writing style by adding predefined stylistic features making the representation axis interpretable with respect to writing style indicators. We evaluate our method on three datasets: a literary corpus extracted from the Gutenberg Project, the Blog Authorship Corpus and IMDb62, for which we show that it matches or outperforms strong/recent baselines in authorship attribution while capturing much more accurately the authors stylistic aspects.</description>

      <title>Linear-Complexity Self-Supervised Learning for Speech Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models usually require weeks of pre-training with dozens of high-end GPUs. These models typically have a multi-headed self-attention (MHSA) context encoder. However, MHSA takes quadratic time and space in the input length, contributing to the high pre-training cost. Linear-complexity alternatives to MHSA have been proposed. For instance, in supervised training, the SummaryMixing model is the first to outperform MHSA across multiple speech processing tasks. However, these cheaper alternatives have not been explored for SSL yet. This paper studies a linear-complexity context encoder for SSL for the first time. With better or equivalent performance for the downstream tasks of the MP3S benchmark, SummaryMixing reduces the pre-training time and peak VRAM of wav2vec 2.0 model by 18% and by 23%, respectively, leading to the pre-training of a 155M wav2vec 2.0 model finished within one week with 4 Tesla A100 GPUs. Code is available at https://github.com/SamsungLabs/SummaryMixing.</description>

      <title>From Words to Worlds: Compositionality for Cognitive Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are very performant connectionist systems, but do they exhibit more compositionality? More importantly, is that part of why they perform so well? We present empirical analyses across four LLM families (12 models) and three task categories, including a novel task introduced below. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship in learning of compositional strategies by LLMs -- while scaling enhances compositional abilities, instruction tuning often has a reverse effect. Such disparity brings forth some open issues regarding the development and improvement of large language models in alignment with human cognitive capacities.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Out-of-Vocabulary Performance of Indian TTS Systems for Practical Applications through Low-Effort Data Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Publicly available TTS datasets for low-resource languages like Hindi and Tamil typically contain 10-20 hours of data, leading to poor vocabulary coverage. This limitation becomes evident in downstream applications where domain-specific vocabulary coupled with frequent code-mixing with English, results in many OOV words. To highlight this problem, we create a benchmark containing OOV words from several real-world applications. Indeed, state-of-the-art Hindi and Tamil TTS systems perform poorly on this OOV benchmark, as indicated by intelligibility tests. To improve the model's OOV performance, we propose a low-effort and economically viable strategy to obtain more training data. Specifically, we propose using volunteers as opposed to high quality voice artists to record words containing character bigrams unseen in the training data. We show that using such inexpensive data, the model's performance improves on OOV words, while not affecting voice quality and in-domain performance.</description>

      <title>End-To-End Clinical Trial Matching with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matching cancer patients to clinical trials is essential for advancing treatment and patient care. However, the inconsistent format of medical free text documents and complex trial eligibility criteria make this process extremely challenging and time-consuming for physicians. We investigated whether the entire trial matching process - from identifying relevant trials among 105,600 oncology-related clinical trials on clinicaltrials.gov to generating criterion-level eligibility matches - could be automated using Large Language Models (LLMs). Using GPT-4o and a set of 51 synthetic Electronic Health Records (EHRs), we demonstrate that our approach identifies relevant candidate trials in 93.3% of cases and achieves a preliminary accuracy of 88.0% when matching patient-level information at the criterion level against a baseline defined by human experts. Utilizing LLM feedback reveals that 39.3% criteria that were initially considered incorrect are either ambiguous or inaccurately annotated, leading to a total model accuracy of 92.7% after refining our human baseline. In summary, we present an end-to-end pipeline for clinical trial matching using LLMs, demonstrating high precision in screening and matching trials to individual patients, even outperforming the performance of qualified medical doctors. Our fully end-to-end pipeline can operate autonomously or with human supervision and is not restricted to oncology, offering a scalable solution for enhancing patient-trial matching in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Fixed and Adaptive Simultaneous Machine Translation Strategies Using Adapters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous machine translation aims at solving the task of real-time translation by starting to translate before consuming the full input, which poses challenges in terms of balancing quality and latency of the translation. The wait-$k$ policy offers a solution by starting to translate after consuming $k$ words, where the choice of the number $k$ directly affects the latency and quality. In applications where we seek to keep the choice over latency and quality at inference, the wait-$k$ policy obliges us to train more than one model. In this paper, we address the challenge of building one model that can fulfil multiple latency levels and we achieve this by introducing lightweight adapter modules into the decoder. The adapters are trained to be specialized for different wait-$k$ values and compared to other techniques they offer more flexibility to allow for reaping the benefits of parameter sharing and minimizing interference. Additionally, we show that by combining with an adaptive strategy, we can further improve the results. Experiments on two language directions show that our method outperforms or competes with other strong baselines on most latency values.</description>

      <title>Attention Overflow: Language Model Input Blur during Long-Context Missing Items Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can suggest missing elements from items listed in a prompt, which can be used for list completion or recommendations based on users' history. However, their performance degrades when presented with too many items, as they start to suggest items already included in the input list. This occurs at around 100 items for mid-2024 flagship LLMs. We evaluate this phenomenon on both synthetic problems (e.g., finding missing numbers in a given range of shuffled integers) and realistic movie recommendation scenarios. We refer to this issue as \textit{attention overflow}, as preventing repetition requires attending to all items simultaneously. Although iterative loops can mitigate this problem, their costs increase with the repetition rate, affecting the language models' ability to derive novelty from lengthy inputs.</description>

      <title>Combining Constraint Programming Reasoning with Large Language Model Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraint Programming (CP) and Machine Learning (ML) face challenges in text generation due to CP's struggle with implementing "meaning'' and ML's difficulty with structural constraints. This paper proposes a solution by combining both approaches and embedding a Large Language Model (LLM) in CP. The LLM handles word generation and meaning, while CP manages structural constraints. This approach builds on GenCP, an improved version of On-the-fly Constraint Programming Search (OTFS) using LLM-generated domains. Compared to Beam Search (BS), a standard NLP method, this combined approach (GenCP with LLM) is faster and produces better results, ensuring all constraints are satisfied. This fusion of CP and ML presents new possibilities for enhancing text generation under constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-growing volume of biomedical publications creates a critical need for efficient knowledge discovery. In this context, we introduce an open-source end-to-end framework designed to construct knowledge around specific diseases directly from raw text. To facilitate research in disease-related knowledge discovery, we create two annotated datasets focused on Rett syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, enabling the identification of semantic relations between biomedical entities. Extensive benchmarking explores various ways to represent relations and entity representations, offering insights into optimal modeling strategies for semantic relation detection and highlighting language models' competence in knowledge discovery. We also conduct probing experiments using different layer representations and attention scores to explore transformers' ability to capture semantic relations.</description>

      <title>Can Open-Source LLMs Compete with Commercial Models? Exploring the Few-Shot Performance of Current GPT Models in Biomedical Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commercial large language models (LLMs), like OpenAI's GPT-4 powering ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus, have dominated natural language processing (NLP) benchmarks across different domains. New competing Open-Source alternatives like Mixtral 8x7B or Llama 3 have emerged and seem to be closing the gap while often offering higher throughput and being less costly to use. Open-Source LLMs can also be self-hosted, which makes them interesting for enterprise and clinical use cases where sensitive data should not be processed by third parties. We participated in the 12th BioASQ challenge, which is a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) setting, and explored the performance of current GPT models Claude 3 Opus, GPT-3.5-turbo and Mixtral 8x7b with in-context learning (zero-shot, few-shot) and QLoRa fine-tuning. We also explored how additional relevant knowledge from Wikipedia added to the context-window of the LLM might improve their performance. Mixtral 8x7b was competitive in the 10-shot setting, both with and without fine-tuning, but failed to produce usable results in the zero-shot setting. QLoRa fine-tuning and Wikipedia context did not lead to measurable performance gains. Our results indicate that the performance gap between commercial and open-source models in RAG setups exists mainly in the zero-shot setting and can be closed by simply collecting few-shot examples for domain-specific use cases. The code needed to rerun these experiments is available through GitHub.</description>

      <title>Research on Tibetan Tourism Viewpoints information generation system based on LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tibet, ensconced within China's territorial expanse, is distinguished by its labyrinthine and heterogeneous topography, a testament to its profound historical heritage, and the cradle of a unique religious ethos. The very essence of these attributes, however, has impeded the advancement of Tibet's tourism service infrastructure, rendering existing smart tourism services inadequate for the region's visitors. This study delves into the ramifications of informational disparities at tourist sites on Tibetan tourism and addresses the challenge of establishing the Large Language Model (LLM) evaluation criteria. It introduces an innovative approach, the DualGen Bridge AI system, employing supervised fine-tuning techniques to bolster model functionality and enhance optimization processes. Furthermore, it pioneers a multi-structured generative results assessment framework. Empirical validation confirms the efficacy of this framework. The study also explores the application of the supervised fine-tuning method within the proprietary DualGen Bridge AI, aimed at refining the generation of tourist site information. The study's findings offer valuable insights for optimizing system performance and provide support and inspiration for the application of LLM technology in Tibet's tourism services and beyond, potentially revolutionizing the smart tourism industry with advanced, tailored information generation capabilities.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Reliable Knowledge Bases?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NLP community has recently shown a growing interest in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for knowledge-intensive tasks, viewing LLMs as potential knowledge bases (KBs). However, the reliability and extent to which LLMs can function as KBs remain underexplored. While previous studies suggest LLMs can encode knowledge within their parameters, the amount of parametric knowledge alone is not sufficient to evaluate their effectiveness as KBs. This study defines criteria that a reliable LLM-as-KB should meet, focusing on factuality and consistency, and covering both seen and unseen knowledge. We develop several metrics based on these criteria and use them to evaluate 26 popular LLMs, while providing a comprehensive analysis of the effects of model size, instruction tuning, and in-context learning (ICL). Our results paint a worrying picture. Even a high-performant model like GPT-3.5-turbo is not factual or consistent, and strategies like ICL and fine-tuning are unsuccessful at making LLMs better KBs.</description>

      <title>Towards Zero-Shot Multimodal Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current multimodal machine translation (MMT) systems rely on fully supervised data (i.e models are trained on sentences with their translations and accompanying images). However, this type of data is costly to collect, limiting the extension of MMT to other language pairs for which such data does not exist. In this work, we propose a method to bypass the need for fully supervised data to train MMT systems, using multimodal English data only. Our method, called ZeroMMT, consists in adapting a strong text-only machine translation (MT) model by training it on a mixture of two objectives: visually conditioned masked language modelling and the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the original and new MMT outputs. We evaluate on standard MMT benchmarks and the recently released CoMMuTE, a contrastive benchmark aiming to evaluate how well models use images to disambiguate English sentences. We obtain disambiguation performance close to state-of-the-art MMT models trained additionally on fully supervised examples. To prove that our method generalizes to languages with no fully supervised training data available, we extend the CoMMuTE evaluation dataset to three new languages: Arabic, Russian and Chinese. We further show that we can control the trade-off between disambiguation capabilities and translation fidelity at inference time using classifier-free guidance and without any additional data. Our code, data and trained models are publicly accessible.</description>

      <title>PLANTS: A Novel Problem and Dataset for Summarization of Planning-Like (PL) Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text summarization is a well-studied problem that deals with deriving insights from unstructured text consumed by humans, and it has found extensive business applications. However, many real-life tasks involve generating a series of actions to achieve specific goals, such as workflows, recipes, dialogs, and travel plans. We refer to them as planning-like (PL) tasks noting that the main commonality they share is control flow information. which may be partially specified. Their structure presents an opportunity to create more practical summaries to help users make quick decisions. We investigate this observation by introducing a novel plan summarization problem, presenting a dataset, and providing a baseline method for generating PL summaries. Using quantitative metrics and qualitative user studies to establish baselines, we evaluate the plan summaries from our method and large language models. We believe the novel problem and dataset can reinvigorate research in summarization, which some consider as a solved problem.</description>

      <title>dzStance at StanceEval2024: Arabic Stance Detection based on Sentence Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study compares Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) features with Sentence Transformers for detecting writers' stances--favorable, opposing, or neutral--towards three significant topics: COVID-19 vaccine, digital transformation, and women empowerment. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that Sentence Transformers outperform TF-IDF features across various experimental setups. Our team, dzStance, participated in a stance detection competition, achieving the 13th position (74.91%) among 15 teams in Women Empowerment, 10th (73.43%) in COVID Vaccine, and 12th (66.97%) in Digital Transformation. Overall, our team's performance ranked 13th (71.77%) among all participants. Notably, our approach achieved promising F1-scores, highlighting its effectiveness in identifying writers' stances on diverse topics. These results underscore the potential of Sentence Transformers to enhance stance detection models for addressing critical societal issues.</description>

      <title>dzNLP at NADI 2024 Shared Task: Multi-Classifier Ensemble with Weighted Voting and TF-IDF Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the contribution of our dzNLP team to the NADI 2024 shared task, specifically in Subtask 1 - Multi-label Country-level Dialect Identification (MLDID) (Closed Track). We explored various configurations to address the challenge: in Experiment 1, we utilized a union of n-gram analyzers (word, character, character with word boundaries) with different n-gram values; in Experiment 2, we combined a weighted union of Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) features with various weights; and in Experiment 3, we implemented a weighted major voting scheme using three classifiers: Linear Support Vector Classifier (LSVC), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
  Our approach, despite its simplicity and reliance on traditional machine learning techniques, demonstrated competitive performance in terms of F1-score and precision. Notably, we achieved the highest precision score of 63.22% among the participating teams. However, our overall F1 score was approximately 21%, significantly impacted by a low recall rate of 12.87%. This indicates that while our models were highly precise, they struggled to recall a broad range of dialect labels, highlighting a critical area for improvement in handling diverse dialectal variations.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws with Vocabulary: Larger Models Deserve Larger Vocabularies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on scaling large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused on model parameters and training data size, overlooking the role of vocabulary size. % Intuitively, larger vocabularies enable more efficient tokenization by representing sentences with fewer tokens, but they also increase the risk of under-fitting representations for rare tokens. We investigate how vocabulary size impacts LLM scaling laws by training models ranging from 33M to 3B parameters on up to 500B characters with various vocabulary configurations. We propose three complementary approaches for predicting the compute-optimal vocabulary size: IsoFLOPs analysis, derivative estimation, and parametric fit of the loss function. Our approaches converge on the same result that the optimal vocabulary size depends on the available compute budget and that larger models deserve larger vocabularies. However, most LLMs use too small vocabulary sizes. For example, we predict that the optimal vocabulary size of Llama2-70B should have been at least 216K, 7 times larger than its vocabulary of 32K. We validate our predictions empirically by training models with 3B parameters across different FLOPs budgets. Adopting our predicted optimal vocabulary size consistently improves downstream performance over commonly used vocabulary sizes. By increasing the vocabulary size from the conventional 32K to 43K, we improve performance on ARC-Challenge from 29.1 to 32.0 with the same 2.3e21 FLOPs. Our work emphasizes the necessity of jointly considering model parameters and vocabulary size for efficient scaling.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study on Automatic Coding of Medical Letters with Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to explore the implementation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to automate the coding of medical letters with visualised explainability and light-weighted local computer settings. Currently in clinical settings, coding is a manual process that involves assigning codes to each condition, procedure, and medication in a patient's paperwork (e.g., 56265001 heart disease using SNOMED CT code). There are preliminary research on automatic coding in this field using state-of-the-art ML models; however, due to the complexity and size of the models, the real-world deployment is not achieved. To further facilitate the possibility of automatic coding practice, we explore some solutions in a local computer setting; in addition, we explore the function of explainability for transparency of AI models. We used the publicly available MIMIC-III database and the HAN/HLAN network models for ICD code prediction purposes. We also experimented with the mapping between ICD and SNOMED CT knowledge bases. In our experiments, the models provided useful information for 97.98\% of codes. The result of this investigation can shed some light on implementing automatic clinical coding in practice, such as in hospital settings, on the local computers used by clinicians , project page \url{https://github.com/Glenj01/Medical-Coding}.</description>

      <title>Weak-to-Strong Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When large language models (LLMs) exceed human-level capabilities, it becomes increasingly challenging to provide full-scale and accurate supervisions for these models. Weak-to-strong learning, which leverages a less capable model to unlock the latent abilities of a stronger model, proves valuable in this context. Yet, the efficacy of this approach for complex reasoning tasks is still untested. Furthermore, tackling reasoning tasks under the weak-to-strong setting currently lacks efficient methods to avoid blindly imitating the weak supervisor including its errors. In this paper, we introduce a progressive learning framework that enables the strong model to autonomously refine its training data, without requiring input from either a more advanced model or human-annotated data. This framework begins with supervised fine-tuning on a selective small but high-quality dataset, followed by preference optimization on contrastive samples identified by the strong model itself. Extensive experiments on the GSM8K and MATH datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of Llama2-70b using three separate weak models. This method is further validated in a forward-looking experimental setup, where Llama3-8b-instruct effectively supervises Llama3-70b on the highly challenging OlympicArena dataset. This work paves the way for a more scalable and sophisticated strategy to enhance AI reasoning powers. All relevant code and resources are available in \url{https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/weak-to-strong-reasoning}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research in the field of language models is rapidly evolving, with many open models being released to the public. Openly available pretraining corpora usually focus on only a handful of languages, with many others either missing completely or extremely underrepresented. In this report, we introduce FuLG, a hundred-fifty-billion-token Romanian corpus extracted from CommonCrawl. We present our methodology for filtering FuLG and compare it via ablation studies against existing Romanian corpora.</description>

      <title>DART-Math: Difficulty-Aware Rejection Tuning for Mathematical Problem-Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving mathematical problems requires advanced reasoning abilities and presents notable challenges for large language models. Previous works usually synthesize data from proprietary models to augment existing datasets, followed by instruction tuning to achieve top-tier results. However, our analysis of these datasets reveals severe biases towards easy queries, with frequent failures to generate any correct response for the most challenging queries. Hypothesizing that difficult queries are crucial to learn complex reasoning, we propose Difficulty-Aware Rejection Tuning (DART), a method that allocates difficult queries more trials during the synthesis phase, enabling more extensive training on difficult samples. Utilizing DART, we have created new datasets for mathematical problem-solving that focus more on difficult queries and are substantially smaller than previous ones. Remarkably, our synthesis process solely relies on a 7B-sized open-weight model, without reliance on the commonly used proprietary GPT-4. We fine-tune various base models on our datasets ranging from 7B to 70B in size, resulting in a series of strong models called DART-MATH. In comprehensive in-domain and out-of-domain evaluation on 6 mathematical benchmarks, DART-MATH outperforms vanilla rejection tuning significantly, being superior or comparable to previous arts, despite using much smaller datasets and no proprietary models. Furthermore, our results position our synthetic datasets as the most effective and cost-efficient publicly available resources for advancing mathematical problem-solving.</description>

      <title>Prover-Verifier Games improve legibility of LLM outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One way to increase confidence in the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs) is to support them with reasoning that is clear and easy to check -- a property we call legibility. We study legibility in the context of solving grade-school math problems and show that optimizing chain-of-thought solutions only for answer correctness can make them less legible. To mitigate the loss in legibility, we propose a training algorithm inspired by Prover-Verifier Game from Anil et al. (2021). Our algorithm iteratively trains small verifiers to predict solution correctness, "helpful" provers to produce correct solutions that the verifier accepts, and "sneaky" provers to produce incorrect solutions that fool the verifier. We find that the helpful prover's accuracy and the verifier's robustness to adversarial attacks increase over the course of training. Furthermore, we show that legibility training transfers to time-constrained humans tasked with verifying solution correctness. Over course of LLM training human accuracy increases when checking the helpful prover's solutions, and decreases when checking the sneaky prover's solutions. Hence, training for checkability by small verifiers is a plausible technique for increasing output legibility. Our results suggest legibility training against small verifiers as a practical avenue for increasing legibility of large LLMs to humans, and thus could help with alignment of superhuman models.</description>

      <title>Benchmark Agreement Testing Done Right: A Guide for LLM Benchmark Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Language Models (LMs) have catalyzed the creation of multiple benchmarks, designed to assess these models' general capabilities. A crucial task, however, is assessing the validity of the benchmarks themselves. This is most commonly done via Benchmark Agreement Testing (BAT), where new benchmarks are validated against established ones using some agreement metric (e.g., rank correlation). Despite the crucial role of BAT for benchmark builders and consumers, there are no standardized procedures for such agreement testing. This deficiency can lead to invalid conclusions, fostering mistrust in benchmarks and upending the ability to properly choose the appropriate benchmark to use. By analyzing over 40 prominent benchmarks, we demonstrate how some overlooked methodological choices can significantly influence BAT results, potentially undermining the validity of conclusions. To address these inconsistencies, we propose a set of best practices for BAT and demonstrate how utilizing these methodologies greatly improves BAT robustness and validity. To foster adoption and facilitate future research,, we introduce BenchBench, a python package for BAT, and release the BenchBench-leaderboard, a meta-benchmark designed to evaluate benchmarks using their peers. Our findings underscore the necessity for standardized BAT, ensuring the robustness and validity of benchmark evaluations in the evolving landscape of language model research.

      <title>ANHALTEN: Cross-Lingual Transfer for German Token-Level Reference-Free Hallucination Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on token-level reference-free hallucination detection has predominantly focused on English, primarily due to the scarcity of robust datasets in other languages. This has hindered systematic investigations into the effectiveness of cross-lingual transfer for this important NLP application. To address this gap, we introduce ANHALTEN, a new evaluation dataset that extends the English hallucination detection dataset to German. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores cross-lingual transfer for token-level reference-free hallucination detection. ANHALTEN contains gold annotations in German that are parallel (i.e., directly comparable to the original English instances). We benchmark several prominent cross-lingual transfer approaches, demonstrating that larger context length leads to better hallucination detection in German, even without succeeding context. Importantly, we show that the sample-efficient few-shot transfer is the most effective approach in most setups. This highlights the practical benefits of minimal annotation effort in the target language for reference-free hallucination detection. Aiming to catalyze future research on cross-lingual token-level reference-free hallucination detection, we make ANHALTEN publicly available: https://github.com/janekh24/anhalten</description>

      <title>Understanding Reference Policies in Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a widely used training method for the instruction fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we explore an under-investigated aspect of DPO - its dependency on the reference model or policy. Such reference policies, typically instantiated as the model to be further fine-tuned, are important since they can impose an upper limit on DPO's effectiveness. Therefore, we address three related research questions in this work. First, we explore the optimal strength of the KL-divergence constraint in DPO, which penalizes deviations from the reference policy, and find that DPO is sensitive to this strength. Next, we examine the necessity of reference policies for instruction fine-tuning by providing both theoretical and empirical comparisons between DPO and related learning objectives, demonstrating DPO's superiority. Additionally, we investigate whether DPO benefits from stronger reference policies, finding that a stronger reference policy can lead to improved performance, but only when it is similar to the model being fine-tuned. Our findings highlight the confounding role of reference policies in DPO and offer insights for best practices, while also identifying open research questions for future studies.</description>

Abstract: Humans solve problems by following existing rules and procedures, and also by leaps of creativity to redefine those rules and objectives. To probe these abilities, we developed a new benchmark based on the game Baba Is You where an agent manipulates both objects in the environment and rules, represented by movable tiles with words written on them, to reach a specified goal and win the game. We test three state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models (OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini-1.5-Pro and Gemini-1.5-Flash) and find that they fail dramatically when generalization requires that the rules of the game must be manipulated and combined.</description>

      <title>LLMs as Function Approximators: Terminology, Taxonomy, and Questions for Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural Language Processing has moved rather quickly from modelling specific tasks to taking more general pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for specific tasks, to a point where we now have what appear to be inherently generalist models. This paper argues that the resultant loss of clarity on what these models model leads to metaphors like "artificial general intelligences" that are not helpful for evaluating their strengths and weaknesses. The proposal is to see their generality, and their potential value, in their ability to approximate specialist function, based on a natural language specification. This framing brings to the fore questions of the quality of the approximation, but beyond that, also questions of discoverability, stability, and protectability of these functions. As the paper will show, this framing hence brings together in one conceptual framework various aspects of evaluation, both from a practical and a theoretical perspective, as well as questions often relegated to a secondary status (such as "prompt injection" and "jailbreaking").</description>

      <title>Black-Box Opinion Manipulation Attacks to Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is applied to solve hallucination problems and real-time constraints of large language models, but it also induces vulnerabilities against retrieval corruption attacks. Existing research mainly explores the unreliability of RAG in white-box and closed-domain QA tasks. In this paper, we aim to reveal the vulnerabilities of Retrieval-Enhanced Generative (RAG) models when faced with black-box attacks for opinion manipulation. We explore the impact of such attacks on user cognition and decision-making, providing new insight to enhance the reliability and security of RAG models. We manipulate the ranking results of the retrieval model in RAG with instruction and use these results as data to train a surrogate model. By employing adversarial retrieval attack methods to the surrogate model, black-box transfer attacks on RAG are further realized. Experiments conducted on opinion datasets across multiple topics show that the proposed attack strategy can significantly alter the opinion polarity of the content generated by RAG. This demonstrates the model's vulnerability and, more importantly, reveals the potential negative impact on user cognition and decision-making, making it easier to mislead users into accepting incorrect or biased information.</description>

      <title>Latent Causal Probing: A Formal Perspective on Probing with Causal Models of Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As language models (LMs) deliver increasing performance on a range of NLP tasks, probing classifiers have become an indispensable technique in the effort to better understand their inner workings. A typical setup involves (1) defining an auxiliary task consisting of a dataset of text annotated with labels, then (2) supervising small classifiers to predict the labels from the representations of a pretrained LM as it processed the dataset. A high probing accuracy is interpreted as evidence that the LM has learned to perform the auxiliary task as an unsupervised byproduct of its original pretraining objective. Despite the widespread usage of probes, however, the robust design and analysis of probing experiments remains a challenge. We develop a formal perspective on probing using structural causal models (SCM). Specifically, given an SCM which explains the distribution of tokens observed during training, we frame the central hypothesis as whether the LM has learned to represent the latent variables of the SCM. Empirically, we extend a recent study of LMs in the context of a synthetic grid-world navigation task, where having an exact model of the underlying causal structure allows us to draw strong inferences from the result of probing experiments. Our techniques provide robust empirical evidence for the ability of LMs to learn the latent causal concepts underlying text.</description>

      <title>Spectra: A Comprehensive Study of Ternary, Quantized, and FP16 Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-training quantization is the leading method for addressing memory-related bottlenecks in LLM inference, but unfortunately, it suffers from significant performance degradation below 4-bit precision. An alternative approach involves training compressed models directly at a low bitwidth (e.g., binary or ternary models). However, the performance, training dynamics, and scaling trends of such models are not yet well understood. To address this issue, we train and openly release the Spectra LLM suite consisting of 54 language models ranging from 99M to 3.9B parameters, trained on 300B tokens. Spectra includes FloatLMs, post-training quantized QuantLMs (3, 4, 6, and 8 bits), and ternary LLMs (TriLMs) - our improved architecture for ternary language modeling, which significantly outperforms previously proposed ternary models of a given size (in bits), matching half-precision models at scale. For example, TriLM 3.9B is (bit-wise) smaller than the half-precision FloatLM 830M, but matches half-precision FloatLM 3.9B in commonsense reasoning and knowledge benchmarks. However, TriLM 3.9B is also as toxic and stereotyping as FloatLM 3.9B, a model six times larger in size. Additionally, TriLM 3.9B lags behind FloatLM in perplexity on validation splits and web-based corpora but performs better on less noisy datasets like Lambada and PennTreeBank.
  To enhance understanding of low-bitwidth models, we are releasing 500+ intermediate checkpoints of the Spectra suite at \href{https://github.com/NolanoOrg/SpectraSuite}{https://github.com/NolanoOrg/SpectraSuite}.</description>

      <title>A Look Into Training Large Language Models on Next Generation Datacenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Is it still worth doing computer networking research? What are relevant problems in this space given the supremacy of hyperscalers in deployed large networks? We take an unconventional approach to finding relevant research directions, by starting from Microsoft's plans to build a $100 billion datacenter for ML. Our goal is to understand what models could be trained in such a datacenter, as well as the high-level challenges one may encounter in doing so.
  We first examine the constraints imposed by cooling and power requirements for our target datacenter and find that it is infeasible to build in a single location. We use LLM scaling laws to determine that we could train models of 50T or 100T. Finally, we examine how distributed training might work for these models, and what the networking requirements are. We conclude that building the datacenter and training such models is technically possible, but this requires a novel NIC-based multipath transport along with a redesign of the entire training stack, outlining a research agenda for our community in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel two-stage Retrieve-Rank system for automated ICD-10-CM medical coding, comparing its performance against a Vanilla Large Language Model (LLM) approach. Evaluating both systems on a dataset of 100 single-term medical conditions, the Retrieve-Rank system achieved 100% accuracy in predicting correct ICD-10-CM codes, significantly outperforming the Vanilla LLM (GPT-3.5-turbo), which achieved only 6% accuracy. Our analysis demonstrates the Retrieve-Rank system's superior precision in handling various medical terms across different specialties. While these results are promising, we acknowledge the limitations of using simplified inputs and the need for further testing on more complex, realistic medical cases. This research contributes to the ongoing effort to improve the efficiency and accuracy of medical coding, highlighting the importance of retrieval-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Use of Abusive Generative AI Models on Civitai</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of generative AI is transforming the landscape of digital imagery, and exerting a significant influence on online creative communities. This has led to the emergence of AI-Generated Content (AIGC) social platforms, such as Civitai. These distinctive social platforms allow users to build and share their own generative AI models, thereby enhancing the potential for more diverse artistic expression. Designed in the vein of social networks, they also provide artists with the means to showcase their creations (generated from the models), engage in discussions, and obtain feedback, thus nurturing a sense of community. Yet, this openness also raises concerns about the abuse of such platforms, e.g., using models to disseminate deceptive deepfakes or infringe upon copyrights. To explore this, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study of an AIGC social platform, focusing on its use for generating abusive content. As an exemplar, we construct a comprehensive dataset covering Civitai, the largest available AIGC social platform. Based on this dataset of 87K models and 2M images, we explore the characteristics of content and discuss strategies for moderation to better govern these platforms.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Augmentation for Few-Shot Multimodal Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nascent topic of fake news requires automatic detection methods to quickly learn from limited annotated samples. Therefore, the capacity to rapidly acquire proficiency in a new task with limited guidance, also known as few-shot learning, is critical for detecting fake news in its early stages. Existing approaches either involve fine-tuning pre-trained language models which come with a large number of parameters, or training a complex neural network from scratch with large-scale annotated datasets. This paper presents a multimodal fake news detection model which augments multimodal features using unimodal features. For this purpose, we introduce Cross-Modal Augmentation (CMA), a simple approach for enhancing few-shot multimodal fake news detection by transforming n-shot classification into a more robust (n $\times$ z)-shot problem, where z represents the number of supplementary features. The proposed CMA achieves SOTA results over three benchmark datasets, utilizing a surprisingly simple linear probing method to classify multimodal fake news with only a few training samples. Furthermore, our method is significantly more lightweight than prior approaches, particularly in terms of the number of trainable parameters and epoch times.

      <title>Retrieval-Enhanced Machine Learning: Synthesis and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of language modeling, models augmented with retrieval components have emerged as a promising solution to address several challenges faced in the natural language processing (NLP) field, including knowledge grounding, interpretability, and scalability. Despite the primary focus on NLP, we posit that the paradigm of retrieval-enhancement can be extended to a broader spectrum of machine learning (ML) such as computer vision, time series prediction, and computational biology. Therefore, this work introduces a formal framework of this paradigm, Retrieval-Enhanced Machine Learning (REML), by synthesizing the literature in various domains in ML with consistent notations which is missing from the current literature. Also, we found that while a number of studies employ retrieval components to augment their models, there is a lack of integration with foundational Information Retrieval (IR) research. We bridge this gap between the seminal IR research and contemporary REML studies by investigating each component that comprises the REML framework. Ultimately, the goal of this work is to equip researchers across various disciplines with a comprehensive, formally structured framework of retrieval-enhanced models, thereby fostering interdisciplinary future research.</description>

      <title>Pre-Trained Foundation Model representations to uncover Breathing patterns in Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process of human speech production involves coordinated respiratory action to elicit acoustic speech signals. Typically, speech is produced when air is forced from the lungs and is modulated by the vocal tract, where such actions are interspersed by moments of breathing in air (inhalation) to refill the lungs again. Respiratory rate (RR) is a vital metric that is used to assess the overall health, fitness, and general well-being of an individual. Existing approaches to measure RR (number of breaths one takes in a minute) are performed using specialized equipment or training. Studies have demonstrated that machine learning algorithms can be used to estimate RR using bio-sensor signals as input. Speech-based estimation of RR can offer an effective approach to measure the vital metric without requiring any specialized equipment or sensors. This work investigates a machine learning based approach to estimate RR from speech segments obtained from subjects speaking to a close-talking microphone device. Data were collected from N=26 individuals, where the groundtruth RR was obtained through commercial grade chest-belts and then manually corrected for any errors. A convolutional long-short term memory network (Conv-LSTM) is proposed to estimate respiration time-series data from the speech signal. We demonstrate that the use of pre-trained representations obtained from a foundation model, such as Wav2Vec2, can be used to estimate respiration-time-series with low root-mean-squared error and high correlation coefficient, when compared with the baseline. The model-driven time series can be used to estimate $RR$ with a low mean absolute error (MAE) ~ 1.6 breaths/min.</description>

      <title>E2Vec: Feature Embedding with Temporal Information for Analyzing Student Actions in E-Book Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital textbook (e-book) systems record student interactions with textbooks as a sequence of events called EventStream data. In the past, researchers extracted meaningful features from EventStream, and utilized them as inputs for downstream tasks such as grade prediction and modeling of student behavior. Previous research evaluated models that mainly used statistical-based features derived from EventStream logs, such as the number of operation types or access frequencies. While these features are useful for providing certain insights, they lack temporal information that captures fine-grained differences in learning behaviors among different students. This study proposes E2Vec, a novel feature representation method based on word embeddings. The proposed method regards operation logs and their time intervals for each student as a string sequence of characters and generates a student vector of learning activity features that incorporates time information. We applied fastText to generate an embedding vector for each of 305 students in a dataset from two years of computer science courses. Then, we investigated the effectiveness of E2Vec in an at-risk detection task, demonstrating potential for generalizability and performance.</description>

      <title>Analysing the Public Discourse around OpenAI's Text-To-Video Model 'Sora' using Topic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent introduction of OpenAI's text-to-video model Sora has sparked widespread public discourse across online communities. This study aims to uncover the dominant themes and narratives surrounding Sora by conducting topic modeling analysis on a corpus of 1,827 Reddit comments from five relevant subreddits (r/OpenAI, r/technology, r/singularity, r/vfx, and r/ChatGPT). The comments were collected over a two-month period following Sora's announcement in February 2024. After preprocessing the data, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was employed to extract four key topics: 1) AI Impact and Trends in Sora Discussions, 2) Public Opinion and Concerns about Sora, 3) Artistic Expression and Video Creation with Sora, and 4) Sora's Applications in Media and Entertainment. Visualizations including word clouds, bar charts, and t-SNE clustering provided insights into the importance of topic keywords and the distribution of comments across topics. The results highlight prominent narratives around Sora's potential impact on industries and employment, public sentiment and ethical concerns, creative applications, and use cases in the media and entertainment sectors. While limited to Reddit data within a specific timeframe, this study offers a framework for understanding public perceptions of emerging generative AI technologies through online discourse analysis.</description>

      <title>MetaSumPerceiver: Multimodal Multi-Document Evidence Summarization for Fact-Checking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fact-checking real-world claims often requires reviewing multiple multimodal documents to assess a claim's truthfulness, which is a highly laborious and time-consuming task. In this paper, we present a summarization model designed to generate claim-specific summaries useful for fact-checking from multimodal, multi-document datasets. The model takes inputs in the form of documents, images, and a claim, with the objective of assisting in fact-checking tasks. We introduce a dynamic perceiver-based model that can handle inputs from multiple modalities of arbitrary lengths. To train our model, we leverage a novel reinforcement learning-based entailment objective to generate summaries that provide evidence distinguishing between different truthfulness labels. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we conduct experiments on both an existing benchmark and a new dataset of multi-document claims that we contribute. Our approach outperforms the SOTA approach by 4.6% in the claim verification task on the MOCHEG dataset and demonstrates strong performance on our new Multi-News-Fact-Checking dataset.</description>

      <title>TrialEnroll: Predicting Clinical Trial Enrollment Success with Deep &amp; Cross Network and Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical trials need to recruit a sufficient number of volunteer patients to demonstrate the statistical power of the treatment (e.g., a new drug) in curing a certain disease. Clinical trial recruitment has a significant impact on trial success. Forecasting whether the recruitment process would be successful before we run the trial would save many resources and time. This paper develops a novel deep &amp; cross network with large language model (LLM)-augmented text feature that learns semantic information from trial eligibility criteria and predicts enrollment success. The proposed method enables interpretability by understanding which sentence/word in eligibility criteria contributes heavily to prediction. We also demonstrate the empirical superiority of the proposed method (0.7002 PR-AUC) over a bunch of well-established machine learning methods. The code and curated dataset are publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TrialEnroll-7E12.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since language models (LMs) now outperform average humans on many challenging tasks, it has become increasingly difficult to develop challenging, high-quality, and realistic evaluations. We address this issue by examining LMs' capabilities to generate code for solving real scientific research problems. Incorporating input from scientists and AI researchers in 16 diverse natural science sub-fields, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science, we created a scientist-curated coding benchmark, SciCode. The problems in SciCode naturally factorize into multiple subproblems, each involving knowledge recall, reasoning, and code synthesis. In total, SciCode contains 338 subproblems decomposed from 80 challenging main problems. It offers optional descriptions specifying useful scientific background information and scientist-annotated gold-standard solutions and test cases for evaluation. Claude3.5-Sonnet, the best-performing model among those tested, can solve only 4.6% of the problems in the most realistic setting. We believe that SciCode demonstrates both contemporary LMs' progress towards becoming helpful scientific assistants and sheds light on the development and evaluation of scientific AI in the future.</description>

      <title>Low-Resourced Speech Recognition for Iu Mien Language via Weakly-Supervised Phoneme-based Multilingual Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mainstream automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology usually requires hundreds to thousands of hours of annotated speech data. Three approaches to low-resourced ASR are phoneme or subword based supervised pre-training, and self-supervised pre-training over multilingual data. The Iu Mien language is the main ethnic language of the Yao ethnic group in China and is low-resourced in the sense that the annotated speech is very limited. With less than 10 hours of transcribed Iu Mien language, this paper investigates and compares the three approaches for Iu Mien speech recognition. Our experiments are based on the recently released, three backbone models pretrained over the 10 languages from the CommonVoice dataset (CV-Lang10), which correspond to the three approaches for low-resourced ASR. It is found that phoneme supervision can achieve better results compared to subword supervision and self-supervision, thereby providing higher data-efficiency. Particularly, the Whistle models, i.e., obtained by the weakly-supervised phoneme-based multilingual pre-training, obtain the most competitive results.</description>

      <title>Correcting the Mythos of KL-Regularization: Direct Alignment without Overparameterization via Chi-squared Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language model alignment methods, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), have led to impressive advances in language model capabilities, but existing techniques are limited by a widely observed phenomenon known as overoptimization, where the quality of the language model plateaus or degrades over the course of the alignment process. Overoptimization is often attributed to overfitting to an inaccurate reward model, and while it can be mitigated through online data collection, this is infeasible in many settings. This raises a fundamental question: Do existing offline alignment algorithms make the most of the data they have, or can their sample-efficiency be improved further?
  We address this question with a new algorithm for offline alignment, $\chi^2$-Preference Optimization ($\chi$PO). $\chi$PO is a one-line change to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2023), which only involves modifying the logarithmic link function in the DPO objective. Despite this minimal change, $\chi$PO implicitly implements the principle of pessimism in the face of uncertainty via regularization with the $\chi^2$-divergence -- which quantifies uncertainty more effectively than KL-regularization -- and provably alleviates overoptimization, achieving sample-complexity guarantees based on single-policy concentrability -- the gold standard in offline reinforcement learning. $\chi$PO's simplicity and strong guarantees make it the first practical and general-purpose offline alignment algorithm that is provably robust to overoptimization.</description>

      <title>BEAF: Observing BEfore-AFter Changes to Evaluate Hallucination in Vision-language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) perceive the world through a combination of a visual encoder and a large language model (LLM). The visual encoder, pre-trained on large-scale vision-text datasets, provides zero-shot generalization to visual data, and the LLM endows its high reasoning ability to VLMs. It leads VLMs to achieve high performance on wide benchmarks without fine-tuning, exhibiting zero or few-shot capability. However, recent studies show that VLMs are vulnerable to hallucination. This undesirable behavior degrades reliability and credibility, thereby making users unable to fully trust the output from VLMs. To enhance trustworthiness and better tackle the hallucination of VLMs, we curate a new evaluation dataset, called the BEfore-AFter hallucination dataset (BEAF), and introduce new metrics: True Understanding (TU), IGnorance (IG), StuBbornness (SB), and InDecision (ID). Unlike prior works that focus only on constructing questions and answers, the key idea of our benchmark is to manipulate visual scene information by image editing models and to design the metrics based on scene changes. This allows us to clearly assess whether VLMs correctly understand a given scene by observing the ability to perceive changes. We also visualize image-wise object relationship by virtue of our two-axis view: vision and text. Upon evaluating VLMs with our dataset, we observed that our metrics reveal different aspects of VLM hallucination that have not been reported before.

      <title>Spontaneous Style Text-to-Speech Synthesis with Controllable Spontaneous Behaviors Based on Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous style speech synthesis, which aims to generate human-like speech, often encounters challenges due to the scarcity of high-quality data and limitations in model capabilities. Recent language model-based TTS systems can be trained on large, diverse, and low-quality speech datasets, resulting in highly natural synthesized speech. However, they are limited by the difficulty of simulating various spontaneous behaviors and capturing prosody variations in spontaneous speech. In this paper, we propose a novel spontaneous speech synthesis system based on language models. We systematically categorize and uniformly model diverse spontaneous behaviors. Moreover, fine-grained prosody modeling is introduced to enhance the model's ability to capture subtle prosody variations in spontaneous speech.Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline methods in terms of prosody naturalness and spontaneous behavior naturalness.</description>

      <title>Qalam : A Multimodal LLM for Arabic Optical Character and Handwriting Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arabic Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Handwriting Recognition (HWR) pose unique challenges due to the cursive and context-sensitive nature of the Arabic script. This study introduces Qalam, a novel foundation model designed for Arabic OCR and HWR, built on a SwinV2 encoder and RoBERTa decoder architecture. Our model significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a Word Error Rate (WER) of just 0.80% in HWR tasks and 1.18% in OCR tasks. We train Qalam on a diverse dataset, including over 4.5 million images from Arabic manuscripts and a synthetic dataset comprising 60k image-text pairs. Notably, Qalam demonstrates exceptional handling of Arabic diacritics, a critical feature in Arabic scripts. Furthermore, it shows a remarkable ability to process high-resolution inputs, addressing a common limitation in current OCR systems. These advancements underscore Qalam's potential as a leading solution for Arabic script recognition, offering a significant leap in accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>New Capability to Look Up an ASL Sign from a Video Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Looking up an unknown sign in an ASL dictionary can be difficult. Most ASL dictionaries are organized based on English glosses, despite the fact that (1) there is no convention for assigning English-based glosses to ASL signs; and (2) there is no 1-1 correspondence between ASL signs and English words. Furthermore, what if the user does not know either the meaning of the target sign or its possible English translation(s)? Some ASL dictionaries enable searching through specification of articulatory properties, such as handshapes, locations, movement properties, etc. However, this is a cumbersome process and does not always result in successful lookup. Here we describe a new system, publicly shared on the Web, to enable lookup of a video of an ASL sign (e.g., a webcam recording or a clip from a continuous signing video). The user submits a video for analysis and is presented with the five most likely sign matches, in decreasing order of likelihood, so that the user can confirm the selection and then be taken to our ASLLRP Sign Bank entry for that sign. Furthermore, this video lookup is also integrated into our newest version of SignStream(R) software to facilitate linguistic annotation of ASL video data, enabling the user to directly look up a sign in the video being annotated, and, upon confirmation of the match, to directly enter into the annotation the gloss and features of that sign, greatly increasing the efficiency and consistency of linguistic annotations of ASL video data.</description>

      <title>Scaling Granite Code Models to 128K Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces long-context Granite code models that support effective context windows of up to 128K tokens. Our solution for scaling context length of Granite 3B/8B code models from 2K/4K to 128K consists of a light-weight continual pretraining by gradually increasing its RoPE base frequency with repository-level file packing and length-upsampled long-context data. Additionally, we also release instruction-tuned models with long-context support which are derived by further finetuning the long context base models on a mix of permissively licensed short and long-context instruction-response pairs. While comparing to the original short-context Granite code models, our long-context models achieve significant improvements on long-context tasks without any noticeable performance degradation on regular code completion benchmarks (e.g., HumanEval). We release all our long-context Granite code models under an Apache 2.0 license for both research and commercial use.</description>

      <title>Language models show human-like content effects on reasoning tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.07051v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reasoning is a key ability for an intelligent system. Large language models (LMs) achieve above-chance performance on abstract reasoning tasks, but exhibit many imperfections. However, human abstract reasoning is also imperfect. For example, human reasoning is affected by our real-world knowledge and beliefs, and shows notable "content effects"; humans reason more reliably when the semantic content of a problem supports the correct logical inferences. These content-entangled reasoning patterns play a central role in debates about the fundamental nature of human intelligence. Here, we investigate whether language models $\unicode{x2014}$ whose prior expectations capture some aspects of human knowledge $\unicode{x2014}$ similarly mix content into their answers to logical problems. We explored this question across three logical reasoning tasks: natural language inference, judging the logical validity of syllogisms, and the Wason selection task. We evaluate state of the art large language models, as well as humans, and find that the language models reflect many of the same patterns observed in humans across these tasks $\unicode{x2014}$ like humans, models answer more accurately when the semantic content of a task supports the logical inferences. These parallels are reflected both in answer patterns, and in lower-level features like the relationship between model answer distributions and human response times. Our findings have implications for understanding both these cognitive effects in humans, and the factors that contribute to language model performance.</description>

      <title>Towards continually learning new languages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11703v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilingual speech recognition with neural networks is often implemented with batch-learning, when all of the languages are available before training. An ability to add new languages after the prior training sessions can be economically beneficial, but the main challenge is catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we combine the qualities of weight factorization and elastic weight consolidation in order to counter catastrophic forgetting and facilitate learning new languages quickly. Such combination allowed us to eliminate catastrophic forgetting while still achieving performance for the new languages comparable with having all languages at once, in experiments of learning from an initial 10 languages to achieve 26 languages without catastrophic forgetting and a reasonable performance compared to training all languages from scratch.</description>

      <title>On Learning to Summarize with Large Language Models as References</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have found that summaries generated by large language models (LLMs) are favored by human annotators over the original reference summaries in commonly used summarization datasets. Therefore, we study an LLM-as-reference learning setting for smaller text summarization models to investigate whether their performance can be substantially improved. To this end, we use LLMs as both oracle summary generators for standard supervised fine-tuning and oracle summary evaluators for efficient contrastive learning that leverages the LLMs' supervision signals. We conduct comprehensive experiments with source news articles and find that (1) summarization models trained under the LLM-as-reference setting achieve significant performance improvement in both LLM and human evaluations; (2) contrastive learning outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning under both low and high resource settings. Our experimental results also enable a meta-analysis of LLMs' summary evaluation capacities under a challenging setting, showing that LLMs are not well-aligned with human evaluators. Particularly, our expert human evaluation reveals remaining nuanced performance gaps between LLMs and our fine-tuned models, which LLMs fail to capture. Thus, we call for further studies into both the potential and challenges of using LLMs in summarization model development.</description>

      <title>AWQ: Activation-aware Weight Quantization for LLM Compression and Acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00978v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous AI applications. On-device LLM is becoming increasingly important: running LLMs locally on edge devices can reduce the cloud computing cost and protect users' privacy. However, the astronomical model size and the limited hardware resource pose significant deployment challenges. We propose Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ), a hardware-friendly approach for LLM low-bit weight-only quantization. AWQ finds that not all weights in an LLM are equally important. Protecting only 1% salient weights can greatly reduce quantization error. To identify salient weight channels, we should refer to the activation distribution, not weights. To avoid the hardware-inefficient mix-precision quantization, we mathematically derive that scaling up the salient channels can reduce the quantization error. AWQ employs an equivalent transformation to scale the salient weight channels to protect them. The scale is determined by collecting the activation statistics offline. AWQ does not rely on any backpropagation or reconstruction, so it generalizes to different domains and modalities without overfitting the calibration set. AWQ outperforms existing work on various language modeling and domain-specific benchmarks (coding and math). Thanks to better generalization, it achieves excellent quantization performance for instruction-tuned LMs and, for the first time, multi-modal LMs. Alongside AWQ, we implement TinyChat, an efficient and flexible inference framework tailored for 4-bit on-device LLM/VLMs. With kernel fusion and platform-aware weight packing, TinyChat offers more than 3x speedup over the Huggingface FP16 implementation on both desktop and mobile GPUs. It also democratizes the deployment of the 70B Llama-2 model on mobile GPUs.</description>

      <title>The Linear Representation Hypothesis and the Geometry of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Informally, the 'linear representation hypothesis' is the idea that high-level concepts are represented linearly as directions in some representation space. In this paper, we address two closely related questions: What does "linear representation" actually mean? And, how do we make sense of geometric notions (e.g., cosine similarity or projection) in the representation space? To answer these, we use the language of counterfactuals to give two formalizations of "linear representation", one in the output (word) representation space, and one in the input (sentence) space. We then prove these connect to linear probing and model steering, respectively. To make sense of geometric notions, we use the formalization to identify a particular (non-Euclidean) inner product that respects language structure in a sense we make precise. Using this causal inner product, we show how to unify all notions of linear representation. In particular, this allows the construction of probes and steering vectors using counterfactual pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of linear representations of concepts, the connection to interpretation and control, and the fundamental role of the choice of inner product.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Computation Efficiency in Large Language Models through Weight and Activation Quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are proficient in natural language processing tasks, but their deployment is often restricted by extensive parameter sizes and computational demands. This paper focuses on post-training quantization (PTQ) in LLMs, specifically 4-bit weight and 8-bit activation (W4A8) quantization, to enhance computational efficiency -- a topic less explored compared to weight-only quantization. We present two innovative techniques: activation-quantization-aware scaling (AQAS) and sequence-length-aware calibration (SLAC) to enhance PTQ by considering the combined effects on weights and activations and aligning calibration sequence lengths to target tasks. Moreover, we introduce dINT, a hybrid data format combining integer and denormal representations, to address the underflow issue in W4A8 quantization, where small values are rounded to zero. Through rigorous evaluations of LLMs, including OPT and LLaMA, we demonstrate that our techniques significantly boost task accuracies to levels comparable with full-precision models. By developing arithmetic units compatible with dINT, we further confirm that our methods yield a 2$\times$ hardware efficiency improvement compared to 8-bit integer MAC unit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To safeguard machine learning systems that operate on textual data against out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs that could cause unpredictable behaviour, we explore the use of topological features of self-attention maps from transformer-based language models to detect when input text is out of distribution. Self-attention forms the core of transformer-based language models, dynamically assigning vectors to words based on context, thus in theory our methodology is applicable to any transformer-based language model with multihead self-attention. We evaluate our approach on BERT and compare it to a traditional OOD approach using CLS embeddings. Our results show that our approach outperforms CLS embeddings in distinguishing in-distribution samples from far-out-of-domain samples, but struggles with near or same-domain datasets.</description>

      <title>Should we be going MAD? A Look at Multi-Agent Debate Strategies for LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore their potential for responding to inquiries in various domains. However, ensuring that generative agents provide accurate and reliable answers remains an ongoing challenge. In this context, multi-agent debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising strategy for enhancing the truthfulness of LLMs. We benchmark a range of debating and prompting strategies to explore the trade-offs between cost, time, and accuracy. Importantly, we find that multi-agent debating systems, in their current form, do not reliably outperform other proposed prompting strategies, such as self-consistency and ensembling using multiple reasoning paths. However, when performing hyperparameter tuning, several MAD systems, such as Multi-Persona, perform better. This suggests that MAD protocols might not be inherently worse than other approaches, but that they are more sensitive to different hyperparameter settings and difficult to optimize. We build on these results to offer insights into improving debating strategies, such as adjusting agent agreement levels, which can significantly enhance performance and even surpass all other non-debate protocols we evaluated. We provide an open-source repository to the community with several state-of-the-art protocols together with evaluation scripts to benchmark across popular research datasets.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains with extensive knowledge and creative capabilities. However, a critical issue with LLMs is their tendency to produce outputs that diverge from factual reality. This phenomenon is particularly concerning in sensitive applications such as medical consultation and legal advice, where accuracy is paramount. In this paper, we introduce the LLM factoscope, a novel Siamese network-based model that leverages the inner states of LLMs for factual detection. Our investigation reveals distinguishable patterns in LLMs' inner states when generating factual versus non-factual content. We demonstrate the LLM factoscope's effectiveness across various architectures, achieving over 96% accuracy in factual detection. Our work opens a new avenue for utilizing LLMs' inner states for factual detection and encourages further exploration into LLMs' inner workings for enhanced reliability and transparency.</description>

      <title>QuRating: Selecting High-Quality Data for Training Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Selecting high-quality pre-training data is important for creating capable language models, but existing methods rely on simple heuristics. We introduce QuRating, a method for selecting pre-training data that can capture human intuitions about data quality. In this paper, we investigate four qualities - writing style, required expertise, facts &amp; trivia, and educational value - and find that LLMs are able to discern these qualities, especially when making pairwise judgments of texts. We train a QuRater model to learn scalar ratings from pairwise judgments, and use it to annotate a 260B training corpus with quality ratings for each of the four criteria. In our experiments, we select 30B tokens according to the different quality ratings and train 1.3B-parameter language models on the selected data. We find that it is important to balance quality and diversity. When we sample using quality ratings as logits over documents, our models obtain lower perplexity and stronger in-context learning performance than baselines. Our best model is based on educational value and performs similarly to a model trained with uniform sampling for 50% more steps. Beyond data selection, we use the quality ratings to construct a training curriculum which improves performance without changing the training dataset. We extensively analyze the quality ratings and discuss their characteristics, biases, and wider implications.</description>

      <title>Making Reasoning Matter: Measuring and Improving Faithfulness of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13950v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when asked to reason step-by-step before answering a question. However, it is unclear to what degree the model's final answer is faithful to the stated reasoning steps. In this paper, we perform a causal mediation analysis on twelve LLMs to examine how intermediate reasoning steps generated by the LLM influence the final outcome and find that LLMs do not reliably use their intermediate reasoning steps when generating an answer. To address this issue, we introduce FRODO, a framework to tailor small-sized LMs to generate correct reasoning steps and robustly reason over these steps. FRODO consists of an inference module that learns to generate correct reasoning steps using an implicit causal reward function and a reasoning module that learns to faithfully reason over these intermediate inferences using a counterfactual and causal preference objective. Our experiments show that FRODO significantly outperforms four competitive baselines. Furthermore, FRODO improves the robustness and generalization ability of the reasoning LM, yielding higher performance on out-of-distribution test sets. Finally, we find that FRODO's rationales are more faithful to its final answer predictions than standard supervised fine-tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Live languages continuously evolve to integrate the cultural change of human societies. This evolution manifests through neologisms (new words) or \textbf{semantic changes} of words (new meaning to existing words). Understanding the meaning of words is vital for interpreting texts coming from different cultures (regionalism or slang), domains (e.g., technical terms), or periods. In computer science, these words are relevant to computational linguistics algorithms such as translation, information retrieval, question answering, etc. Semantic changes can potentially impact the quality of the outcomes of these algorithms. Therefore, it is important to understand and characterize these changes formally. The study of this impact is a recent problem that has attracted the attention of the computational linguistics community. Several approaches propose methods to detect semantic changes with good precision, but more effort is needed to characterize how the meaning of words changes and to reason about how to reduce the impact of semantic change. This survey provides an understandable overview of existing approaches to the \textit{characterization of semantic changes} and also formally defines three classes of characterizations: if the meaning of a word becomes more general or narrow (change in dimension) if the word is used in a more pejorative or positive/ameliorated sense (change in orientation), and if there is a trend to use the word in a, for instance, metaphoric or metonymic context (change in relation). We summarized the main aspects of the selected publications in a table and discussed the needs and trends in the research activities on semantic change characterization.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Elementary Multilingual Capabilities of Large Language Models with MultiQ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) need to serve everyone, including a global majority of non-English speakers. However, most LLMs today, and open LLMs in particular, are often intended for use in just English (e.g. Llama2, Mistral) or a small handful of high-resource languages (e.g. Mixtral, Qwen). Recent research shows that, despite limits in their intended use, people prompt LLMs in many different languages. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the basic multilingual capabilities of state-of-the-art open LLMs beyond their intended use. For this purpose, we introduce MultiQ, a new silver standard benchmark for basic open-ended question answering with 27.4k test questions across a typologically diverse set of 137 languages. With MultiQ, we evaluate language fidelity, i.e. whether models respond in the prompted language, and question answering accuracy. All LLMs we test respond faithfully and/or accurately for at least some languages beyond their intended use. Most models are more accurate when they respond faithfully. However, differences across models are large, and there is a long tail of languages where models are neither accurate nor faithful. We explore differences in tokenization as a potential explanation for our findings, identifying possible correlations that warrant further investigation.</description>

      <title>Transformers Get Stable: An End-to-End Signal Propagation Theory for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In spite of their huge success, transformer models remain difficult to scale in depth. In this work, we develop a unified signal propagation theory and provide formulae that govern the moments of the forward and backward signal through the transformer model. Our framework can be used to understand and mitigate vanishing/exploding gradients, rank collapse, and instability associated with high attention scores. We also propose DeepScaleLM, an initialization and scaling scheme that conserves unit output/gradient moments throughout the model, enabling the training of very deep models with 1000 layers. We find that transformer models could be much deeper - our deep models with fewer parameters outperform shallow models in Language Modeling, Speech Translation, and Image Classification, across encoder-only, decoder-only and encoder-decoder variants, for both Pre-LN and Post-LN transformers, for multiple datasets and model sizes. These improvements also translate into improved performance on downstream Question Answering tasks and improved robustness for Image Classification.</description>

      <title>Learning From Correctness Without Prompting Makes LLM Efficient Reasoner</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across various tasks, yet they still exhibit limitations such as hallucination, unfaithful reasoning, and toxic content. One potential approach to mitigate these issues is learning from human or external feedback (e.g. tools). In this paper, we introduce an intrinsic self-correct reasoning framework for LLMs that eliminates the need for human feedback, external tools, and handcraft prompts. The proposed framework, based on a multi-step reasoning paradigm \textbf{Le}arning from \textbf{Co}rrectness (\textsc{LeCo}), improves reasoning performance without needing to learn from errors. This paradigm prioritizes learning from correct reasoning steps, and a unique method to measure confidence for each reasoning step based on generation logits. Experimental results across various multi-step reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in improving reasoning performance with reduced token consumption.</description>

      <title>PairEval: Open-domain Dialogue Evaluation with Pairwise Comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building a reliable and automated evaluation metric is a necessary but challenging problem for open-domain dialogue systems. Recent studies proposed evaluation metrics that assess generated responses by considering their relevance to previous dialogue histories. Although effective, these metrics evaluate individual responses directly rather than considering their relative quality compared to other responses. To handle this, we propose PairEval, a novel dialogue evaluation metric for assessing responses by comparing their quality against responses in different conversations. PairEval is built on top of open-sourced and moderate-size language models, and we make them specialized in pairwise comparison between dialogue responses. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our metric exhibits a higher correlation with human judgments than baseline metrics. We also find that the proposed comparative metric is more robust in detecting common failures from open-domain dialogue systems, including repetition and speaker insensitivity.</description>

      <title>RoT: Enhancing Large Language Models with Reflection on Search Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capability in reasoning and planning when integrated with tree-search-based prompting methods. However, since these methods ignore the previous search experiences, they often make the same mistakes in the search process. To address this issue, we introduce Reflection on search Trees (RoT), an LLM reflection framework designed to improve the performance of tree-search-based prompting methods. It uses a strong LLM to summarize guidelines from previous tree search experiences to enhance the ability of a weak LLM. The guidelines are instructions about solving this task through tree search which can prevent the weak LLMs from making similar mistakes in the past search process. In addition, we proposed a novel state selection method, which identifies the critical information from historical search processes to help RoT generate more specific and meaningful guidelines. In our extensive experiments, we find that RoT significantly improves the performance of LLMs in reasoning or planning tasks with various tree-search-based prompting methods (e.g., BFS and MCTS). Non-tree-search-based prompting methods such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can also benefit from RoT guidelines since RoT can provide task-specific knowledge collected from the search experience.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the widespread availability of LLMs, there remains a substantial gap in their capabilities and availability across diverse languages. One approach to address these issues has been to take an existing pre-trained LLM and continue to train it on new languages. While prior works have experimented with language adaptation, many questions around best practices and methodology have not been covered. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation into the adaptation of LLMs to new languages. Our study covers the key components in this process, including vocabulary extension, direct preference optimization and the data scarcity problem for human alignment in low-resource languages. We scale these experiments across 9 languages and 2 parameter scales (7B and 70B). We compare our models against Llama 2, Aya-101, XGLM, BLOOM and existing language experts, outperforming all prior published baselines. Additionally, all evaluation code and checkpoints are made public to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>SERPENT-VLM : Self-Refining Radiology Report Generation Using Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (R2Gen) demonstrates how Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can automate the creation of accurate and coherent radiological reports. Existing methods often hallucinate details in text-based reports that don't accurately reflect the image content. To mitigate this, we introduce a novel strategy, SERPENT-VLM (SElf Refining Radiology RePort GENeraTion using Vision Language Models), which improves the R2Gen task by integrating a self-refining mechanism into the MLLM framework. We employ a unique self-supervised loss that leverages similarity between pooled image representations and the contextual representations of the generated radiological text, alongside the standard Causal Language Modeling objective, to refine image-text representations. This allows the model to scrutinize and align the generated text through dynamic interaction between a given image and the generated text, therefore reducing hallucination and continuously enhancing nuanced report generation. SERPENT-VLM outperforms existing baselines such as LLaVA-Med, BiomedGPT, etc., achieving SoTA performance on the IU X-ray and Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO) datasets, and also proves to be robust against noisy images. A qualitative case study emphasizes the significant advancements towards more sophisticated MLLM frameworks for R2Gen, opening paths for further research into self-supervised refinement in the medical imaging domain.</description>

      <title>LGDE: Local Graph-based Dictionary Expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Local Graph-based Dictionary Expansion (LGDE), a method for data-driven discovery of the semantic neighbourhood of words using tools from manifold learning and network science. At the heart of LGDE lies the creation of a word similarity graph from the geometry of word embeddings followed by local community detection based on graph diffusion. The diffusion in the local graph manifold allows the exploration of the complex nonlinear geometry of word embeddings to capture word similarities based on paths of semantic association, over and above direct pairwise similarities. Exploiting such semantic neighbourhoods enables the expansion of dictionaries of pre-selected keywords, an important step for tasks in information retrieval, such as database queries and online data collection. We validate LGDE on a corpus of English-language hate speech-related posts from Reddit and Gab and show that LGDE enriches the list of keywords with significantly better performance than threshold methods based on direct word similarities. We further demonstrate our method through a real-world use case from communication science, where LGDE is evaluated quantitatively on the expansion of a conspiracy-related dictionary from online data collected and analysed by domain experts. Our empirical results and expert user assessment indicate that LGDE expands the seed dictionary with more useful keywords due to the manifold-learning-based similarity network.</description>

Abstract: Recent work has shown the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve tasks related to Knowledge Graphs, such as Knowledge Graph Completion, even in Zero- or Few-Shot paradigms. However, they are known to hallucinate answers, or output results in a non-deterministic manner, thus leading to wrongly reasoned responses, even if they satisfy the user's demands. To highlight opportunities and challenges in knowledge graphs-related tasks, we experiment with three distinguished LLMs, namely Mixtral-8x7b-Instruct-v0.1, GPT-3.5-Turbo-0125 and GPT-4o, on Knowledge Graph Completion for static knowledge graphs, using prompts constructed following the TELeR taxonomy, in Zero- and One-Shot contexts, on a Task-Oriented Dialogue system use case. When evaluated using both strict and flexible metrics measurement manners, our results show that LLMs could be fit for such a task if prompts encapsulate sufficient information and relevant examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When using language models (LMs) to solve complex problems, humans might struggle to understand the LM-generated solutions and repair the flawed ones. To assist humans in repairing them, we propose to automatically decompose complex solutions into multiple simpler pieces that correspond to specific subtasks. We introduce a novel objective for learning task decomposition, termed assistive value (AssistV), which measures the feasibility and speed for humans to repair the decomposed solution. We collect a dataset of human repair experiences on different decomposed solutions. Utilizing the collected data as in-context examples, we then learn to critique, refine, and rank decomposed solutions to improve AssistV. We validate our method under competitive programming problems: under 177 hours of human study, our method enables non-experts to solve 33.3\% more problems, speeds them up by 3.3x, and empowers them to match unassisted experts.</description>

      <title>Beyond Words: On Large Language Models Actionability in Mission-Critical Risk Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10273v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Risk analysis assesses potential risks in specific scenarios. Risk analysis principles are context-less; the same methodology can be applied to a risk connected to health and information technology security. Risk analysis requires a vast knowledge of national and international regulations and standards and is time and effort-intensive. A large language model can quickly summarize information in less time than a human and can be fine-tuned to specific tasks.
  Aim. Our empirical study aims to investigate the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation and fine-tuned LLM in risk analysis. To our knowledge, no prior study has explored its capabilities in risk analysis.
  Method. We manually curated 193 unique scenarios leading to 1283 representative samples from over 50 mission-critical analyses archived by the industrial context team in the last five years. We compared the base GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models versus their Retrieval-Augmented Generation and fine-tuned counterparts. We employ two human experts as competitors of the models and three other human experts to review the models and the former human experts' analysis. The reviewers analyzed 5,000 scenario analyses.
  Results and Conclusions. Human experts demonstrated higher accuracy, but LLMs are quicker and more actionable. Moreover, our findings show that RAG-assisted LLMs have the lowest hallucination rates, effectively uncovering hidden risks and complementing human expertise. Thus, the choice of model depends on specific needs, with FTMs for accuracy, RAG for hidden risks discovery, and base models for comprehensiveness and actionability. Therefore, experts can leverage LLMs as an effective complementing companion in risk analysis within a condensed timeframe. They can also save costs by averting unnecessary expenses associated with implementing unwarranted countermeasures.</description>

Abstract: The integration of pretrained language models (PLMs) like BERT and GPT has revolutionized NLP, particularly for English, but it has also created linguistic imbalances. This paper strategically identifies the need for linguistic equity by examining several knowledge editing techniques in multilingual contexts. We evaluate the performance of models such as Mistral, TowerInstruct, OpenHathi, Tamil-Llama, and Kan-Llama across languages including English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Hindi, Tamil, and Kannada. Our research identifies significant discrepancies in normal and merged models concerning cross-lingual consistency. We employ strategies like 'each language for itself' (ELFI) and 'each language for others' (ELFO) to stress-test these models. Our findings demonstrate the potential for LLMs to overcome linguistic barriers, laying the groundwork for future research in achieving linguistic inclusivity in AI technologies.</description>

      <title>Self-play with Execution Feedback: Improving Instruction-following Capabilities of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One core capability of large language models (LLMs) is to follow natural language instructions. However, the issue of automatically constructing high-quality training data to enhance the complex instruction-following abilities of LLMs without manual annotation remains unresolved. In this paper, we introduce AutoIF, the first scalable and reliable method for automatically generating instruction-following training data. AutoIF transforms the validation of instruction-following data quality into code verification, requiring LLMs to generate instructions, the corresponding code to check the correctness of the instruction responses, and unit test samples to verify the code's correctness. Then, execution feedback-based rejection sampling can generate data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) training. AutoIF achieves significant improvements across three training algorithms, SFT, Offline DPO, and Online DPO, when applied to the top open-source LLMs, Qwen2 and LLaMA3, in self-alignment and strong-to-weak distillation settings. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/QwenLM/AutoIF.</description>

      <title>Understand What LLM Needs: Dual Preference Alignment for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated effectiveness in mitigating the hallucination problem of large language models (LLMs). However, the difficulty of aligning the retriever with the diverse LLMs' knowledge preferences inevitably poses an inevitable challenge in developing a reliable RAG system. To address this issue, we propose DPA-RAG, a universal framework designed to align diverse knowledge preferences within RAG systems. Specifically, we initially introduce a preference knowledge construction pipline and incorporate five novel query augmentation strategies to alleviate preference data scarcity. Based on preference data, DPA-RAG accomplishes both external and internal preference alignment: 1) It jointly integrate pair-wise, point-wise, and contrastive preference alignment abilities into the reranker, achieving external preference alignment among RAG components. 2) It further introduces a pre-aligned stage before vanilla Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT), enabling LLMs to implicitly capture knowledge aligned with their reasoning preferences, achieving LLMs' internal alignment. Experimental results across four knowledge-intensive QA datasets demonstrate that DPA-RAG outperforms all baselines and seamlessly integrates both black-box and open-sourced LLM readers. Further qualitative analysis and discussions also provide empirical guidance for achieving reliable RAG systems. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/dongguanting/DPA-RAG.</description>

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLM) with Knowledge Representation Learning (KRL) signifies a significant advancement in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), enhancing the ability to capture and utilize both structure and textual information. Despite the increasing research on enhancing KRL with LLMs, a thorough survey that analyse processes of these enhanced models is conspicuously absent. Our survey addresses this by categorizing these models based on three distinct Transformer architectures, and by analyzing experimental data from various KRL downstream tasks to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Finally, we identify and explore potential future research directions in this emerging yet underexplored domain.</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has facilitated their transformation into conversational chatbots that can grasp contextual nuances and generate pertinent sentences, closely mirroring human values through advanced techniques such as instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, the computational efficiency required for LLMs, achieved through techniques like post-training quantization (PTQ), presents challenges such as token-flipping that can impair chatbot performance. In response, we propose a novel preference alignment approach, quantization-aware direct preference optimization (QDPO), that aligns quantized LLMs with their full-precision counterparts, improving conversational abilities. Evaluated on two instruction-tuned LLMs in various languages, QDPO demonstrated superior performance in improving conversational abilities compared to established PTQ and knowledge-distillation fine-tuning techniques, marking a significant step forward in the development of efficient and effective conversational LLMs.</description>

      <title>PAS: Data-Efficient Plug-and-Play Prompt Augmentation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06027v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred a growing demand for plug-and-play AI systems. Among the various AI techniques, prompt engineering stands out as particularly significant. However, users often face challenges in writing prompts due to the steep learning curve and significant time investment, and existing automatic prompt engineering (APE) models can be difficult to use. To address this issue, we propose PAS, an LLM-based plug-and-play APE system. PAS utilizes LLMs trained on high-quality, automatically generated prompt complementary datasets, resulting in exceptional performance. In comprehensive benchmarks, PAS achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results compared to previous APE models, with an average improvement of 6.09 points. Moreover, PAS is highly efficient, achieving SoTA performance with only 9000 data points. Additionally, PAS can autonomously generate prompt augmentation data without requiring additional human labor. Its flexibility also allows it to be compatible with all existing LLMs and applicable to a wide range of tasks. PAS excels in human evaluations, underscoring its suitability as a plug-in for users. This combination of high performance, efficiency, and flexibility makes PAS a valuable system for enhancing the usability and effectiveness of LLMs through improved prompt engineering.</description>

      <title>Pronunciation Assessment with Multi-modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), renowned for their powerful conversational abilities, are widely recognized as exceptional tools in the field of education, particularly in the context of automated intelligent instruction systems for language learning. In this paper, we propose a scoring system based on LLMs, motivated by their positive impact on text-related scoring tasks. Specifically, the speech encoder first maps the learner's speech into contextual features. The adapter layer then transforms these features to align with the text embedding in latent space. The assessment task-specific prefix and prompt text are embedded and concatenated with the features generated by the modality adapter layer, enabling the LLMs to predict accuracy and fluency scores. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed scoring systems achieve competitive results compared to the baselines on the Speechocean762 datasets. Moreover, we also conducted an ablation study to better understand the contributions of the prompt text and training strategy in the proposed scoring system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instruction-tuned large language models, such as T0, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in following instructions across various domains. However, their proficiency remains notably deficient in many low-resource languages. To address this challenge, we introduce FarsInstruct: a comprehensive instruction dataset designed to enhance the instruction-following ability of large language models specifically for the Persian language, a significant yet underrepresented language globally. FarsInstruct encompasses a wide range of task types and datasets, each containing a mix of straightforward to complex manual written instructions, as well as translations from Public Pool of Prompts, ensuring a rich linguistic and cultural representation. Furthermore, we introduce Co-CoLA, a framework designed to enhance the multi-task adaptability of LoRA-tuned models. Through extensive experimental analyses, our study showcases the effectiveness of FarsInstruct dataset coupled with training by Co-CoLA framework, in improving the performance of large language models within the Persian context. As of the current writing, FarsInstruct comprises more than 200 templates across 21 distinct datasets, and we intend to update it consistently, thus augmenting its applicability.</description>

      <title>PersLLM: A Personified Training Approach for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models exhibit aspects of human-level intelligence that catalyze their application as human-like agents in domains such as social simulations, human-machine interactions, and collaborative multi-agent systems. However, the absence of distinct personalities, such as displaying ingratiating behaviors, inconsistent opinions, and uniform response patterns, diminish LLMs utility in practical applications. Addressing this, the development of personality traits in LLMs emerges as a crucial area of research to unlock their latent potential. Existing methods to personify LLMs generally involve strategies like employing stylized training data for instruction tuning or using prompt engineering to simulate different personalities. These methods only capture superficial linguistic styles instead of the core of personalities and are therefore not stable. In this study, we propose PersLLM, integrating psychology-grounded principles of personality: social practice, consistency, and dynamic development, into a comprehensive training methodology. We incorporate personality traits directly into the model parameters, enhancing the model's resistance to induction, promoting consistency, and supporting the dynamic evolution of personality. Single-agent evaluation validates our method's superiority, as it produces responses more aligned with reference personalities compared to other approaches. Case studies for multi-agent communication highlight its benefits in enhancing opinion consistency within individual agents and fostering collaborative creativity among multiple agents in dialogue contexts, potentially benefiting human simulation and multi-agent cooperation. Additionally, human-agent interaction evaluations indicate that our personified models significantly enhance interactive experiences, underscoring the practical implications of our research.</description>

      <title>Sparse-IFT: Sparse Iso-FLOP Transformations for Maximizing Training Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11525v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research has focused on weight sparsity in deep neural network training to reduce FLOPs, aiming for improved efficiency (test accuracy w.r.t training FLOPs). However, sparse weight training often compromises accuracy, requiring extended training schedules to attain the accuracy of dense models. In contrast, our approach, Sparse Iso-FLOP Transformations (Sparse-IFT), uses sparsity to improve accuracy while maintaining dense model FLOPs. Using a single hyperparameter (i.e., the sparsity level), Sparse-IFTs efficiently replace dense layers, expanding the search space for optimal sparse masks. In addition, dynamic sparse training (DST) with Sparse-IFT models effectively navigate this larger sparse mask-weight space, which is evidenced by a spectral analysis using Ramanujan graph properties. Our study reveals a robust correlation among mask topology, weights, and final performance. Notably, without adjusting any training hyperparameters, replacing dense layers with Sparse-IFT yields significant improvements, such as a +3.5% boost for ResNet-18 on ImageNet and +0.9% for GPT-3 Small on the Open LLM leaderboard. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the use of sparsity for improving the accuracy of dense models through a set of simple-to-use sparse transformations.

      <title>Beyond Chinchilla-Optimal: Accounting for Inference in Language Model Scaling Laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) scaling laws are empirical formulas that estimate changes in model quality as a result of increasing parameter count and training data. However, these formulas, including the popular Deepmind Chinchilla scaling laws, neglect to include the cost of inference. We modify the Chinchilla scaling laws to calculate the optimal LLM parameter count and pre-training data size to train and deploy a model of a given quality and inference demand. We conduct our analysis both in terms of a compute budget and real-world costs and find that LLM researchers expecting reasonably large inference demand (~1B requests) should train models smaller and longer than Chinchilla-optimal. Furthermore, we train 47 models of varying sizes and parameter counts to validate our formula and find that model quality continues to improve as we scale tokens per parameter to extreme ranges (up to 10,000). Finally, we ablate the procedure used to fit the Chinchilla scaling law coefficients and find that developing scaling laws only from data collected at typical token/parameter ratios overestimates the impact of additional tokens at these extreme ranges.</description>

      <title>Advancing Large Multi-modal Models with Explicit Chain-of-Reasoning and Visual Question Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for intelligent systems capable of interpreting and reasoning about visual content requires the development of large Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs) that are not only accurate but also have explicit reasoning capabilities. This paper presents a novel approach to develop a VLM with the ability to conduct explicit reasoning based on visual content and textual instructions. We introduce a system that can ask a question to acquire necessary knowledge, thereby enhancing the robustness and explicability of the reasoning process. To this end, we developed a novel dataset generated by a Large Language Model (LLM), designed to promote chain-of-thought reasoning combined with a question-asking mechanism. The dataset covers a range of tasks, from common ones like caption generation to specialized VQA tasks that require expert knowledge. Furthermore, using the dataset we created, we fine-tuned an existing VLM. This training enabled the models to generate questions and perform iterative reasoning during inference. The results demonstrated a stride toward a more robust, accurate, and interpretable VLM, capable of reasoning explicitly and seeking information proactively when confronted with ambiguous visual input.</description>

      <title>Common Sense Reasoning for Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art deepfake detection approaches rely on image-based features extracted via neural networks. While these approaches trained in a supervised manner extract likely fake features, they may fall short in representing unnatural `non-physical' semantic facial attributes -- blurry hairlines, double eyebrows, rigid eye pupils, or unnatural skin shading. However, such facial attributes are easily perceived by humans and used to discern the authenticity of an image based on human common sense. Furthermore, image-based feature extraction methods that provide visual explanations via saliency maps can be hard to interpret for humans. To address these challenges, we frame deepfake detection as a Deepfake Detection VQA (DD-VQA) task and model human intuition by providing textual explanations that describe common sense reasons for labeling an image as real or fake. We introduce a new annotated dataset and propose a Vision and Language Transformer-based framework for the DD-VQA task. We also incorporate text and image-aware feature alignment formulation to enhance multi-modal representation learning. As a result, we improve upon existing deepfake detection models by integrating our learned vision representations, which reason over common sense knowledge from the DD-VQA task. We provide extensive empirical results demonstrating that our method enhances detection performance, generalization ability, and language-based interpretability in the deepfake detection task.</description>

      <title>BIMCV-R: A Landmark Dataset for 3D CT Text-Image Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The burgeoning integration of 3D medical imaging into healthcare has led to a substantial increase in the workload of medical professionals. To assist clinicians in their diagnostic processes and alleviate their workload, the development of a robust system for retrieving similar case studies presents a viable solution. While the concept holds great promise, the field of 3D medical text-image retrieval is currently limited by the absence of robust evaluation benchmarks and curated datasets. To remedy this, our study presents a groundbreaking dataset, {BIMCV-R}, which includes an extensive collection of 8,069 3D CT volumes, encompassing over 2 million slices, paired with their respective radiological reports. Expanding upon the foundational work of our dataset, we craft a retrieval strategy, MedFinder. This approach employs a dual-stream network architecture, harnessing the potential of large language models to advance the field of medical image retrieval beyond existing text-image retrieval solutions. It marks our preliminary step towards developing a system capable of facilitating text-to-image, image-to-text, and keyword-based retrieval tasks. Our project is available at \url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/cyd0806/BIMCV-R}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address prevailing challenges of the brain-powered research, departing from the observation that the literature hardly recover accurate spatial information and require subject-specific models. To address these challenges, we propose UMBRAE, a unified multimodal decoding of brain signals. First, to extract instance-level conceptual and spatial details from neural signals, we introduce an efficient universal brain encoder for multimodal-brain alignment and recover object descriptions at multiple levels of granularity from subsequent multimodal large language model (MLLM). Second, we introduce a cross-subject training strategy mapping subject-specific features to a common feature space. This allows a model to be trained on multiple subjects without extra resources, even yielding superior results compared to subject-specific models. Further, we demonstrate this supports weakly-supervised adaptation to new subjects, with only a fraction of the total training data. Experiments demonstrate that UMBRAE not only achieves superior results in the newly introduced tasks but also outperforms methods in well established tasks. To assess our method, we construct and share with the community a comprehensive brain understanding benchmark BrainHub. Our code and benchmark are available at https://weihaox.github.io/UMBRAE.</description>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enhance the capabilities of standard large language models by integrating and processing data from multiple modalities, including text, vision, audio, video, and 3D environments. Data plays a pivotal role in the development and refinement of these models. In this survey, we comprehensively review the literature on MLLMs from a data-centric perspective. Specifically, we explore methods for preparing multimodal data during the pretraining and adaptation phases of MLLMs. Additionally, we analyze the evaluation methods for the datasets and review the benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs. Our survey also outlines potential future research directions. This work aims to provide researchers with a detailed understanding of the data-driven aspects of MLLMs, fostering further exploration and innovation in this field.</description>

      <title>PrE-Text: Training Language Models on Private Federated Data in the Age of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-device training is currently the most common approach for training machine learning (ML) models on private, distributed user data. Despite this, on-device training has several drawbacks: (1) most user devices are too small to train large models on-device, (2) on-device training is communication- and computation-intensive, and (3) on-device training can be difficult to debug and deploy. To address these problems, we propose Private Evolution-Text (PrE-Text), a method for generating differentially private (DP) synthetic textual data. First, we show that across multiple datasets, training small models (models that fit on user devices) with PrE-Text synthetic data outperforms small models trained on-device under practical privacy regimes ($\epsilon=1.29$, $\epsilon=7.58$). We achieve these results while using 9$\times$ fewer rounds, 6$\times$ less client computation per round, and 100$\times$ less communication per round. Second, finetuning large models on PrE-Text's DP synthetic data improves large language model (LLM) performance on private data across the same range of privacy budgets. Altogether, these results suggest that training on DP synthetic data can be a better option than training a model on-device on private distributed data.

      <title>QJL: 1-Bit Quantized JL Transform for KV Cache Quantization with Zero Overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Serving LLMs requires substantial memory due to the storage requirements of Key-Value (KV) embeddings in the KV cache, which grows with sequence length. An effective approach to compress KV cache is quantization. However, traditional quantization methods face significant memory overhead due to the need to store quantization constants (at least a zero point and a scale) in full precision per data block. Depending on the block size, this overhead can add 1 or 2 bits per quantized number. We introduce QJL, a new quantization approach that consists of a Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) transform followed by sign-bit quantization. In contrast to existing methods, QJL eliminates memory overheads by removing the need for storing quantization constants. We propose an asymmetric estimator for the inner product of two vectors and demonstrate that applying QJL to one vector and a standard JL transform without quantization to the other provides an unbiased estimator with minimal distortion. We have developed an efficient implementation of the QJL sketch and its corresponding inner product estimator, incorporating a lightweight CUDA kernel for optimized computation. When applied across various LLMs and NLP tasks to quantize the KV cache to only 3 bits, QJL demonstrates a more than fivefold reduction in KV cache memory usage without compromising accuracy, all while achieving faster runtime.

      <title>HORAE: A Domain-Agnostic Modeling Language for Automating Multimodal Service Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is rapidly encroaching on the field of service regulation. This work presents the design principles behind HORAE, a unified specification language to model multimodal regulation rules across a diverse set of domains. We show how HORAE facilitates an intelligent service regulation pipeline by further exploiting a fine-tuned large language model named HORAE that automates the HORAE modeling process, thereby yielding an end-to-end framework for fully automated intelligent service regulation.</description>

      <title>A Labelled Dataset for Sentiment Analysis of Videos on YouTube, TikTok, and Other Sources about the 2024 Outbreak of Measles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The work of this paper presents a dataset that contains the data of 4011 videos about the ongoing outbreak of measles published on 264 websites on the internet between January 1, 2024, and May 31, 2024. The dataset is available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/40s8-xf63. These websites primarily include YouTube and TikTok, which account for 48.6% and 15.2% of the videos, respectively. The remainder of the websites include Instagram and Facebook as well as the websites of various global and local news organizations. For each of these videos, the URL of the video, title of the post, description of the post, and the date of publication of the video are presented as separate attributes in the dataset. After developing this dataset, sentiment analysis (using VADER), subjectivity analysis (using TextBlob), and fine-grain sentiment analysis (using DistilRoBERTa-base) of the video titles and video descriptions were performed. This included classifying each video title and video description into (i) one of the sentiment classes i.e. positive, negative, or neutral, (ii) one of the subjectivity classes i.e. highly opinionated, neutral opinionated, or least opinionated, and (iii) one of the fine-grain sentiment classes i.e. fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, or neutral. These results are presented as separate attributes in the dataset for the training and testing of machine learning algorithms for performing sentiment analysis or subjectivity analysis in this field as well as for other applications. Finally, this paper also presents a list of open research questions that may be investigated using this dataset.</description>

      <title>Open-Source Conversational AI with SpeechBrain 1.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00463v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SpeechBrain is an open-source Conversational AI toolkit based on PyTorch, focused particularly on speech processing tasks such as speech recognition, speech enhancement, speaker recognition, text-to-speech, and much more. It promotes transparency and replicability by releasing both the pre-trained models and the complete "recipes" of code and algorithms required for training them. This paper presents SpeechBrain 1.0, a significant milestone in the evolution of the toolkit, which now has over 200 recipes for speech, audio, and language processing tasks, and more than 100 models available on Hugging Face. SpeechBrain 1.0 introduces new technologies to support diverse learning modalities, Large Language Model (LLM) integration, and advanced decoding strategies, along with novel models, tasks, and modalities. It also includes a new benchmark repository, offering researchers a unified platform for evaluating models across diverse tasks.</description>

      <title>Future Events as Backdoor Triggers: Investigating Temporal Vulnerabilities in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backdoors are hidden behaviors that are only triggered once an AI system has been deployed. Bad actors looking to create successful backdoors must design them to avoid activation during training and evaluation. Since data used in these stages often only contains information about events that have already occurred, a component of a simple backdoor trigger could be a model recognizing data that is in the future relative to when it was trained. Through prompting experiments and by probing internal activations, we show that current large language models (LLMs) can distinguish past from future events, with probes on model activations achieving 90% accuracy. We train models with backdoors triggered by a temporal distributional shift; they activate when the model is exposed to news headlines beyond their training cut-off dates. Fine-tuning on helpful, harmless and honest (HHH) data does not work well for removing simpler backdoor triggers but is effective on our backdoored models, although this distinction is smaller for the larger-scale model we tested. We also find that an activation-steering vector representing a model's internal representation of the date influences the rate of backdoor activation. We take these results as initial evidence that, at least for models at the modest scale we test, standard safety measures are enough to remove these backdoors.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Vision Language Models for Cultural Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models and vision-language pre-training have notably advanced Vision Language Models (VLMs), enabling multimodal processing of visual and linguistic data. However, their performance has been typically assessed on general scene understanding - recognizing objects, attributes, and actions - rather than cultural comprehension. This study introduces CulturalVQA, a visual question-answering benchmark aimed at assessing VLM's geo-diverse cultural understanding. We curate a collection of 2,378 image-question pairs with 1-5 answers per question representing cultures from 11 countries across 5 continents. The questions probe understanding of various facets of culture such as clothing, food, drinks, rituals, and traditions. Benchmarking VLMs on CulturalVQA, including GPT-4V and Gemini, reveals disparity in their level of cultural understanding across regions, with strong cultural understanding capabilities for North America while significantly lower performance for Africa. We observe disparity in their performance across cultural facets too, with clothing, rituals, and traditions seeing higher performances than food and drink. These disparities help us identify areas where VLMs lack cultural understanding and demonstrate the potential of CulturalVQA as a comprehensive evaluation set for gauging VLM progress in understanding diverse cultures.</description>

      <title>Unconstrained Open Vocabulary Image Classification: Zero-Shot Transfer from Text to Image via CLIP Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce NOVIC, an innovative uNconstrained Open Vocabulary Image Classifier that uses an autoregressive transformer to generatively output classification labels as language. Leveraging the extensive knowledge of CLIP models, NOVIC harnesses the embedding space to enable zero-shot transfer from pure text to images. Traditional CLIP models, despite their ability for open vocabulary classification, require an exhaustive prompt of potential class labels, restricting their application to images of known content or context. To address this, we propose an "object decoder" model that is trained on a large-scale 92M-target dataset of templated object noun sets and LLM-generated captions to always output the object noun in question. This effectively inverts the CLIP text encoder and allows textual object labels to be generated directly from image-derived embedding vectors, without requiring any a priori knowledge of the potential content of an image. The trained decoders are tested on a mix of manually and web-curated datasets, as well as standard image classification benchmarks, and achieve fine-grained prompt-free prediction scores of up to 87.5%, a strong result considering the model must work for any conceivable image and without any contextual clues.</description>
