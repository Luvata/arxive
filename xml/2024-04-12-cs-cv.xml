      <title>Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation with Offline Diffusion-Augmented Prototype Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims at segmenting arbitrary categories expressed in textual form. Previous works have trained over large amounts of image-caption pairs to enforce pixel-level multimodal alignments. However, captions provide global information about the semantics of a given image but lack direct localization of individual concepts. Further, training on large-scale datasets inevitably brings significant computational costs. In this paper, we propose FreeDA, a training-free diffusion-augmented method for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which leverages the ability of diffusion models to visually localize generated concepts and local-global similarities to match class-agnostic regions with semantic classes. Our approach involves an offline stage in which textual-visual reference embeddings are collected, starting from a large set of captions and leveraging visual and semantic contexts. At test time, these are queried to support the visual matching process, which is carried out by jointly considering class-agnostic regions and global semantic similarities. Extensive analyses demonstrate that FreeDA achieves state-of-the-art performance on five datasets, surpassing previous methods by more than 7.0 average points in terms of mIoU and without requiring any training.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Print-and-Scan in Heterogeneous Morph Evaluation Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face morphing attacks present an emerging threat to the face recognition system. On top of that, printing and scanning the morphed images could obscure the artifacts generated during the morphing process, which makes morphed image detection even harder. In this work, we investigate the impact that printing and scanning has on morphing attacks through a series of heterogeneous tests. Our experiments show that we can increase the possibility of a false match by up to 5.64% for DiM and 16.00% for StyleGAN2 when providing an image that has been printed and scanned, regardless it is morphed or bona fide, to a Face Recognition (FR) system. Likewise, using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) metric, strictly print-scanned morph attacks performed on average 9.185% stronger than non-print-scanned digital morphs.</description>

      <title>MambaAD: Exploring State Space Models for Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in anomaly detection have seen the efficacy of CNN- and transformer-based approaches. However, CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, while transformers are burdened by quadratic computational complexity. Mamba-based models, with their superior long-range modeling and linear efficiency, have garnered substantial attention. This study pioneers the application of Mamba to multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection, presenting MambaAD, which consists of a pre-trained encoder and a Mamba decoder featuring Locality-Enhanced State Space (LSS) modules at multi-scales. The proposed LSS module, integrating parallel cascaded (Hybrid State Space) HSS blocks and multi-kernel convolutions operations, effectively captures both long-range and local information. The HSS block, utilizing (Hybrid Scanning) HS encoders, encodes feature maps into five scanning methods and eight directions, thereby strengthening global connections through the (State Space Model) SSM. The use of Hilbert scanning and eight directions significantly improves feature sequence modeling. Comprehensive experiments on six diverse anomaly detection datasets and seven metrics demonstrate SoTA performance, substantiating the method's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Spatially Optimized Compact Deep Metric Learning Model for Similarity Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial optimization is often overlooked in many computer vision tasks. Filters should be able to recognize the features of an object regardless of where it is in the image. Similarity search is a crucial task where spatial features decide an important output. The capacity of convolution to capture visual patterns across various locations is limited. In contrast to convolution, the involution kernel is dynamically created at each pixel based on the pixel value and parameters that have been learned. This study demonstrates that utilizing a single layer of involution feature extractor alongside a compact convolution model significantly enhances the performance of similarity search. Additionally, we improve predictions by using the GELU activation function rather than the ReLU. The negligible amount of weight parameters in involution with a compact model with better performance makes the model very useful in real-world implementations. Our proposed model is below 1 megabyte in size. We have experimented with our proposed methodology and other models on CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, and MNIST datasets. Our proposed method outperforms across all three datasets.</description>

      <title>RoadBEV: Road Surface Reconstruction in Bird's Eye View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Road surface conditions, especially geometry profiles, enormously affect driving performance of autonomous vehicles. Vision-based online road reconstruction promisingly captures road information in advance. Existing solutions like monocular depth estimation and stereo matching suffer from modest performance. The recent technique of Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) perception provides immense potential to more reliable and accurate reconstruction. This paper uniformly proposes two simple yet effective models for road elevation reconstruction in BEV named RoadBEV-mono and RoadBEV-stereo, which estimate road elevation with monocular and stereo images, respectively. The former directly fits elevation values based on voxel features queried from image view, while the latter efficiently recognizes road elevation patterns based on BEV volume representing discrepancy between left and right voxel features. Insightful analyses reveal their consistence and difference with perspective view. Experiments on real-world dataset verify the models' effectiveness and superiority. Elevation errors of RoadBEV-mono and RoadBEV-stereo achieve 1.83cm and 0.56cm, respectively. The estimation performance improves by 50\% in BEV based on monocular image. Our models are promising for practical applications, providing valuable references for vision-based BEV perception in autonomous driving.

      <title>Calibrating Higher-Order Statistics for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning with Pre-trained Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to adapt the model to new classes from very few data (5 samples) without forgetting the previously learned classes. Recent works in many-shot CIL (MSCIL) (using all available training data) exploited pre-trained models to reduce forgetting and achieve better plasticity. In a similar fashion, we use ViT models pre-trained on large-scale datasets for few-shot settings, which face the critical issue of low plasticity. FSCIL methods start with a many-shot first task to learn a very good feature extractor and then move to the few-shot setting from the second task onwards. While the focus of most recent studies is on how to learn the many-shot first task so that the model generalizes to all future few-shot tasks, we explore in this work how to better model the few-shot data using pre-trained models, irrespective of how the first task is trained. Inspired by recent works in MSCIL, we explore how using higher-order feature statistics can influence the classification of few-shot classes. We identify the main challenge of obtaining a good covariance matrix from few-shot data and propose to calibrate the covariance matrix for new classes based on semantic similarity to the many-shot base classes. Using the calibrated feature statistics in combination with existing methods significantly improves few-shot continual classification on several FSCIL benchmarks.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GeoSynth, a model for synthesizing satellite images with global style and image-driven layout control. The global style control is via textual prompts or geographic location. These enable the specification of scene semantics or regional appearance respectively, and can be used together. We train our model on a large dataset of paired satellite imagery, with automatically generated captions, and OpenStreetMap data. We evaluate various combinations of control inputs, including different types of layout controls. Results demonstrate that our model can generate diverse, high-quality images and exhibits excellent zero-shot generalization. The code and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/mvrl/GeoSynth.</description>

      <title>FlameFinder: Illuminating Obscured Fire through Smoke with Attentive Deep Metric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FlameFinder is a deep metric learning (DML) framework designed to accurately detect flames, even when obscured by smoke, using thermal images from firefighter drones during wildfire monitoring. Traditional RGB cameras struggle in such conditions, but thermal cameras can capture smoke-obscured flame features. However, they lack absolute thermal reference points, leading to false positives.To address this issue, FlameFinder utilizes paired thermal-RGB images for training. By learning latent flame features from smoke-free samples, the model becomes less biased towards relative thermal gradients. In testing, it identifies flames in smoky patches by analyzing their equivalent thermal-domain distribution. This method improves performance using both supervised and distance-based clustering metrics.The framework incorporates a flame segmentation method and a DML-aided detection framework. This includes utilizing center loss (CL), triplet center loss (TCL), and triplet cosine center loss (TCCL) to identify optimal cluster representatives for classification. However, the dominance of center loss over the other losses leads to the model missing features sensitive to them. To address this limitation, an attention mechanism is proposed. This mechanism allows for non-uniform feature contribution, amplifying the critical role of cosine and triplet loss in the DML framework. Additionally, it improves interpretability, class discrimination, and decreases intra-class variance. As a result, the proposed model surpasses the baseline by 4.4% in the FLAME2 dataset and 7% in the FLAME3 dataset for unobscured flame detection accuracy. Moreover, it demonstrates enhanced class separation in obscured scenarios compared to VGG19, ResNet18, and three backbone models tailored for flame detection.</description>

      <title>Efficient Denoising using Score Embedding in Score-based Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that training a denoising score-based diffusion models requires tens of thousands of epochs and a substantial number of image data to train the model. In this paper, we propose to increase the efficiency in training score-based diffusion models. Our method allows us to decrease the number of epochs needed to train the diffusion model. We accomplish this by solving the log-density Fokker-Planck (FP) Equation numerically to compute the score \textit{before} training. The pre-computed score is embedded into the image to encourage faster training under slice Wasserstein distance. Consequently, it also allows us to decrease the number of images we need to train the neural network to learn an accurate score. We demonstrate through our numerical experiments the improved performance of our proposed method compared to standard score-based diffusion models. Our proposed method achieves a similar quality to the standard method meaningfully faster.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Document Presentation Attack Detection With Forensics Trace Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document Presentation Attack Detection (DPAD) is an important measure in protecting the authenticity of a document image. However, recent DPAD methods demand additional resources, such as manual effort in collecting additional data or knowing the parameters of acquisition devices. This work proposes a DPAD method based on multi-modal disentangled traces (MMDT) without the above drawbacks. We first disentangle the recaptured traces by a self-supervised disentanglement and synthesis network to enhance the generalization capacity in document images with different contents and layouts. Then, unlike the existing DPAD approaches that rely only on data in the RGB domain, we propose to explicitly employ the disentangled recaptured traces as new modalities in the transformer backbone through adaptive multi-modal adapters to fuse RGB/trace features efficiently. Visualization of the disentangled traces confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method in different document contents. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our MMDT method on representing forensic traces of recapturing distortion.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Data Assimilation in Multimodal Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust integration of physical knowledge and data is key to improve computational simulations, such as Earth system models. Data assimilation is crucial for achieving this goal because it provides a systematic framework to calibrate model outputs with observations, which can include remote sensing imagery and ground station measurements, with uncertainty quantification. Conventional methods, including Kalman filters and variational approaches, inherently rely on simplifying linear and Gaussian assumptions, and can be computationally expensive. Nevertheless, with the rapid adoption of data-driven methods in many areas of computational sciences, we see the potential of emulating traditional data assimilation with deep learning, especially generative models. In particular, the diffusion-based probabilistic framework has large overlaps with data assimilation principles: both allows for conditional generation of samples with a Bayesian inverse framework. These models have shown remarkable success in text-conditioned image generation or image-controlled video synthesis. Likewise, one can frame data assimilation as observation-conditioned state calibration. In this work, we propose SLAMS: Score-based Latent Assimilation in Multimodal Setting. Specifically, we assimilate in-situ weather station data and ex-situ satellite imagery to calibrate the vertical temperature profiles, globally. Through extensive ablation, we demonstrate that SLAMS is robust even in low-resolution, noisy, and sparse data settings. To our knowledge, our work is the first to apply deep generative framework for multimodal data assimilation using real-world datasets; an important step for building robust computational simulators, including the next-generation Earth system models.

      <title>SafeGen: Mitigating Unsafe Content Generation in Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models, such as Stable Diffusion, have exhibited remarkable performance in generating high-quality images from text descriptions in recent years. However, text-to-image models may be tricked into generating not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, particularly in sexual scenarios. Existing countermeasures mostly focus on filtering inappropriate inputs and outputs, or suppressing improper text embeddings, which can block explicit NSFW-related content (e.g., naked or sexy) but may still be vulnerable to adversarial prompts inputs that appear innocent but are ill-intended. In this paper, we present SafeGen, a framework to mitigate unsafe content generation by text-to-image models in a text-agnostic manner. The key idea is to eliminate unsafe visual representations from the model regardless of the text input. In this way, the text-to-image model is resistant to adversarial prompts since unsafe visual representations are obstructed from within. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate SafeGen's effectiveness in mitigating unsafe content generation while preserving the high-fidelity of benign images. SafeGen outperforms eight state-of-the-art baseline methods and achieves 99.1% sexual content removal performance. Furthermore, our constructed benchmark of adversarial prompts provides a basis for future development and evaluation of anti-NSFW-generation methods.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Visible-Infrared ReID via Pseudo-label Correction and Modality-level Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (UVI-ReID) has recently gained great attention due to its potential for enhancing human detection in diverse environments without labeling. Previous methods utilize intra-modality clustering and cross-modality feature matching to achieve UVI-ReID. However, there exist two challenges: 1) noisy pseudo labels might be generated in the clustering process, and 2) the cross-modality feature alignment via matching the marginal distribution of visible and infrared modalities may misalign the different identities from two modalities. In this paper, we first conduct a theoretic analysis where an interpretable generalization upper bound is introduced. Based on the analysis, we then propose a novel unsupervised cross-modality person re-identification framework (PRAISE). Specifically, to address the first challenge, we propose a pseudo-label correction strategy that utilizes a Beta Mixture Model to predict the probability of mis-clustering based network's memory effect and rectifies the correspondence by adding a perceptual term to contrastive learning. Next, we introduce a modality-level alignment strategy that generates paired visible-infrared latent features and reduces the modality gap by aligning the labeling function of visible and infrared features to learn identity discriminative and modality-invariant features. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance than the unsupervised visible-ReID methods.</description>

      <title>Perception-Oriented Video Frame Interpolation via Asymmetric Blending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous methods for Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) have encountered challenges, notably the manifestation of blur and ghosting effects. These issues can be traced back to two pivotal factors: unavoidable motion errors and misalignment in supervision. In practice, motion estimates often prove to be error-prone, resulting in misaligned features. Furthermore, the reconstruction loss tends to bring blurry results, particularly in misaligned regions. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a new paradigm called PerVFI (Perception-oriented Video Frame Interpolation). Our approach incorporates an Asymmetric Synergistic Blending module (ASB) that utilizes features from both sides to synergistically blend intermediate features. One reference frame emphasizes primary content, while the other contributes complementary information. To impose a stringent constraint on the blending process, we introduce a self-learned sparse quasi-binary mask which effectively mitigates ghosting and blur artifacts in the output. Additionally, we employ a normalizing flow-based generator and utilize the negative log-likelihood loss to learn the conditional distribution of the output, which further facilitates the generation of clear and fine details. Experimental results validate the superiority of PerVFI, demonstrating significant improvements in perceptual quality compared to existing methods.

      <title>Binomial Self-compensation for Motion Error in Dynamic 3D Scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase shifting profilometry (PSP) is favored in high-precision 3D scanning due to its high accuracy, robustness, and pixel-wise property. However, a fundamental assumption of PSP that the object should remain static is violated in dynamic measurement, making PSP susceptible to object moving, resulting in ripple-like errors in the point clouds. We propose a pixel-wise and frame-wise loopable binomial self-compensation (BSC) algorithm to effectively and flexibly eliminate motion error in the four-step PSP. Our mathematical model demonstrates that by summing successive motion-affected phase frames weighted by binomial coefficients, motion error exponentially diminishes as the binomial order increases, accomplishing automatic error compensation through the motion-affected phase sequence, without the assistance of any intermediate variable. Extensive experiments show that our BSC outperforms the existing methods in reducing motion error, while achieving a depth map frame rate equal to the camera's acquisition rate (90 fps), enabling high-accuracy 3D reconstruction with a quasi-single-shot frame rate.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of Multi-Camera 3D Object Detection (MC3D-Det), facilitated by bird's-eye view (BEV) representation, signifies a notable progression in 3D object detection. Scaling MC3D-Det training effectively accommodates varied camera parameters and urban landscapes, paving the way for the MC3D-Det foundation model. However, the multi-view fusion stage of the MC3D-Det method relies on the ill-posed monocular perception during training rather than surround refinement ability, leading to what we term "surround refinement degradation". To this end, our study presents a weak-to-strong eliciting framework aimed at enhancing surround refinement while maintaining robust monocular perception. Specifically, our framework employs weakly tuned experts trained on distinct subsets, and each is inherently biased toward specific camera configurations and scenarios. These biased experts can learn the perception of monocular degeneration, which can help the multi-view fusion stage to enhance surround refinement abilities. Moreover, a composite distillation strategy is proposed to integrate the universal knowledge of 2D foundation models and task-specific information. Finally, for MC3D-Det joint training, the elaborate dataset merge strategy is designed to solve the problem of inconsistent camera numbers and camera parameters. We set up a multiple dataset joint training benchmark for MC3D-Det and adequately evaluated existing methods. Further, we demonstrate the proposed framework brings a generalized and significant boost over multiple baselines. Our code is at \url{https://github.com/EnVision-Research/Scale-BEV}.</description>

      <title>Convolution-based Probability Gradient Loss for Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel Convolution-based Probability Gradient (CPG) loss for semantic segmentation. It employs convolution kernels similar to the Sobel operator, capable of computing the gradient of pixel intensity in an image. This enables the computation of gradients for both ground-truth and predicted category-wise probabilities. It enhances network performance by maximizing the similarity between these two probability gradients. Moreover, to specifically enhance accuracy near the object's boundary, we extract the object boundary based on the ground-truth probability gradient and exclusively apply the CPG loss to pixels belonging to boundaries. CPG loss proves to be highly convenient and effective. It establishes pixel relationships through convolution, calculating errors from a distinct dimension compared to pixel-wise loss functions such as cross-entropy loss. We conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses to evaluate the impact of the CPG loss on three well-established networks (DeepLabv3-Resnet50, HRNetV2-OCR, and LRASPP_MobileNet_V3_Large) across three standard segmentation datasets (Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff, ADE20K). Our extensive experimental results consistently and significantly demonstrate that the CPG loss enhances the mean Intersection over Union.</description>

      <title>SpikeNVS: Enhancing Novel View Synthesis from Blurry Images via Spike Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most critical factors in achieving sharp Novel View Synthesis (NVS) using neural field methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is the quality of the training images. However, Conventional RGB cameras are susceptible to motion blur. In contrast, neuromorphic cameras like event and spike cameras inherently capture more comprehensive temporal information, which can provide a sharp representation of the scene as additional training data. Recent methods have explored the integration of event cameras to improve the quality of NVS. The event-RGB approaches have some limitations, such as high training costs and the inability to work effectively in the background. Instead, our study introduces a new method that uses the spike camera to overcome these limitations. By considering texture reconstruction from spike streams as ground truth, we design the Texture from Spike (TfS) loss. Since the spike camera relies on temporal integration instead of temporal differentiation used by event cameras, our proposed TfS loss maintains manageable training costs. It handles foreground objects with backgrounds simultaneously. We also provide a real-world dataset captured with our spike-RGB camera system to facilitate future research endeavors. We conduct extensive experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that our design can enhance novel view synthesis across NeRF and 3DGS. The code and dataset will be made available for public access.</description>

      <title>Sparse Points to Dense Clouds: Enhancing 3D Detection with Limited LiDAR Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D detection is a critical task that enables machines to identify and locate objects in three-dimensional space. It has a broad range of applications in several fields, including autonomous driving, robotics and augmented reality. Monocular 3D detection is attractive as it requires only a single camera, however, it lacks the accuracy and robustness required for real world applications. High resolution LiDAR on the other hand, can be expensive and lead to interference problems in heavy traffic given their active transmissions. We propose a balanced approach that combines the advantages of monocular and point cloud-based 3D detection. Our method requires only a small number of 3D points, that can be obtained from a low-cost, low-resolution sensor. Specifically, we use only 512 points, which is just 1% of a full LiDAR frame in the KITTI dataset. Our method reconstructs a complete 3D point cloud from this limited 3D information combined with a single image. The reconstructed 3D point cloud and corresponding image can be used by any multi-modal off-the-shelf detector for 3D object detection. By using the proposed network architecture with an off-the-shelf multi-modal 3D detector, the accuracy of 3D detection improves by 20% compared to the state-of-the-art monocular detection methods and 6% to 9% compare to the baseline multi-modal methods on KITTI and JackRabbot datasets.</description>

      <title>Bayesian NeRF: Quantifying Uncertainty with Volume Density in Neural Radiance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Bayesian Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), which explicitly quantifies uncertainty in geometric volume structures without the need for additional networks, making it adept for challenging observations and uncontrolled images. NeRF diverges from traditional geometric methods by offering an enriched scene representation, rendering color and density in 3D space from various viewpoints. However, NeRF encounters limitations in relaxing uncertainties by using geometric structure information, leading to inaccuracies in interpretation under insufficient real-world observations. Recent research efforts aimed at addressing this issue have primarily relied on empirical methods or auxiliary networks. To fundamentally address this issue, we propose a series of formulational extensions to NeRF. By introducing generalized approximations and defining density-related uncertainty, our method seamlessly extends to manage uncertainty not only for RGB but also for depth, without the need for additional networks or empirical assumptions. In experiments we show that our method significantly enhances performance on RGB and depth images in the comprehensive dataset, demonstrating the reliability of the Bayesian NeRF approach to quantifying uncertainty based on the geometric structure.</description>

      <title>An Animation-based Augmentation Approach for Action Recognition from Discontinuous Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of action recognition has attracted considerable attention recently due to its broad applications in multiple areas. However, with the issue of discontinuous training video, which not only decreases the performance of action recognition model, but complicates the data augmentation process as well, still remains under-exploration. In this study, we introduce the 4A (Action Animation-based Augmentation Approach), an innovative pipeline for data augmentation to address the problem. The main contributions remain in our work includes: (1) we investigate the problem of severe decrease on performance of action recognition task training by discontinuous video, and the limitation of existing augmentation methods on solving this problem. (2) we propose a novel augmentation pipeline, 4A, to address the problem of discontinuous video for training, while achieving a smoother and natural-looking action representation than the latest data augmentation methodology. (3) We achieve the same performance with only 10% of the original data for training as with all of the original data from the real-world dataset, and a better performance on In-the-wild videos, by employing our data augmentation techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ocean eddies play a significant role both on the sea surface and beneath it, contributing to the sustainability of marine life dependent on oceanic behaviors. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate ocean eddies to monitor changes in the Earth, particularly in the oceans, and their impact on climate. This study aims to pinpoint ocean eddies using AWS cloud services, specifically SageMaker. The primary objective is to detect small-scale (&lt;20km) ocean eddies from satellite remote images and assess the feasibility of utilizing SageMaker, which offers tools for deploying AI applications. Moreover, this research not only explores the deployment of cloud-based services for remote sensing of Earth data but also evaluates several YOLO (You Only Look Once) models using single and multi-GPU-based services in the cloud. Furthermore, this study underscores the potential of these services, their limitations, challenges related to deployment and resource management, and their user-riendliness for Earth science projects.</description>

      <title>MonoSelfRecon: Purely Self-Supervised Explicit Generalizable 3D Reconstruction of Indoor Scenes from Monocular RGB Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current monocular 3D scene reconstruction (3DR) works are either fully-supervised, or not generalizable, or implicit in 3D representation. We propose a novel framework - MonoSelfRecon that for the first time achieves explicit 3D mesh reconstruction for generalizable indoor scenes with monocular RGB views by purely self-supervision on voxel-SDF (signed distance function). MonoSelfRecon follows an Autoencoder-based architecture, decodes voxel-SDF and a generalizable Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), which is used to guide voxel-SDF in self-supervision. We propose novel self-supervised losses, which not only support pure self-supervision, but can be used together with supervised signals to further boost supervised training. Our experiments show that "MonoSelfRecon" trained in pure self-supervision outperforms current best self-supervised indoor depth estimation models and is comparable to 3DR models trained in fully supervision with depth annotations. MonoSelfRecon is not restricted by specific model design, which can be used to any models with voxel-SDF for purely self-supervised manner.</description>

      <title>Adapting LLaMA Decoder to Vision Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines whether decoder-only Transformers such as LLaMA, which were originally designed for large language models (LLMs), can be adapted to the computer vision field. We first "LLaMAfy" a standard ViT step-by-step to align with LLaMA's architecture, and find that directly applying a casual mask to the self-attention brings an attention collapse issue, resulting in the failure to the network training. We suggest to reposition the class token behind the image tokens with a post-sequence class token technique to overcome this challenge, enabling causal self-attention to efficiently capture the entire image's information. Additionally, we develop a soft mask strategy that gradually introduces a casual mask to the self-attention at the onset of training to facilitate the optimization behavior. The tailored model, dubbed as image LLaMA (iLLaMA), is akin to LLaMA in architecture and enables direct supervised learning. Its causal self-attention boosts computational efficiency and learns complex representation by elevating attention map ranks. iLLaMA rivals the performance with its encoder-only counterparts, achieving 75.1% ImageNet top-1 accuracy with only 5.7M parameters. Scaling the model to ~310M and pre-training on ImageNet-21K further enhances the accuracy to 86.0%. Extensive experiments demonstrate iLLaMA's reliable properties: calibration, shape-texture bias, quantization compatibility, ADE20K segmentation and CIFAR transfer learning. We hope our study can kindle fresh views to visual model design in the wave of LLMs. Pre-trained models and codes are available here.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Scalable Chinese Vector Font Generation via Component Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chinese vector font generation is challenging due to the complex structure and huge amount of Chinese characters. Recent advances remain limited to generating a small set of characters with simple structure. In this work, we first observe that most Chinese characters can be disassembled into frequently-reused components. Therefore, we introduce the first efficient and scalable Chinese vector font generation approach via component composition, allowing generating numerous vector characters from a small set of components. To achieve this, we collect a large-scale dataset that contains over \textit{90K} Chinese characters with their components and layout information. Upon the dataset, we propose a simple yet effective framework based on spatial transformer networks (STN) and multiple losses tailored to font characteristics to learn the affine transformation of the components, which can be directly applied to the B\'ezier curves, resulting in Chinese characters in vector format. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments have demonstrated that our method significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art vector font generation methods in generating large-scale complex Chinese characters in both font generation and zero-shot font extension.</description>

      <title>Urban Architect: Steerable 3D Urban Scene Generation with Layout Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-3D generation has achieved remarkable success via large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. Nevertheless, there is no paradigm for scaling up the methodology to urban scale. Urban scenes, characterized by numerous elements, intricate arrangement relationships, and vast scale, present a formidable barrier to the interpretability of ambiguous textual descriptions for effective model optimization. In this work, we surmount the limitations by introducing a compositional 3D layout representation into text-to-3D paradigm, serving as an additional prior. It comprises a set of semantic primitives with simple geometric structures and explicit arrangement relationships, complementing textual descriptions and enabling steerable generation. Upon this, we propose two modifications -- (1) We introduce Layout-Guided Variational Score Distillation to address model optimization inadequacies. It conditions the score distillation sampling process with geometric and semantic constraints of 3D layouts. (2) To handle the unbounded nature of urban scenes, we represent 3D scene with a Scalable Hash Grid structure, incrementally adapting to the growing scale of urban scenes. Extensive experiments substantiate the capability of our framework to scale text-to-3D generation to large-scale urban scenes that cover over 1000m driving distance for the first time. We also present various scene editing demonstrations, showing the powers of steerable urban scene generation. Website: https://urbanarchitect.github.io.</description>

      <title>MedRG: Medical Report Grounding with Multi-modal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical Report Grounding is pivotal in identifying the most relevant regions in medical images based on a given phrase query, a critical aspect in medical image analysis and radiological diagnosis. However, prevailing visual grounding approaches necessitate the manual extraction of key phrases from medical reports, imposing substantial burdens on both system efficiency and physicians. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, Medical Report Grounding (MedRG), an end-to-end solution for utilizing a multi-modal Large Language Model to predict key phrase by incorporating a unique token, BOX, into the vocabulary to serve as an embedding for unlocking detection capabilities. Subsequently, the vision encoder-decoder jointly decodes the hidden embedding and the input medical image, generating the corresponding grounding box. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of MedRG, surpassing the performance of the existing state-of-the-art medical phrase grounding methods. This study represents a pioneering exploration of the medical report grounding task, marking the first-ever endeavor in this domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D point cloud completion is designed to recover complete shapes from partially observed point clouds. Conventional completion methods typically depend on extensive point cloud data for training %, with their effectiveness often constrained to object categories similar to those seen during training. In contrast, we propose a zero-shot framework aimed at completing partially observed point clouds across any unseen categories. Leveraging point rendering via Gaussian Splatting, we develop techniques of Point Cloud Colorization and Zero-shot Fractal Completion that utilize 2D priors from pre-trained diffusion models to infer missing regions. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world scanned point clouds demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in completing a variety of objects without any requirement for specific training data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting anomalies in images has become a well-explored problem in both academia and industry. State-of-the-art algorithms are able to detect defects in increasingly difficult settings and data modalities. However, most current methods are not suited to address 3D objects captured from differing poses. While solutions using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have been proposed, they suffer from excessive computation requirements, which hinder real-world usability. For this reason, we propose the novel 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework SplatPose which, given multi-view images of a 3D object, accurately estimates the pose of unseen views in a differentiable manner, and detects anomalies in them. We achieve state-of-the-art results in both training and inference speed, and detection performance, even when using less training data than competing methods. We thoroughly evaluate our framework using the recently proposed Pose-agnostic Anomaly Detection benchmark and its multi-pose anomaly detection (MAD) data set.</description>

      <title>Tuning-Free Adaptive Style Incorporation for Structure-Consistent Text-Driven Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we target the task of text-driven style transfer in the context of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The main challenge is consistent structure preservation while enabling effective style transfer effects. The past approaches in this field directly concatenate the content and style prompts for a prompt-level style injection, leading to unavoidable structure distortions. In this work, we propose a novel solution to the text-driven style transfer task, namely, Adaptive Style Incorporation~(ASI), to achieve fine-grained feature-level style incorporation. It consists of the Siamese Cross-Attention~(SiCA) to decouple the single-track cross-attention to a dual-track structure to obtain separate content and style features, and the Adaptive Content-Style Blending (AdaBlending) module to couple the content and style information from a structure-consistent manner. Experimentally, our method exhibits much better performance in both structure preservation and stylized effects.</description>

      <title>O2V-Mapping: Online Open-Vocabulary Mapping with Neural Implicit Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online construction of open-ended language scenes is crucial for robotic applications, where open-vocabulary interactive scene understanding is required. Recently, neural implicit representation has provided a promising direction for online interactive mapping. However, implementing open-vocabulary scene understanding capability into online neural implicit mapping still faces three challenges: lack of local scene updating ability, blurry spatial hierarchical semantic segmentation and difficulty in maintaining multi-view consistency. To this end, we proposed O2V-mapping, which utilizes voxel-based language and geometric features to create an open-vocabulary field, thus allowing for local updates during online training process. Additionally, we leverage a foundational model for image segmentation to extract language features on object-level entities, achieving clear segmentation boundaries and hierarchical semantic features. For the purpose of preserving consistency in 3D object properties across different viewpoints, we propose a spatial adaptive voxel adjustment mechanism and a multi-view weight selection method. Extensive experiments on open-vocabulary object localization and semantic segmentation demonstrate that O2V-mapping achieves online construction of language scenes while enhancing accuracy, outperforming the previous SOTA method.</description>

      <title>MoCha-Stereo: Motif Channel Attention Network for Stereo Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based stereo matching techniques have made significant progress. However, existing methods inevitably lose geometrical structure information during the feature channel generation process, resulting in edge detail mismatches. In this paper, the Motif Cha}nnel Attention Stereo Matching Network (MoCha-Stereo) is designed to address this problem. We provide the Motif Channel Correlation Volume (MCCV) to determine more accurate edge matching costs. MCCV is achieved by projecting motif channels, which capture common geometric structures in feature channels, onto feature maps and cost volumes. In addition, edge variations in %potential feature channels of the reconstruction error map also affect details matching, we propose the Reconstruction Error Motif Penalty (REMP) module to further refine the full-resolution disparity estimation. REMP integrates the frequency information of typical channel features from the reconstruction error. MoCha-Stereo ranks 1st on the KITTI-2015 and KITTI-2012 Reflective leaderboards. Our structure also shows excellent performance in Multi-View Stereo. Code is avaliable at https://github.com/ZYangChen/MoCha-Stereo.</description>

      <title>UDiFF: Generating Conditional Unsigned Distance Fields with Optimal Wavelet Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable results for image generation, editing and inpainting. Recent works explore diffusion models for 3D shape generation with neural implicit functions, i.e., signed distance function and occupancy function. However, they are limited to shapes with closed surfaces, which prevents them from generating diverse 3D real-world contents containing open surfaces. In this work, we present UDiFF, a 3D diffusion model for unsigned distance fields (UDFs) which is capable to generate textured 3D shapes with open surfaces from text conditions or unconditionally. Our key idea is to generate UDFs in spatial-frequency domain with an optimal wavelet transformation, which produces a compact representation space for UDF generation. Specifically, instead of selecting an appropriate wavelet transformation which requires expensive manual efforts and still leads to large information loss, we propose a data-driven approach to learn the optimal wavelet transformation for UDFs. We evaluate UDiFF to show our advantages by numerical and visual comparisons with the latest methods on widely used benchmarks. Page: https://weiqi-zhang.github.io/UDiFF.</description>

      <title>Multi-Label Continual Learning for the Medical Domain: A Novel Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-label image classification in dynamic environments is a problem that poses significant challenges. Previous studies have primarily focused on scenarios such as Domain Incremental Learning and Class Incremental Learning, which do not fully capture the complexity of real-world applications. In this paper, we study the problem of classification of medical imaging in the scenario termed New Instances \&amp; New Classes, which combines the challenges of both new class arrivals and domain shifts in a single framework. Unlike traditional scenarios, it reflects the realistic nature of CL in domains such as medical imaging, where updates may introduce both new classes and changes in domain characteristics. To address the unique challenges posed by this complex scenario, we introduce a novel approach called Pseudo-Label Replay. This method aims to mitigate forgetting while adapting to new classes and domain shifts by combining the advantages of the Replay and Pseudo-Label methods and solving their limitations in the proposed scenario. % part3 We evaluate our proposed approach on a challenging benchmark consisting of two datasets, seven tasks, and nineteen classes, modeling a realistic Continual Learning scenario. Our experimental findings demonstrate the effectiveness of Pseudo-Label Replay in addressing the challenges posed by the complex scenario proposed. Our method surpasses existing approaches, exhibiting superior performance while showing minimal forgetting.</description>

      <title>Monocular 3D lane detection for Autonomous Driving: Recent Achievements, Challenges, and Outlooks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D lane detection plays a crucial role in autonomous driving by extracting structural and traffic information from the road in 3D space to assist the self-driving car in rational, safe, and comfortable path planning and motion control. Due to the consideration of sensor costs and the advantages of visual data in color information, in practical applications, 3D lane detection based on monocular vision is one of the important research directions in the field of autonomous driving, which has attracted more and more attention in both industry and academia. Unfortunately, recent progress in visual perception seems insufficient to develop completely reliable 3D lane detection algorithms, which also hinders the development of vision-based fully autonomous self-driving cars, i.e., achieving level 5 autonomous driving, driving like human-controlled cars. This is one of the conclusions drawn from this review paper: there is still a lot of room for improvement and significant improvements are still needed in the 3D lane detection algorithm for autonomous driving cars using visual sensors. Motivated by this, this review defines, analyzes, and reviews the current achievements in the field of 3D lane detection research, and the vast majority of the current progress relies heavily on computationally complex deep learning models. In addition, this review covers the 3D lane detection pipeline, investigates the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms, analyzes the time complexity of cutting-edge modeling choices, and highlights the main achievements and limitations of current research efforts. The survey also includes a comprehensive discussion of available 3D lane detection datasets and the challenges that researchers have faced but have not yet resolved. Finally, our work outlines future research directions and welcomes researchers and practitioners to enter this exciting field.</description>

      <title>RESSCAL3D: Resolution Scalable 3D Semantic Segmentation of Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated outstanding results in numerous domains, some important functionalities are missing. Resolution scalability is one of them. In this work, we introduce a novel architecture, dubbed RESSCAL3D, providing resolution-scalable 3D semantic segmentation of point clouds. In contrast to existing works, the proposed method does not require the whole point cloud to be available to start inference. Once a low-resolution version of the input point cloud is available, first semantic predictions can be generated in an extremely fast manner. This enables early decision-making in subsequent processing steps. As additional points become available, these are processed in parallel. To improve performance, features from previously computed scales are employed as prior knowledge at the current scale. Our experiments show that RESSCAL3D is 31-62% faster than the non-scalable baseline while keeping a limited impact on performance. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first to propose a resolution-scalable approach for 3D semantic segmentation of point clouds based on deep learning.</description>

      <title>Fine color guidance in diffusion models and its application to image compression at extremely low bitrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of, without training or fine-tuning, controlling the global color aspect of images generated with a diffusion model. We rewrite the guidance equations to ensure that the outputs are closer to a known color map, and this without hindering the quality of the generation. Our method leads to new guidance equations. We show in the color guidance context that, the scaling of the guidance should not decrease but remains high throughout the diffusion process. In a second contribution, our guidance is applied in a compression framework, we combine both semantic and general color information on the image to decode the images at low cost. We show that our method is effective at improving fidelity and realism of compressed images at extremely low bit rates, when compared to other classical or more semantic oriented approaches.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology, AI-enabled image recognition has emerged as a potent tool for addressing challenges in traditional environmental monitoring. This study focuses on the detection of floating objects in river and lake environments, exploring an innovative approach based on deep learning. By intricately analyzing the technical pathways for detecting static and dynamic features and considering the characteristics of river and lake debris, a comprehensive image acquisition and processing workflow has been developed. The study highlights the application and performance comparison of three mainstream deep learning models -SSD, Faster-RCNN, and YOLOv5- in debris identification. Additionally, a detection system for floating objects has been designed and implemented, encompassing both hardware platform construction and software framework development. Through rigorous experimental validation, the proposed system has demonstrated its ability to significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of debris detection, thus offering a new technological avenue for water quality monitoring in rivers and lakes</description>

      <title>SparseAD: Sparse Query-Centric Paradigm for Efficient End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-End paradigms use a unified framework to implement multi-tasks in an autonomous driving system. Despite simplicity and clarity, the performance of end-to-end autonomous driving methods on sub-tasks is still far behind the single-task methods. Meanwhile, the widely used dense BEV features in previous end-to-end methods make it costly to extend to more modalities or tasks. In this paper, we propose a Sparse query-centric paradigm for end-to-end Autonomous Driving (SparseAD), where the sparse queries completely represent the whole driving scenario across space, time and tasks without any dense BEV representation. Concretely, we design a unified sparse architecture for perception tasks including detection, tracking, and online mapping. Moreover, we revisit motion prediction and planning, and devise a more justifiable motion planner framework. On the challenging nuScenes dataset, SparseAD achieves SOTA full-task performance among end-to-end methods and significantly narrows the performance gap between end-to-end paradigms and single-task methods. Codes will be released soon.</description>

      <title>O-TALC: Steps Towards Combating Oversegmentation within Online Action Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online temporal action segmentation shows a strong potential to facilitate many HRI tasks where extended human action sequences must be tracked and understood in real time. Traditional action segmentation approaches, however, operate in an offline two stage approach, relying on computationally expensive video wide features for segmentation, rendering them unsuitable for online HRI applications. In order to facilitate online action segmentation on a stream of incoming video data, we introduce two methods for improved training and inference of backbone action recognition models, allowing them to be deployed directly for online frame level classification. Firstly, we introduce surround dense sampling whilst training to facilitate training vs. inference clip matching and improve segment boundary predictions. Secondly, we introduce an Online Temporally Aware Label Cleaning (O-TALC) strategy to explicitly reduce oversegmentation during online inference. As our methods are backbone invariant, they can be deployed with computationally efficient spatio-temporal action recognition models capable of operating in real time with a small segmentation latency. We show our method outperforms similar online action segmentation work as well as matches the performance of many offline models with access to full temporal resolution when operating on challenging fine-grained datasets.</description>

      <title>DreamScene360: Unconstrained Text-to-3D Scene Generation with Panoramic Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for virtual reality applications has highlighted the significance of crafting immersive 3D assets. We present a text-to-3D 360$^{\circ}$ scene generation pipeline that facilitates the creation of comprehensive 360$^{\circ}$ scenes for in-the-wild environments in a matter of minutes. Our approach utilizes the generative power of a 2D diffusion model and prompt self-refinement to create a high-quality and globally coherent panoramic image. This image acts as a preliminary "flat" (2D) scene representation. Subsequently, it is lifted into 3D Gaussians, employing splatting techniques to enable real-time exploration. To produce consistent 3D geometry, our pipeline constructs a spatially coherent structure by aligning the 2D monocular depth into a globally optimized point cloud. This point cloud serves as the initial state for the centroids of 3D Gaussians. In order to address invisible issues inherent in single-view inputs, we impose semantic and geometric constraints on both synthesized and input camera views as regularizations. These guide the optimization of Gaussians, aiding in the reconstruction of unseen regions. In summary, our method offers a globally consistent 3D scene within a 360$^{\circ}$ perspective, providing an enhanced immersive experience over existing techniques.

      <title>Sparse Global Matching for Video Frame Interpolation with Large Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large motion poses a critical challenge in Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) task. Existing methods are often constrained by limited receptive fields, resulting in sub-optimal performance when handling scenarios with large motion. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline for VFI, which can effectively integrate global-level information to alleviate issues associated with large motion. Specifically, we first estimate a pair of initial intermediate flows using a high-resolution feature map for extracting local details. Then, we incorporate a sparse global matching branch to compensate for flow estimation, which consists of identifying flaws in initial flows and generating sparse flow compensation with a global receptive field. Finally, we adaptively merge the initial flow estimation with global flow compensation, yielding a more accurate intermediate flow. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method in handling large motion, we carefully curate a more challenging subset from commonly used benchmarks. Our method demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on these VFI subsets with large motion.</description>

      <title>HRVDA: High-Resolution Visual Document Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging vast training data, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated formidable general visual comprehension capabilities and achieved remarkable performance across various tasks. However, their performance in visual document understanding still leaves much room for improvement. This discrepancy is primarily attributed to the fact that visual document understanding is a fine-grained prediction task. In natural scenes, MLLMs typically use low-resolution images, leading to a substantial loss of visual information. Furthermore, general-purpose MLLMs do not excel in handling document-oriented instructions. In this paper, we propose a High-Resolution Visual Document Assistant (HRVDA), which bridges the gap between MLLMs and visual document understanding. This model employs a content filtering mechanism and an instruction filtering module to separately filter out the content-agnostic visual tokens and instruction-agnostic visual tokens, thereby achieving efficient model training and inference for high-resolution images. In addition, we construct a document-oriented visual instruction tuning dataset and apply a multi-stage training strategy to enhance the model's document modeling capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple document understanding datasets, while maintaining training efficiency and inference speed comparable to low-resolution models.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Generic Point Model for Lossless Point Cloud Attribute Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The past several years have witnessed the emergence of learned point cloud compression (PCC) techniques. However, current learning-based lossless point cloud attribute compression (PCAC) methods either suffer from high computational complexity or deteriorated compression performance. Moreover, the significant variations in point cloud scale and sparsity encountered in real-world applications make developing an all-in-one neural model a challenging task. In this paper, we propose PoLoPCAC, an efficient and generic lossless PCAC method that achieves high compression efficiency and strong generalizability simultaneously. We formulate lossless PCAC as the task of inferring explicit distributions of attributes from group-wise autoregressive priors. A progressive random grouping strategy is first devised to efficiently resolve the point cloud into groups, and then the attributes of each group are modeled sequentially from accumulated antecedents. A locality-aware attention mechanism is utilized to exploit prior knowledge from context windows in parallel. Since our method directly operates on points, it can naturally avoids distortion caused by voxelization, and can be executed on point clouds with arbitrary scale and density. Experiments show that our method can be instantly deployed once trained on a Synthetic 2k-ShapeNet dataset while enjoying continuous bit-rate reduction over the latest G-PCCv23 on various datasets (ShapeNet, ScanNet, MVUB, 8iVFB). Meanwhile, our method reports shorter coding time than G-PCCv23 on the majority of sequences with a lightweight model size (2.6MB), which is highly attractive for practical applications. Dataset, code and trained model are available at https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/PoLoPCAC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the area of adversarial attacks on image quality metrics has begun to be explored, whereas the area of defences remains under-researched. In this study, we aim to cover that case and check the transferability of adversarial purification defences from image classifiers to IQA methods. In this paper, we apply several widespread attacks on IQA models and examine the success of the defences against them. The purification methodologies covered different preprocessing techniques, including geometrical transformations, compression, denoising, and modern neural network-based methods. Also, we address the challenge of assessing the efficacy of a defensive methodology by proposing ways to estimate output visual quality and the success of neutralizing attacks. Defences were tested against attack on three IQA metrics -- Linearity, MetaIQA and SPAQ. The code for attacks and defences is available at: (link is hidden for a blind review).</description>

      <title>V-MAD: Video-based Morphing Attack Detection in Operational Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to the rising threat of the face morphing attack, this paper introduces and explores the potential of Video-based Morphing Attack Detection (V-MAD) systems in real-world operational scenarios. While current morphing attack detection methods primarily focus on a single or a pair of images, V-MAD is based on video sequences, exploiting the video streams often acquired by face verification tools available, for instance, at airport gates. Through this study, we show for the first time the advantages that the availability of multiple probe frames can bring to the morphing attack detection task, especially in scenarios where the quality of probe images is varied and might be affected, for instance, by pose or illumination variations. Experimental results on a real operational database demonstrate that video sequences represent valuable information for increasing the robustness and performance of morphing attack detection systems.</description>

      <title>TrajPRed: Trajectory Prediction with Region-based Relation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting human trajectories in traffic scenes is critical for safety within mixed or fully autonomous systems. Human future trajectories are driven by two major stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals. Thus, reliable forecasting needs to capture these two stimuli. Edge-based relation modeling represents social interactions using pairwise correlations from precise individual states. Nevertheless, edge-based relations can be vulnerable under perturbations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a region-based relation learning paradigm that models social interactions via region-wise dynamics of joint states, i.e., the changes in the density of crowds. In particular, region-wise agent joint information is encoded within convolutional feature grids. Social relations are modeled by relating the temporal changes of local joint information from a global perspective. We show that region-based relations are less susceptible to perturbations. In order to account for the stochastic individual goals, we exploit a conditional variational autoencoder to realize multi-goal estimation and diverse future prediction. Specifically, we perform variational inference via the latent distribution, which is conditioned on the correlation between input states and associated target goals. Sampling from the latent distribution enables the framework to reliably capture the stochastic behavior in test data. We integrate multi-goal estimation and region-based relation learning to model the two stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals, in a prediction framework. We evaluate our framework on the ETH-UCY dataset and Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). We show that the diverse prediction better fits the ground truth when incorporating the relation module.

      <title>Accurate Tennis Court Line Detection on Amateur Recorded Matches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typically, tennis court line detection is done by running Hough-Line-Detection to find straight lines in the image, and then computing a transformation matrix from the detected lines to create the final court structure. We propose numerous improvements and enhancements to this algorithm, including using pretrained State-of-the-Art shadow-removal and object-detection ML models to make our line-detection more robust. Compared to the original algorithm, our method can accurately detect lines on amateur, dirty courts. When combined with a robust ball-tracking system, our method will enable accurate, automatic refereeing for amateur and professional tennis matches alike.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based inpainting of incomplete Euclidean distance matrices of trajectories generated by a fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional Brownian trajectories (fBm) feature both randomness and strong scale-free correlations, challenging generative models to reproduce the intrinsic memory characterizing the underlying process. Here we test a diffusion probabilistic model on a specific dataset of corrupted images corresponding to incomplete Euclidean distance matrices of fBm at various memory exponents $H$. Our dataset implies uniqueness of the data imputation in the regime of low missing ratio, where the remaining partial graph is rigid, providing the ground truth for the inpainting. We find that the conditional diffusion generation stably reproduces the statistics of missing fBm-distributed distances for different values of $H$ exponent. Furthermore, while diffusion models have been recently shown to remember samples from the training database, we show that diffusion-based inpainting behaves qualitatively different from the database search with the increasing database size. Finally, we apply our fBm-trained diffusion model with $H=1/3$ for completion of chromosome distance matrices obtained in single-cell microscopy experiments, showing its superiority over the standard bioinformatics algorithms.

      <title>ORacle: Large Vision-Language Models for Knowledge-Guided Holistic OR Domain Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every day, countless surgeries are performed worldwide, each within the distinct settings of operating rooms (ORs) that vary not only in their setups but also in the personnel, tools, and equipment used. This inherent diversity poses a substantial challenge for achieving a holistic understanding of the OR, as it requires models to generalize beyond their initial training datasets. To reduce this gap, we introduce ORacle, an advanced vision-language model designed for holistic OR domain modeling, which incorporates multi-view and temporal capabilities and can leverage external knowledge during inference, enabling it to adapt to previously unseen surgical scenarios. This capability is further enhanced by our novel data augmentation framework, which significantly diversifies the training dataset, ensuring ORacle's proficiency in applying the provided knowledge effectively. In rigorous testing, in scene graph generation, and downstream tasks on the 4D-OR dataset, ORacle not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performance but does so requiring less data than existing models. Furthermore, its adaptability is displayed through its ability to interpret unseen views, actions, and appearances of tools and equipment. This demonstrates ORacle's potential to significantly enhance the scalability and affordability of OR domain modeling and opens a pathway for future advancements in surgical data science. We will release our code and data upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>An Evidential-enhanced Tri-Branch Consistency Learning Method for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised segmentation presents a promising approach for large-scale medical image analysis, effectively reducing annotation burdens while achieving comparable performance. This methodology holds substantial potential for streamlining the segmentation process and enhancing its feasibility within clinical settings for translational investigations. While cross-supervised training, based on distinct co-training sub-networks, has become a prevalent paradigm for this task, addressing critical issues such as predication disagreement and label-noise suppression requires further attention and progress in cross-supervised training. In this paper, we introduce an Evidential Tri-Branch Consistency learning framework (ETC-Net) for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. ETC-Net employs three branches: an evidential conservative branch, an evidential progressive branch, and an evidential fusion branch. The first two branches exhibit complementary characteristics, allowing them to address prediction diversity and enhance training stability. We also integrate uncertainty estimation from the evidential learning into cross-supervised training, mitigating the negative impact of erroneous supervision signals. Additionally, the evidential fusion branch capitalizes on the complementary attributes of the first two branches and leverages an evidence-based Dempster-Shafer fusion strategy, supervised by more reliable and accurate pseudo-labels of unlabeled data. Extensive experiments conducted on LA, Pancreas-CT, and ACDC datasets demonstrate that ETC-Net surpasses other state-of-the-art methods for semi-supervised segmentation. The code will be made available in the near future at https://github.com/Medsemiseg.</description>

      <title>Identification of Fine-grained Systematic Errors via Controlled Scene Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many safety-critical applications, especially in autonomous driving, require reliable object detectors. They can be very effectively assisted by a method to search for and identify potential failures and systematic errors before these detectors are deployed. Systematic errors are characterized by combinations of attributes such as object location, scale, orientation, and color, as well as the composition of their respective backgrounds. To identify them, one must rely on something other than real images from a test set because they do not account for very rare but possible combinations of attributes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a pipeline for generating realistic synthetic scenes with fine-grained control, allowing the creation of complex scenes with multiple objects. Our approach, BEV2EGO, allows for a realistic generation of the complete scene with road-contingent control that maps 2D bird's-eye view (BEV) scene configurations to a first-person view (EGO). In addition, we propose a benchmark for controlled scene generation to select the most appropriate generative outpainting model for BEV2EGO. We further use it to perform a systematic analysis of multiple state-of-the-art object detection models and discover differences between them.</description>

      <title>Implicit Multi-Spectral Transformer: An Lightweight and Effective Visible to Infrared Image Translation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of computer vision, visible light images often exhibit low contrast in low-light conditions, presenting a significant challenge. While infrared imagery provides a potential solution, its utilization entails high costs and practical limitations. Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly the deployment of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have facilitated the transformation of visible light images to infrared images. However, these methods often experience unstable training phases and may produce suboptimal outputs. To address these issues, we propose a novel end-to-end Transformer-based model that efficiently converts visible light images into high-fidelity infrared images. Initially, the Texture Mapping Module and Color Perception Adapter collaborate to extract texture and color features from the visible light image. The Dynamic Fusion Aggregation Module subsequently integrates these features. Finally, the transformation into an infrared image is refined through the synergistic action of the Color Perception Adapter and the Enhanced Perception Attention mechanism. Comprehensive benchmarking experiments confirm that our model outperforms existing methods, producing infrared images of markedly superior quality, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, the proposed model enables more effective downstream applications for infrared images than other methods.</description>

      <title>VLLMs Provide Better Context for Emotion Understanding Through Common Sense Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognising emotions in context involves identifying the apparent emotions of an individual, taking into account contextual cues from the surrounding scene. Previous approaches to this task have involved the design of explicit scene-encoding architectures or the incorporation of external scene-related information, such as captions. However, these methods often utilise limited contextual information or rely on intricate training pipelines. In this work, we leverage the groundbreaking capabilities of Vision-and-Large-Language Models (VLLMs) to enhance in-context emotion classification without introducing complexity to the training process in a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we propose prompting VLLMs to generate descriptions in natural language of the subject's apparent emotion relative to the visual context. In the second stage, the descriptions are used as contextual information and, along with the image input, are used to train a transformer-based architecture that fuses text and visual features before the final classification task. Our experimental results show that the text and image features have complementary information, and our fused architecture significantly outperforms the individual modalities without any complex training methods. We evaluate our approach on three different datasets, namely, EMOTIC, CAER-S, and BoLD, and achieve state-of-the-art or comparable accuracy across all datasets and metrics compared to much more complex approaches. The code will be made publicly available on github: https://github.com/NickyFot/EmoCommonSense.git</description>

      <title>MoCap-to-Visual Domain Adaptation for Efficient Human Mesh Estimation from 2D Keypoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Key2Mesh, a model that takes a set of 2D human pose keypoints as input and estimates the corresponding body mesh. Since this process does not involve any visual (i.e. RGB image) data, the model can be trained on large-scale motion capture (MoCap) datasets, thereby overcoming the scarcity of image datasets with 3D labels. To enable the model's application on RGB images, we first run an off-the-shelf 2D pose estimator to obtain the 2D keypoints, and then feed these 2D keypoints to Key2Mesh. To improve the performance of our model on RGB images, we apply an adversarial domain adaptation (DA) method to bridge the gap between the MoCap and visual domains. Crucially, our DA method does not require 3D labels for visual data, which enables adaptation to target sets without the need for costly labels. We evaluate Key2Mesh for the task of estimating 3D human meshes from 2D keypoints, in the absence of RGB and mesh label pairs. Our results on widely used H3.6M and 3DPW datasets show that Key2Mesh sets the new state-of-the-art by outperforming other models in PA-MPJPE for both datasets, and in MPJPE and PVE for the 3DPW dataset. Thanks to our model's simple architecture, it operates at least 12x faster than the prior state-of-the-art model, LGD. Additional qualitative samples and code are available on the project website: https://key2mesh.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Learning Priors for Non Rigid SfM from Casual Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tackle the long-standing challenge of reconstructing 3D structures and camera positions from videos. The problem is particularly hard when objects are transformed in a non-rigid way. Current approaches to this problem make unrealistic assumptions or require a long optimization time.
  We present TracksTo4D, a novel deep learning-based approach that enables inferring 3D structure and camera positions from dynamic content originating from in-the-wild videos using a single feed-forward pass on a sparse point track matrix. To achieve this, we leverage recent advances in 2D point tracking and design an equivariant neural architecture tailored for directly processing 2D point tracks by leveraging their symmetries. TracksTo4D is trained on a dataset of in-the-wild videos utilizing only the 2D point tracks extracted from the videos, without any 3D supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that TracksTo4D generalizes well to unseen videos of unseen semantic categories at inference time, producing equivalent results to state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing the runtime compared to other baselines.</description>

      <title>3DMambaComplete: Exploring Structured State Space Model for Point Cloud Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to generate a complete and high-fidelity point cloud from an initially incomplete and low-quality input. A prevalent strategy involves leveraging Transformer-based models to encode global features and facilitate the reconstruction process. However, the adoption of pooling operations to obtain global feature representations often results in the loss of local details within the point cloud. Moreover, the attention mechanism inherent in Transformers introduces additional computational complexity, rendering it challenging to handle long sequences effectively. To address these issues, we propose 3DMambaComplete, a point cloud completion network built on the novel Mamba framework. It comprises three modules: HyperPoint Generation encodes point cloud features using Mamba's selection mechanism and predicts a set of Hyperpoints. A specific offset is estimated, and the down-sampled points become HyperPoints. The HyperPoint Spread module disperses these HyperPoints across different spatial locations to avoid concentration. Finally, a deformation method transforms the 2D mesh representation of HyperPoints into a fine-grained 3D structure for point cloud reconstruction. Extensive experiments conducted on various established benchmarks demonstrate that 3DMambaComplete surpasses state-of-the-art point cloud completion methods, as confirmed by qualitative and quantitative analyses.</description>

      <title>Unfolding ADMM for Enhanced Subspace Clustering of Hyperspectral Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep subspace clustering methods are now prominent in clustering, typically using fully connected networks and a self-representation loss function. However, these methods often struggle with overfitting and lack interpretability. In this paper, we explore an alternative clustering approach based on deep unfolding. By unfolding iterative optimization methods into neural networks, this approach offers enhanced interpretability and reliability compared to data-driven deep learning methods, and greater adaptability and generalization than model-based approaches. Hence, unfolding has become widely used in inverse imaging problems, such as image restoration, reconstruction, and super-resolution, but has not been sufficiently explored yet in the context of clustering. In this work, we introduce an innovative clustering architecture for hyperspectral images (HSI) by unfolding an iterative solver based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for sparse subspace clustering. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply unfolding ADMM for computing the self-representation matrix in subspace clustering. Moreover, our approach captures well the structural characteristics of HSI data by employing the K nearest neighbors algorithm as part of a structure preservation module. Experimental evaluation of three established HSI datasets shows clearly the potential of the unfolding approach in HSI clustering and even demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to estimate a driver's points-of-gaze using a pair of ordinary cameras mounted on the windshield and dashboard of a car. This is a challenging problem due to the dynamics of traffic environments with 3D scenes of unknown depths. This problem is further complicated by the volatile distance between the driver and the camera system. To tackle these challenges, we develop a novel convolutional network that simultaneously analyzes the image of the scene and the image of the driver's face. This network has a camera calibration module that can compute an embedding vector that represents the spatial configuration between the driver and the camera system. This calibration module improves the overall network's performance, which can be jointly trained end to end.
  We also address the lack of annotated data for training and evaluation by introducing a large-scale driving dataset with point-of-gaze annotations. This is an in situ dataset of real driving sessions in an urban city, containing synchronized images of the driving scene as well as the face and gaze of the driver. Experiments on this dataset show that the proposed method outperforms various baseline methods, having the mean prediction error of 29.69 pixels, which is relatively small compared to the $1280{\times}720$ resolution of the scene camera.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel pipeline designed to bring ultrasound (US) plane pose estimation closer to clinical use for more effective navigation to the standard planes (SPs) in the fetal brain. We propose a semi-supervised segmentation model utilizing both labeled SPs and unlabeled 3D US volume slices. Our model enables reliable segmentation across a diverse set of fetal brain images. Furthermore, the model incorporates a classification mechanism to identify the fetal brain precisely. Our model not only filters out frames lacking the brain but also generates masks for those containing it, enhancing the relevance of plane pose regression in clinical settings. We focus on fetal brain navigation from 2D ultrasound (US) video analysis and combine this model with a US plane pose regression network to provide sensorless proximity detection to SPs and non-SPs planes; we emphasize the importance of proximity detection to SPs for guiding sonographers, offering a substantial advantage over traditional methods by allowing earlier and more precise adjustments during scanning. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach through validation on real fetal scan videos obtained from sonographers of varying expertise levels. Our findings demonstrate the potential of our approach to complement existing fetal US technologies and advance prenatal diagnostic practices.</description>

      <title>Lost in Translation: Modern Neural Networks Still Struggle With Small Realistic Image Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks that achieve remarkable performance in image classification have previously been shown to be easily fooled by tiny transformations such as a one pixel translation of the input image. In order to address this problem, two approaches have been proposed in recent years. The first approach suggests using huge datasets together with data augmentation in the hope that a highly varied training set will teach the network to learn to be invariant. The second approach suggests using architectural modifications based on sampling theory to deal explicitly with image translations. In this paper, we show that these approaches still fall short in robustly handling 'natural' image translations that simulate a subtle change in camera orientation. Our findings reveal that a mere one-pixel translation can result in a significant change in the predicted image representation for approximately 40% of the test images in state-of-the-art models (e.g. open-CLIP trained on LAION-2B or DINO-v2) , while models that are explicitly constructed to be robust to cyclic translations can still be fooled with 1 pixel realistic (non-cyclic) translations 11% of the time. We present Robust Inference by Crop Selection: a simple method that can be proven to achieve any desired level of consistency, although with a modest tradeoff with the model's accuracy. Importantly, we demonstrate how employing this method reduces the ability to fool state-of-the-art models with a 1 pixel translation to less than 5% while suffering from only a 1% drop in classification accuracy. Additionally, we show that our method can be easy adjusted to deal with circular shifts as well. In such case we achieve 100% robustness to integer shifts with state-of-the-art accuracy, and with no need for any further training.</description>

      <title>Unified Language-driven Zero-shot Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Unified Language-driven Zero-shot Domain Adaptation (ULDA), a novel task setting that enables a single model to adapt to diverse target domains without explicit domain-ID knowledge. We identify the constraints in the existing language-driven zero-shot domain adaptation task, particularly the requirement for domain IDs and domain-specific models, which may restrict flexibility and scalability. To overcome these issues, we propose a new framework for ULDA, consisting of Hierarchical Context Alignment (HCA), Domain Consistent Representation Learning (DCRL), and Text-Driven Rectifier (TDR). These components work synergistically to align simulated features with target text across multiple visual levels, retain semantic correlations between different regional representations, and rectify biases between simulated and real target visual features, respectively. Our extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that this framework achieves competitive performance in both settings, surpassing even the model that requires domain-ID, showcasing its superiority and generalization ability. The proposed method is not only effective but also maintains practicality and efficiency, as it does not introduce additional computational costs during inference.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular depth estimation from a single image is an ill-posed problem for computer vision due to insufficient reliable cues as the prior knowledge. Besides the inter-frame supervision, namely stereo and adjacent frames, extensive prior information is available in the same frame. Reflections from specular surfaces, informative intra-frame priors, enable us to reformulate the ill-posed depth estimation task as a multi-view synthesis. This paper proposes the first self-supervision for deep-learning depth estimation on water scenes via intra-frame priors, known as reflection supervision and geometrical constraints. In the first stage, a water segmentation network is performed to separate the reflection components from the entire image. Next, we construct a self-supervised framework to predict the target appearance from reflections, perceived as other perspectives. The photometric re-projection error, incorporating SmoothL1 and a novel photometric adaptive SSIM, is formulated to optimize pose and depth estimation by aligning the transformed virtual depths and source ones. As a supplement, the water surface is determined from real and virtual camera positions, which complement the depth of the water area. Furthermore, to alleviate these laborious ground truth annotations, we introduce a large-scale water reflection scene (WRS) dataset rendered from Unreal Engine 4. Extensive experiments on the WRS dataset prove the feasibility of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art depth estimation techniques.</description>

      <title>Move Anything with Layered Scene Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models generate images with an unprecedented level of quality, but how can we freely rearrange image layouts? Recent works generate controllable scenes via learning spatially disentangled latent codes, but these methods do not apply to diffusion models due to their fixed forward process. In this work, we propose SceneDiffusion to optimize a layered scene representation during the diffusion sampling process. Our key insight is that spatial disentanglement can be obtained by jointly denoising scene renderings at different spatial layouts. Our generated scenes support a wide range of spatial editing operations, including moving, resizing, cloning, and layer-wise appearance editing operations, including object restyling and replacing. Moreover, a scene can be generated conditioned on a reference image, thus enabling object moving for in-the-wild images. Notably, this approach is training-free, compatible with general text-to-image diffusion models, and responsive in less than a second.</description>

      <title>InstantMesh: Efficient 3D Mesh Generation from a Single Image with Sparse-view Large Reconstruction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present InstantMesh, a feed-forward framework for instant 3D mesh generation from a single image, featuring state-of-the-art generation quality and significant training scalability. By synergizing the strengths of an off-the-shelf multiview diffusion model and a sparse-view reconstruction model based on the LRM architecture, InstantMesh is able to create diverse 3D assets within 10 seconds. To enhance the training efficiency and exploit more geometric supervisions, e.g, depths and normals, we integrate a differentiable iso-surface extraction module into our framework and directly optimize on the mesh representation. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that InstantMesh significantly outperforms other latest image-to-3D baselines, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We release all the code, weights, and demo of InstantMesh, with the intention that it can make substantial contributions to the community of 3D generative AI and empower both researchers and content creators.</description>

      <title>RealmDreamer: Text-Driven 3D Scene Generation with Inpainting and Depth Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce RealmDreamer, a technique for generation of general forward-facing 3D scenes from text descriptions. Our technique optimizes a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation to match complex text prompts. We initialize these splats by utilizing the state-of-the-art text-to-image generators, lifting their samples into 3D, and computing the occlusion volume. We then optimize this representation across multiple views as a 3D inpainting task with image-conditional diffusion models. To learn correct geometric structure, we incorporate a depth diffusion model by conditioning on the samples from the inpainting model, giving rich geometric structure. Finally, we finetune the model using sharpened samples from image generators. Notably, our technique does not require video or multi-view data and can synthesize a variety of high-quality 3D scenes in different styles, consisting of multiple objects. Its generality additionally allows 3D synthesis from a single image.</description>

      <title>UMBRAE: Unified Multimodal Decoding of Brain Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address prevailing challenges of the brain-powered research, departing from the observation that the literature hardly recover accurate spatial information and require subject-specific models. To address these challenges, we propose UMBRAE, a unified multimodal decoding of brain signals. First, to extract instance-level conceptual and spatial details from neural signals, we introduce an efficient universal brain encoder for multimodal-brain alignment and recover object descriptions at multiple levels of granularity from subsequent multimodal large language model (MLLM). Second, we introduce a cross-subject training strategy mapping subject-specific features to a common feature space. This allows a model to be trained on multiple subjects without extra resources, even yielding superior results compared to subject-specific models. Further, we demonstrate this supports weakly-supervised adaptation to new subjects, with only a fraction of the total training data. Experiments demonstrate that UMBRAE not only achieves superior results in the newly introduced tasks but also outperforms methods in well established tasks. To assess our method, we construct and share with the community a comprehensive brain understanding benchmark BrainHub. Our code and benchmark are available at https://weihaox.github.io/UMBRAE.</description>

      <title>BRAVE: Broadening the visual encoding of vision-language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are typically composed of a vision encoder, e.g. CLIP, and a language model (LM) that interprets the encoded features to solve downstream tasks. Despite remarkable progress, VLMs are subject to several shortcomings due to the limited capabilities of vision encoders, e.g. "blindness" to certain image features, visual hallucination, etc. To address these issues, we study broadening the visual encoding capabilities of VLMs. We first comprehensively benchmark several vision encoders with different inductive biases for solving VLM tasks. We observe that there is no single encoding configuration that consistently achieves top performance across different tasks, and encoders with different biases can perform surprisingly similarly. Motivated by this, we introduce a method, named BRAVE, that consolidates features from multiple frozen encoders into a more versatile representation that can be directly fed as the input to a frozen LM. BRAVE achieves state-of-the-art performance on a broad range of captioning and VQA benchmarks and significantly reduces the aforementioned issues of VLMs, while requiring a smaller number of trainable parameters than existing methods and having a more compressed representation. Our results highlight the potential of incorporating different visual biases for a more broad and contextualized visual understanding of VLMs.</description>

      <title>GoodDrag: Towards Good Practices for Drag Editing with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce GoodDrag, a novel approach to improve the stability and image quality of drag editing. Unlike existing methods that struggle with accumulated perturbations and often result in distortions, GoodDrag introduces an AlDD framework that alternates between drag and denoising operations within the diffusion process, effectively improving the fidelity of the result. We also propose an information-preserving motion supervision operation that maintains the original features of the starting point for precise manipulation and artifact reduction. In addition, we contribute to the benchmarking of drag editing by introducing a new dataset, Drag100, and developing dedicated quality assessment metrics, Dragging Accuracy Index and Gemini Score, utilizing Large Multimodal Models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed GoodDrag compares favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively.

      <title>DiffObs: Generative Diffusion for Global Forecasting of Satellite Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents an autoregressive generative diffusion model (DiffObs) to predict the global evolution of daily precipitation, trained on a satellite observational product, and assessed with domain-specific diagnostics. The model is trained to probabilistically forecast day-ahead precipitation. Nonetheless, it is stable for multi-month rollouts, which reveal a qualitatively realistic superposition of convectively coupled wave modes in the tropics. Cross-spectral analysis confirms successful generation of low frequency variations associated with the Madden--Julian oscillation, which regulates most subseasonal to seasonal predictability in the observed atmosphere, and convectively coupled moist Kelvin waves with approximately correct dispersion relationships. Despite secondary issues and biases, the results affirm the potential for a next generation of global diffusion models trained on increasingly sparse, and increasingly direct and differentiated observations of the world, for practical applications in subseasonal and climate prediction.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Latents for Efficient Thermography Classification and Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breast cancer is a prominent health concern worldwide, currently being the secondmost common and second-deadliest type of cancer in women. While current breast cancer diagnosis mainly relies on mammography imaging, in recent years the use of thermography for breast cancer imaging has been garnering growing popularity. Thermographic imaging relies on infrared cameras to capture body-emitted heat distributions. While these heat signatures have proven useful for computer-vision systems for accurate breast cancer segmentation and classification, prior work often relies on handcrafted feature engineering or complex architectures, potentially limiting the comparability and applicability of these methods. In this work, we present a novel algorithm for both breast cancer classification and segmentation. Rather than focusing efforts on manual feature and architecture engineering, our algorithm focuses on leveraging an informative, learned feature space, thus making our solution simpler to use and extend to other frameworks and downstream tasks, as well as more applicable to data-scarce settings. Our classification produces SOTA results, while we are the first work to produce segmentation regions studied in this paper.</description>

      <title>SAM-I-Am: Semantic Boosting for Zero-shot Atomic-Scale Electron Micrograph Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical enabler for tasks ranging from medical diagnostics to autonomous driving. However, the correct segmentation semantics - where are boundaries located? what segments are logically similar? - change depending on the domain, such that state-of-the-art foundation models can generate meaningless and incorrect results. Moreover, in certain domains, fine-tuning and retraining techniques are infeasible: obtaining labels is costly and time-consuming; domain images (micrographs) can be exponentially diverse; and data sharing (for third-party retraining) is restricted. To enable rapid adaptation of the best segmentation technology, we propose the concept of semantic boosting: given a zero-shot foundation model, guide its segmentation and adjust results to match domain expectations. We apply semantic boosting to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to obtain microstructure segmentation for transmission electron microscopy. Our booster, SAM-I-Am, extracts geometric and textural features of various intermediate masks to perform mask removal and mask merging operations. We demonstrate a zero-shot performance increase of (absolute) +21.35%, +12.6%, +5.27% in mean IoU, and a -9.91%, -18.42%, -4.06% drop in mean false positive masks across images of three difficulty classes over vanilla SAM (ViT-L).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional deep learning-based image reconstruction methods require a large amount of training data which can be hard to obtain in practice. Untrained deep learning methods overcome this limitation by training a network to invert a physical model of the image formation process. Here we present a novel untrained Res-U2Net model for phase retrieval. We use the extracted phase information to determine changes in an object's surface and generate a mesh representation of its 3D structure. We compare the performance of Res-U2Net phase retrieval against UNet and U2Net using images from the GDXRAY dataset.</description>

      <title>Logit Calibration and Feature Contrast for Robust Federated Learning on Non-IID Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving distributed framework for collaborative model training on devices in edge networks. However, challenges arise due to vulnerability to adversarial examples (AEs) and the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) nature of data distribution among devices, hindering the deployment of adversarially robust and accurate learning models at the edge. While adversarial training (AT) is commonly acknowledged as an effective defense strategy against adversarial attacks in centralized training, we shed light on the adverse effects of directly applying AT in FL that can severely compromise accuracy, especially in non-IID challenges. Given this limitation, this paper proposes FatCC, which incorporates local logit \underline{C}alibration and global feature \underline{C}ontrast into the vanilla federated adversarial training (\underline{FAT}) process from both logit and feature perspectives. This approach can effectively enhance the federated system's robust accuracy (RA) and clean accuracy (CA). First, we propose logit calibration, where the logits are calibrated during local adversarial updates, thereby improving adversarial robustness. Second, FatCC introduces feature contrast, which involves a global alignment term that aligns each local representation with unbiased global features, thus further enhancing robustness and accuracy in federated adversarial environments. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that FatCC achieves comparable or superior performance gains in both CA and RA compared to other baselines.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Cardiac MRI Reconstruction with CMRatt: An Attention-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is recognised as the benchmark modality for the comprehensive assessment of cardiac function. Nevertheless, the acquisition process of cine CMR is considered as an impediment due to its prolonged scanning time. One commonly used strategy to expedite the acquisition process is through k-space undersampling, though it comes with a drawback of introducing aliasing effects in the reconstructed image. Lately, deep learning-based methods have shown remarkable results over traditional approaches in rapidly achieving precise CMR reconstructed images. This study aims to explore the untapped potential of attention mechanisms incorporated with a deep learning model within the context of the CMR reconstruction problem. We are motivated by the fact that attention has proven beneficial in downstream tasks such as image classification and segmentation, but has not been systematically analysed in the context of CMR reconstruction. Our primary goal is to identify the strengths and potential limitations of attention algorithms when integrated with a convolutional backbone model such as a U-Net. To achieve this, we benchmark different state-of-the-art spatial and channel attention mechanisms on the CMRxRecon dataset and quantitatively evaluate the quality of reconstruction using objective metrics. Furthermore, inspired by the best performing attention mechanism, we propose a new, simple yet effective, attention pipeline specifically optimised for the task of cardiac image reconstruction that outperforms other state-of-the-art attention methods. The layer and model code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Ray-driven Spectral CT Reconstruction Based on Neural Base-Material Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In spectral CT reconstruction, the basis materials decomposition involves solving a large-scale nonlinear system of integral equations, which is highly ill-posed mathematically. This paper proposes a model that parameterizes the attenuation coefficients of the object using a neural field representation, thereby avoiding the complex calculations of pixel-driven projection coefficient matrices during the discretization process of line integrals. It introduces a lightweight discretization method for line integrals based on a ray-driven neural field, enhancing the accuracy of the integral approximation during the discretization process. The basis materials are represented as continuous vector-valued implicit functions to establish a neural field parameterization model for the basis materials. The auto-differentiation framework of deep learning is then used to solve the implicit continuous function of the neural base-material fields. This method is not limited by the spatial resolution of reconstructed images, and the network has compact and regular properties. Experimental validation shows that our method performs exceptionally well in addressing the spectral CT reconstruction. Additionally, it fulfils the requirements for the generation of high-resolution reconstruction images.</description>

      <title>Wild Visual Navigation: Fast Traversability Learning via Pre-Trained Models and Online Self-Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural environments such as forests and grasslands are challenging for robotic navigation because of the false perception of rigid obstacles from high grass, twigs, or bushes. In this work, we present Wild Visual Navigation (WVN), an online self-supervised learning system for visual traversability estimation. The system is able to continuously adapt from a short human demonstration in the field, only using onboard sensing and computing. One of the key ideas to achieve this is the use of high-dimensional features from pre-trained self-supervised models, which implicitly encode semantic information that massively simplifies the learning task. Further, the development of an online scheme for supervision generator enables concurrent training and inference of the learned model in the wild. We demonstrate our approach through diverse real-world deployments in forests, parks, and grasslands. Our system is able to bootstrap the traversable terrain segmentation in less than 5 min of in-field training time, enabling the robot to navigate in complex, previously unseen outdoor terrains.

      <title>GCV-Turbo: End-to-end Acceleration of GNN-based Computer Vision Tasks on FPGA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently empowered various novel computer vision (CV) tasks. In GNN-based CV tasks, a combination of CNN layers and GNN layers or only GNN layers are employed. This paper introduces GCV-Turbo, a domain-specific accelerator on FPGA for end-to-end acceleration of GNN-based CV tasks. GCV-Turbo consists of two key components: (1) a \emph{novel} hardware architecture optimized for the computation kernels in both CNNs and GNNs using the same set of computation resources. (2) a PyTorch-compatible compiler that takes a user-defined model as input, performs end-to-end optimization for the computation graph of a given GNN-based CV task, and produces optimized code for hardware execution. The hardware architecture and the compiler work synergistically to support a variety of GNN-based CV tasks. We implement GCV-Turbo on a state-of-the-art FPGA and evaluate its performance across six representative GNN-based CV tasks with diverse input data modalities (e.g., image, human skeleton, point cloud). Compared with state-of-the-art CPU (GPU) implementations, GCV-Turbo achieves an average latency reduction of $68.4\times$ ($4.1\times$) on these six GNN-based CV tasks. Moreover, GCV-Turbo supports the execution of the standalone CNNs or GNNs, achieving performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art CNN (GNN) accelerators for widely used CNN-only (GNN-only) models.</description>

Abstract: Anticipating lane change intentions of surrounding vehicles is crucial for efficient and safe driving decision making in an autonomous driving system. Previous works often adopt physical variables such as driving speed, acceleration and so forth for lane change classification. However, physical variables do not contain semantic information. Although 3D CNNs have been developing rapidly, the number of methods utilising action recognition models and appearance feature for lane change recognition is low, and they all require additional information to pre-process data. In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework including two action recognition methods for lane change recognition, using video data collected by cameras. Our method achieves the best lane change classification results using only the RGB video data of the PREVENTION dataset. Class activation maps demonstrate that action recognition models can efficiently extract lane change motions. A method to better extract motion clues is also proposed in this paper.</description>

      <title>A Generic Shared Attention Mechanism for Various Backbone Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.16101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The self-attention mechanism has emerged as a critical component for improving the performance of various backbone neural networks. However, current mainstream approaches individually incorporate newly designed self-attention modules (SAMs) into each layer of the network for granted without fully exploiting their parameters' potential. This leads to suboptimal performance and increased parameter consumption as the network depth increases. To improve this paradigm, in this paper, we first present a counterintuitive but inherent phenomenon: SAMs tend to produce strongly correlated attention maps across different layers, with an average Pearson correlation coefficient of up to 0.85. Inspired by this inherent observation, we propose Dense-and-Implicit Attention (DIA), which directly shares SAMs across layers and employs a long short-term memory module to calibrate and bridge the highly correlated attention maps of different layers, thus improving the parameter utilization efficiency of SAMs. This design of DIA is also consistent with the neural network's dynamical system perspective. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our simple yet effective DIA can consistently enhance various network backbones, including ResNet, Transformer, and UNet, across tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image generation using diffusion models.</description>

Abstract: With advances in deep learning model training strategies, the training of Point cloud classification methods is significantly improving. For example, PointNeXt, which adopts prominent training techniques and InvResNet layers into PointNet++, achieves over 7% improvement on the real-world ScanObjectNN dataset. However, most of these models use point coordinates features of neighborhood points mapped to higher dimensional space while ignoring the neighborhood point features computed before feeding to the network layers. In this paper, we revisit the PointNeXt model to study the usage and benefit of such neighborhood point features. We train and evaluate PointNeXt on ModelNet40 (synthetic), ScanObjectNN (real-world), and a recent large-scale, real-world grocery dataset, i.e., 3DGrocery100. In addition, we provide an additional inference strategy of weight averaging the top two checkpoints of PointNeXt to improve classification accuracy. Together with the abovementioned ideas, we gain 0.5%, 1%, 4.8%, 3.4%, and 1.6% overall accuracy on the PointNeXt model with real-world datasets, ScanObjectNN (hardest variant), 3DGrocery100's Apple10, Fruits, Vegetables, and Packages subsets, respectively. We also achieve a comparable 0.2% accuracy gain on ModelNet40.</description>

Abstract: Accurate alignment of a fixed mobile device equipped with inertial sensors inside a moving vehicle is important for navigation, activity recognition, and other applications. Accurate estimation of the device mounting angle is required to rotate the inertial measurement from the sensor frame to the moving platform frame to standardize measurements and improve the performance of the target task. In this work, a data-driven approach using deep neural networks (DNNs) is proposed to learn the yaw mounting angle of a smartphone equipped with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and strapped to a car. The proposed model uses only the accelerometer and gyroscope readings from an IMU as input and, in contrast to existing solutions, does not require global position inputs from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). To train the model in a supervised manner, IMU data is collected for training and validation with the sensor mounted at a known yaw mounting angle, and a range of ground truth labels is generated by applying a random rotation in a bounded range to the measurements. The trained model is tested on data with real rotations showing similar performance as with synthetic rotations. The trained model is deployed on an Android device and evaluated in real-time to test the accuracy of the estimated yaw mounting angle. The model is shown to find the mounting angle at an accuracy of 8 degrees within 5 seconds, and 4 degrees within 27 seconds. An experiment is conducted to compare the proposed model with an existing off-the-shelf solution.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Diffusion For Strong and High Quality Face Morphing Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04218v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Face morphing attacks seek to deceive a Face Recognition (FR) system by presenting a morphed image consisting of the biometric qualities from two different identities with the aim of triggering a false acceptance with one of the two identities, thereby presenting a significant threat to biometric systems. The success of a morphing attack is dependent on the ability of the morphed image to represent the biometric characteristics of both identities that were used to create the image. We present a novel morphing attack that uses a Diffusion-based architecture to improve the visual fidelity of the image and the ability of the morphing attack to represent characteristics from both identities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack by evaluating its visual fidelity via the Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Also, extensive experiments are conducted to measure the vulnerability of FR systems to the proposed attack. The ability of a morphing attack detector to detect the proposed attack is measured and compared against two state-of-the-art GAN-based morphing attacks along with two Landmark-based attacks. Additionally, a novel metric to measure the relative strength between different morphing attacks is introduced and evaluated.</description>

Abstract: With the urgent demand for generalized deep models, many pre-trained big models are proposed, such as BERT, ViT, GPT, etc. Inspired by the success of these models in single domains (like computer vision and natural language processing), the multi-modal pre-trained big models have also drawn more and more attention in recent years. In this work, we give a comprehensive survey of these models and hope this paper could provide new insights and helps fresh researchers to track the most cutting-edge works. Specifically, we firstly introduce the background of multi-modal pre-training by reviewing the conventional deep learning, pre-training works in natural language process, computer vision, and speech. Then, we introduce the task definition, key challenges, and advantages of multi-modal pre-training models (MM-PTMs), and discuss the MM-PTMs with a focus on data, objectives, network architectures, and knowledge enhanced pre-training. After that, we introduce the downstream tasks used for the validation of large-scale MM-PTMs, including generative, classification, and regression tasks. We also give visualization and analysis of the model parameters and results on representative downstream tasks. Finally, we point out possible research directions for this topic that may benefit future works. In addition, we maintain a continuously updated paper list for large-scale pre-trained multi-modal big models: https://github.com/wangxiao5791509/MultiModal_BigModels_Survey.

      <title>AGILE3D: Attention Guided Interactive Multi-object 3D Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00977v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During interactive segmentation, a model and a user work together to delineate objects of interest in a 3D point cloud. In an iterative process, the model assigns each data point to an object (or the background), while the user corrects errors in the resulting segmentation and feeds them back into the model. The current best practice formulates the problem as binary classification and segments objects one at a time. The model expects the user to provide positive clicks to indicate regions wrongly assigned to the background and negative clicks on regions wrongly assigned to the object. Sequentially visiting objects is wasteful since it disregards synergies between objects: a positive click for a given object can, by definition, serve as a negative click for nearby objects. Moreover, a direct competition between adjacent objects can speed up the identification of their common boundary. We introduce AGILE3D, an efficient, attention-based model that (1) supports simultaneous segmentation of multiple 3D objects, (2) yields more accurate segmentation masks with fewer user clicks, and (3) offers faster inference. Our core idea is to encode user clicks as spatial-temporal queries and enable explicit interactions between click queries as well as between them and the 3D scene through a click attention module. Every time new clicks are added, we only need to run a lightweight decoder that produces updated segmentation masks. In experiments with four different 3D point cloud datasets, AGILE3D sets a new state-of-the-art. Moreover, we also verify its practicality in real-world setups with real user studies.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we delve into the properties of transformers, attained through self-supervision, in the point cloud domain. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of Masked Autoencoding as a pretraining scheme, and explore Momentum Contrast as an alternative. In our study we investigate the impact of data quantity on the learned features, and uncover similarities in the transformer's behavior across domains. Through comprehensive visualiations, we observe that the transformer learns to attend to semantically meaningful regions, indicating that pretraining leads to a better understanding of the underlying geometry. Moreover, we examine the finetuning process and its effect on the learned representations. Based on that, we devise an unfreezing strategy which consistently outperforms our baseline without introducing any other modifications to the model or the training pipeline, and achieve state-of-the-art results in the classification task among transformer models.</description>

      <title>Pyramid Deep Fusion Network for Two-Hand Reconstruction from RGB-D Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately recovering the dense 3D mesh of both hands from monocular images poses considerable challenges due to occlusions and projection ambiguity. Most of the existing methods extract features from color images to estimate the root-aligned hand meshes, which neglect the crucial depth and scale information in the real world. Given the noisy sensor measurements with limited resolution, depth-based methods predict 3D keypoints rather than a dense mesh. These limitations motivate us to take advantage of these two complementary inputs to acquire dense hand meshes on a real-world scale. In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework for recovering dense meshes for both hands, which employ single-view RGB-D image pairs as input. The primary challenge lies in effectively utilizing two different input modalities to mitigate the blurring effects in RGB images and noises in depth images. Instead of directly treating depth maps as additional channels for RGB images, we encode the depth information into the unordered point cloud to preserve more geometric details. Specifically, our framework employs ResNet50 and PointNet++ to derive features from RGB and point cloud, respectively. Additionally, we introduce a novel pyramid deep fusion network (PDFNet) to aggregate features at different scales, which demonstrates superior efficacy compared to previous fusion strategies. Furthermore, we employ a GCN-based decoder to process the fused features and recover the corresponding 3D pose and dense mesh. Through comprehensive ablation experiments, we have not only demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed fusion algorithm but also outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches on publicly available datasets. To reproduce the results, we will make our source code and models publicly available at {https://github.com/zijinxuxu/PDFNet}.</description>

      <title>Expediting Building Footprint Extraction from High-resolution Remote Sensing Images via progressive lenient supervision</title>

Abstract: The efficacy of building footprint segmentation from remotely sensed images has been hindered by model transfer effectiveness. Many existing building segmentation methods were developed upon the encoder-decoder architecture of U-Net, in which the encoder is finetuned from the newly developed backbone networks that are pre-trained on ImageNet. However, the heavy computational burden of the existing decoder designs hampers the successful transfer of these modern encoder networks to remote sensing tasks. Even the widely-adopted deep supervision strategy fails to mitigate these challenges due to its invalid loss in hybrid regions where foreground and background pixels are intermixed. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing decoder network designs for building footprint segmentation and propose an efficient framework denoted as BFSeg to enhance learning efficiency and effectiveness. Specifically, a densely-connected coarse-to-fine feature fusion decoder network that facilitates easy and fast feature fusion across scales is proposed. Moreover, considering the invalidity of hybrid regions in the down-sampled ground truth during the deep supervision process, we present a lenient deep supervision and distillation strategy that enables the network to learn proper knowledge from deep supervision. Building upon these advancements, we have developed a new family of building segmentation networks, which consistently surpass prior works with outstanding performance and efficiency across a wide range of newly developed encoder networks.</description>

Abstract: Buildings are the basic carrier of social production and human life; roads are the links that interconnect social networks. Building and road information has important application value in the frontier fields of regional coordinated development, disaster prevention, auto-driving, etc. Mapping buildings and roads from very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images have become a hot research topic. However, the existing methods often ignore the strong spatial correlation between roads and buildings and extract them in isolation. To fully utilize the complementary advantages between buildings and roads, we propose a building-road collaborative extraction method based on multi-task and cross-scale feature interaction to improve the accuracy of both tasks in a complementary way. A multi-task interaction module is proposed to interact information across tasks and preserve the unique information of each task, which tackle the seesaw phenomenon in multitask learning. By considering the variation in appearance and structure between buildings and roads, a cross-scale interaction module is designed to automatically learn the optimal reception field for different tasks. Compared with many existing methods that train each task individually, the proposed collaborative extraction method can utilize the complementary advantages between buildings and roads by the proposed inter-task and inter-scale feature interactions, and automatically select the optimal reception field for different tasks. Experiments on a wide range of urban and rural scenarios show that the proposed algorithm can achieve building-road extraction with outstanding performance and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10610v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning-based ear disease diagnosis technology has proven effective and affordable. However, due to the lack of ear endoscope datasets with diversity, the practical potential of the deep learning model has not been thoroughly studied. Moreover, existing research failed to achieve a good trade-off between model inference speed and parameter size, rendering models inapplicable in real-world settings. To address these challenges, we constructed the first large-scale ear endoscopic dataset comprising eight types of ear diseases and disease-free samples from two institutions. Inspired by ShuffleNetV2, we proposed Best-EarNet, an ultrafast and ultralight network enabling real-time ear disease diagnosis. Best-EarNet incorporates a novel Local-Global Spatial Feature Fusion Module and multi-scale supervision strategy, which facilitates the model focusing on global-local information within feature maps at various levels. Utilizing transfer learning, the accuracy of Best-EarNet with only 0.77M parameters achieves 95.23% (internal 22,581 images) and 92.14% (external 1,652 images), respectively. In particular, it achieves an average frame per second of 80 on the CPU. From the perspective of model practicality, the proposed Best-EarNet is superior to state-of-the-art backbone models in ear lesion detection tasks. Most importantly, Ear-keeper, an intelligent diagnosis system based Best-EarNet, was developed successfully and deployed on common electronic devices (smartphone, tablet computer and personal computer). In the future, Ear-Keeper has the potential to assist the public and healthcare providers in performing comprehensive scanning and diagnosis of the ear canal in real-time video, thereby promptly detecting ear lesions.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we present a new dataset to advance the state of the art in detecting citrus fruit and accurately estimate yield on trees affected by the Huanglongbing (HLB) disease in orchard environments via imaging. Despite the fact that significant progress has been made in solving the fruit detection problem, the lack of publicly available datasets has complicated direct comparison of results. For instance, citrus detection has long been of interest to the agricultural research community, yet there is an absence of work, particularly involving public datasets of citrus affected by HLB. To address this issue, we enhance state-of-the-art object detection methods for use in typical orchard settings. Concretely, we provide high-resolution images of citrus trees located in an area known to be highly affected by HLB, along with high-quality bounding box annotations of citrus fruit. Fruit on both the trees and the ground are labeled to allow for identification of fruit location, which contributes to advancements in yield estimation and potential measure of HLB impact via fruit drop. The dataset consists of over 32,000 bounding box annotations for fruit instances contained in 579 high-resolution images. In summary, our contributions are the following: (i) we introduce a novel dataset along with baseline performance benchmarks on multiple contemporary object detection algorithms, (ii) we show the ability to accurately capture fruit location on tree or on ground, and finally (ii) we present a correlation of our results with yield estimations.</description>

Abstract: In this work we present DREAM, an fMRI-to-image method for reconstructing viewed images from brain activities, grounded on fundamental knowledge of the human visual system. We craft reverse pathways that emulate the hierarchical and parallel nature of how humans perceive the visual world. These tailored pathways are specialized to decipher semantics, color, and depth cues from fMRI data, mirroring the forward pathways from visual stimuli to fMRI recordings. To do so, two components mimic the inverse processes within the human visual system: the Reverse Visual Association Cortex (R-VAC) which reverses pathways of this brain region, extracting semantics from fMRI data; the Reverse Parallel PKM (R-PKM) component simultaneously predicting color and depth from fMRI signals. The experiments indicate that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art models in terms of the consistency of appearance, structure, and semantics. Code will be made publicly available to facilitate further research in this field.</description>

      <title>Physics-guided Shape-from-Template: Monocular Video Perception through Neural Surrogate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes is a long-standing problem in computer graphics and increasingly difficult the less information is available. Shape-from-Template (SfT) methods aim to reconstruct a template-based geometry from RGB images or video sequences, often leveraging just a single monocular camera without depth information, such as regular smartphone recordings. Unfortunately, existing reconstruction methods are either unphysical and noisy or slow in optimization. To solve this problem, we propose a novel SfT reconstruction algorithm for cloth using a pre-trained neural surrogate model that is fast to evaluate, stable, and produces smooth reconstructions due to a regularizing physics simulation. Differentiable rendering of the simulated mesh enables pixel-wise comparisons between the reconstruction and a target video sequence that can be used for a gradient-based optimization procedure to extract not only shape information but also physical parameters such as stretching, shearing, or bending stiffness of the cloth. This allows to retain a precise, stable, and smooth reconstructed geometry while reducing the runtime by a factor of 400-500 compared to $\phi$-SfT, a state-of-the-art physics-based SfT approach.</description>

      <title>SocialCounterfactuals: Probing and Mitigating Intersectional Social Biases in Vision-Language Models with Counterfactual Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance improvements recently, there is growing evidence that these models also posses harmful biases with respect to social attributes such as gender and race. Prior studies have primarily focused on probing such bias attributes individually while ignoring biases associated with intersections between social attributes. This could be due to the difficulty of collecting an exhaustive set of image-text pairs for various combinations of social attributes. To address this challenge, we employ text-to-image diffusion models to produce counterfactual examples for probing intersectional social biases at scale. Our approach utilizes Stable Diffusion with cross attention control to produce sets of counterfactual image-text pairs that are highly similar in their depiction of a subject (e.g., a given occupation) while differing only in their depiction of intersectional social attributes (e.g., race &amp; gender). Through our over-generate-then-filter methodology, we produce SocialCounterfactuals, a high-quality dataset containing 171k image-text pairs for probing intersectional biases related to gender, race, and physical characteristics. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the usefulness of our generated dataset for probing and mitigating intersectional social biases in state-of-the-art VLMs.</description>

      <title>Improving the Generalization of Segmentation Foundation Model under Distribution Shift via Weakly Supervised Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of large language models has inspired the computer vision community to explore image segmentation foundation model that is able to zero/few-shot generalize through prompt engineering. Segment-Anything(SAM), among others, is the state-of-the-art image segmentation foundation model demonstrating strong zero/few-shot generalization. Despite the success, recent studies reveal the weakness of SAM under strong distribution shift. In particular, SAM performs awkwardly on corrupted natural images, camouflaged images, medical images, etc. Motivated by the observations, we aim to develop a self-training based strategy to adapt SAM to target distribution. Given the unique challenges of large source dataset, high computation cost and incorrect pseudo label, we propose a weakly supervised self-training architecture with anchor regularization and low-rank finetuning to improve the robustness and computation efficiency of adaptation. We validate the effectiveness on 5 types of downstream segmentation tasks including natural clean/corrupted images, medical images, camouflaged images and robotic images. Our proposed method is task-agnostic in nature and outperforms pre-trained SAM and state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods on almost all downstream tasks with the same testing prompt inputs.</description>

      <title>Quilt-LLaVA: Visual Instruction Tuning by Extracting Localized Narratives from Open-Source Histopathology Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diagnosis in histopathology requires a global whole slide images (WSIs) analysis, requiring pathologists to compound evidence from different WSI patches. The gigapixel scale of WSIs poses a challenge for histopathology multi-modal models. Training multi-model models for histopathology requires instruction tuning datasets, which currently contain information for individual image patches, without a spatial grounding of the concepts within each patch and without a wider view of the WSI. Therefore, they lack sufficient diagnostic capacity for histopathology. To bridge this gap, we introduce Quilt-Instruct, a large-scale dataset of 107,131 histopathology-specific instruction question/answer pairs, grounded within diagnostically relevant image patches that make up the WSI. Our dataset is collected by leveraging educational histopathology videos from YouTube, which provides spatial localization of narrations by automatically extracting the narrators' cursor positions. Quilt-Instruct supports contextual reasoning by extracting diagnosis and supporting facts from the entire WSI. Using Quilt-Instruct, we train Quilt-LLaVA, which can reason beyond the given single image patch, enabling diagnostic reasoning across patches. To evaluate Quilt-LLaVA, we propose a comprehensive evaluation dataset created from 985 images and 1283 human-generated question-answers. We also thoroughly evaluate Quilt-LLaVA using public histopathology datasets, where Quilt-LLaVA significantly outperforms SOTA by over 10% on relative GPT-4 score and 4% and 9% on open and closed set VQA. Our code, data, and model are publicly accessible at quilt-llava.github.io.</description>

      <title>DG-TTA: Out-of-domain medical image segmentation through Domain Generalization and Test-Time Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Applying pre-trained medical segmentation models on out-of-domain images often yields predictions of insufficient quality. Several strategies have been proposed to maintain model performance, such as finetuning or unsupervised- and source-free domain adaptation. These strategies set restrictive requirements for data availability. In this study, we propose to combine domain generalization and test-time adaptation to create a highly effective approach for reusing pre-trained models in unseen target domains. Domain-generalized pre-training on source data is used to obtain the best initial performance in the target domain. We introduce the MIND descriptor previously used in image registration tasks as a further technique to achieve generalization and present superior performance for small-scale datasets compared to existing approaches. At test-time, high-quality segmentation for every single unseen scan is ensured by optimizing the model weights for consistency given different image augmentations. That way, our method enables separate use of source and target data and thus removes current data availability barriers. Moreover, the presented method is highly modular as it does not require specific model architectures or prior knowledge of involved domains and labels. We demonstrate this by integrating it into the nnUNet, which is currently the most popular and accurate framework for medical image segmentation. We employ multiple datasets covering abdominal, cardiac, and lumbar spine scans and compose several out-of-domain scenarios in this study. We demonstrate that our method, combined with pre-trained whole-body CT models, can effectively segment MR images with high accuracy in all of the aforementioned scenarios.

      <title>BOTH2Hands: Inferring 3D Hands from Both Text Prompts and Body Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07937v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently emerging text-to-motion advances have spired numerous attempts for convenient and interactive human motion generation. Yet, existing methods are largely limited to generating body motions only without considering the rich two-hand motions, let alone handling various conditions like body dynamics or texts. To break the data bottleneck, we propose BOTH57M, a novel multi-modal dataset for two-hand motion generation. Our dataset includes accurate motion tracking for the human body and hands and provides pair-wised finger-level hand annotations and body descriptions. We further provide a strong baseline method, BOTH2Hands, for the novel task: generating vivid two-hand motions from both implicit body dynamics and explicit text prompts. We first warm up two parallel body-to-hand and text-to-hand diffusion models and then utilize the cross-attention transformer for motion blending. Extensive experiments and cross-validations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and dataset for generating convincing two-hand motions from the hybrid body-and-textual conditions. Our dataset and code will be disseminated to the community for future research.</description>

      <title>TAM-VT: Transformation-Aware Multi-scale Video Transformer for Segmentation and Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) has emerged as an increasingly important problem with availability of larger datasets and more complex and realistic settings, which involve long videos with global motion (e.g, in egocentric settings), depicting small objects undergoing both rigid and non-rigid (including state) deformations. While a number of recent approaches have been explored for this task, these data characteristics still present challenges. In this work we propose a novel, clip-based DETR-style encoder-decoder architecture, which focuses on systematically analyzing and addressing aforementioned challenges. Specifically, we propose a novel transformation-aware loss that focuses learning on portions of the video where an object undergoes significant deformations -- a form of "soft" hard examples mining. Further, we propose a multiplicative time-coded memory, beyond vanilla additive positional encoding, which helps propagate context across long videos. Finally, we incorporate these in our proposed holistic multi-scale video transformer for tracking via multi-scale memory matching and decoding to ensure sensitivity and accuracy for long videos and small objects. Our model enables on-line inference with long videos in a windowed fashion, by breaking the video into clips and propagating context among them. We illustrate that short clip length and longer memory with learned time-coding are important design choices for improved performance. Collectively, these technical contributions enable our model to achieve new state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on two complex egocentric datasets -- VISOR and VOST, while achieving comparable to SoTA results on the conventional VOS benchmark, DAVIS'17. A series of detailed ablations validate our design choices as well as provide insights into the importance of parameter choices and their impact on performance.</description>

      <title>CLOVA: A Closed-Loop Visual Assistant with Tool Usage and Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing large language models (LLMs) to compose off-the-shelf visual tools represents a promising avenue of research for developing robust visual assistants capable of addressing diverse visual tasks. However, these methods often overlook the potential for continual learning, typically by freezing the utilized tools, thus limiting their adaptation to environments requiring new knowledge. To tackle this challenge, we propose CLOVA, a Closed-Loop Visual Assistant, which operates within a framework encompassing inference, reflection, and learning phases. During the inference phase, LLMs generate programs and execute corresponding tools to complete assigned tasks. In the reflection phase, a multimodal global-local reflection scheme analyzes human feedback to determine which tools require updating. Lastly, the learning phase employs three flexible approaches to automatically gather training data and introduces a novel prompt tuning scheme to update the tools, allowing CLOVA to efficiently acquire new knowledge. Experimental findings demonstrate that CLOVA surpasses existing tool-usage methods by 5% in visual question answering and multiple-image reasoning, by 10% in knowledge tagging, and by 20% in image editing. These results underscore the significance of the continual learning capability in general visual assistants.</description>

      <title>Pre-trained Model Guided Fine-Tuning for Zero-Shot Adversarial Robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks, and exhibit remarkable zero-shot generalization capability, while they are also vulnerable to imperceptible adversarial examples. Existing works typically employ adversarial training (fine-tuning) as a defense method against adversarial examples. However, direct application to the CLIP model may result in overfitting, compromising the model's capacity for generalization. In this paper, we propose Pre-trained Model Guided Adversarial Fine-Tuning (PMG-AFT) method, which leverages supervision from the original pre-trained model by carefully designing an auxiliary branch, to enhance the model's zero-shot adversarial robustness. Specifically, PMG-AFT minimizes the distance between the features of adversarial examples in the target model and those in the pre-trained model, aiming to preserve the generalization features already captured by the pre-trained model. Extensive Experiments on 15 zero-shot datasets demonstrate that PMG-AFT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method, improving the top-1 robust accuracy by an average of 4.99%. Furthermore, our approach consistently improves clean accuracy by an average of 8.72%.

      <title>MaskClustering: View Consensus based Mask Graph Clustering for Open-Vocabulary 3D Instance Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation is cutting-edge for its ability to segment 3D instances without predefined categories. However, progress in 3D lags behind its 2D counterpart due to limited annotated 3D data. To address this, recent works first generate 2D open-vocabulary masks through 2D models and then merge them into 3D instances based on metrics calculated between two neighboring frames. In contrast to these local metrics, we propose a novel metric, view consensus rate, to enhance the utilization of multi-view observations. The key insight is that two 2D masks should be deemed part of the same 3D instance if a significant number of other 2D masks from different views contain both these two masks. Using this metric as edge weight, we construct a global mask graph where each mask is a node. Through iterative clustering of masks showing high view consensus, we generate a series of clusters, each representing a distinct 3D instance. Notably, our model is training-free. Through extensive experiments on publicly available datasets, including ScanNet++, ScanNet200 and MatterPort3D, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) have long been the predominant backbone networks for visual representation learning. While ViTs have recently gained prominence over CNNs due to their superior fitting capabilities, their scalability is largely constrained by the quadratic complexity of attention computation. Inspired by the capability of Mamba in efficiently modeling long sequences, we propose VMamba, a generic vision backbone model aiming to reduce the computational complexity to linear while retaining ViTs' advantageous features. To enhance VMamba's adaptability in processing vision data, we introduce the Cross-Scan Module (CSM) to enable 1D selective scanning in 2D image space with global receptive fields. Additionally, we make further improvements in implementation details and architectural designs to enhance VMamba's performance and boost its inference speed. Extensive experimental results demonstrate VMamba's promising performance across various visual perception tasks, highlighting its pronounced advantages in input scaling efficiency compared to existing benchmark models.

      <title>Understanding Video Transformers via Universal Concept Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of concept-based interpretability of transformer representations for videos. Concretely, we seek to explain the decision-making process of video transformers based on high-level, spatiotemporal concepts that are automatically discovered. Prior research on concept-based interpretability has concentrated solely on image-level tasks. Comparatively, video models deal with the added temporal dimension, increasing complexity and posing challenges in identifying dynamic concepts over time. In this work, we systematically address these challenges by introducing the first Video Transformer Concept Discovery (VTCD) algorithm. To this end, we propose an efficient approach for unsupervised identification of units of video transformer representations - concepts, and ranking their importance to the output of a model. The resulting concepts are highly interpretable, revealing spatio-temporal reasoning mechanisms and object-centric representations in unstructured video models. Performing this analysis jointly over a diverse set of supervised and self-supervised representations, we discover that some of these mechanism are universal in video transformers. Finally, we show that VTCD can be used for fine-grained action recognition and video object segmentation.</description>

      <title>$\lambda$-ECLIPSE: Multi-Concept Personalized Text-to-Image Diffusion Models by Leveraging CLIP Latent Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the recent advances in personalized text-to-image (P-T2I) generative models, it remains challenging to perform finetuning-free multi-subject-driven T2I in a resource-efficient manner. Predominantly, contemporary approaches, involving the training of Hypernetworks and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), require heavy computing resources that range from 600 to 12300 GPU hours of training. These subject-driven T2I methods hinge on Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), which facilitate T2I mapping through cross-attention layers. While LDMs offer distinct advantages, P-T2I methods' reliance on the latent space of these diffusion models significantly escalates resource demands, leading to inconsistent results and necessitating numerous iterations for a single desired image. In this paper, we present $\lambda$-ECLIPSE, an alternative prior-training strategy that works in the latent space of a pre-trained CLIP model without relying on the diffusion UNet models. $\lambda$-ECLIPSE leverages the image-text interleaved pre-training for fast and effective multi-subject-driven P-T2I. Through extensive experiments, we establish that $\lambda$-ECLIPSE surpasses existing baselines in composition alignment while preserving concept alignment performance, even with significantly lower resource utilization. $\lambda$-ECLIPSE performs multi-subject driven P-T2I with just 34M parameters and is trained on a mere 74 GPU hours. Additionally, $\lambda$-ECLIPSE demonstrates the unique ability to perform multi-concept interpolations.</description>

      <title>Location-guided Head Pose Estimation for Fisheye Image</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Camera with a fisheye or ultra-wide lens covers a wide field of view that cannot be modeled by the perspective projection. Serious fisheye lens distortion in the peripheral region of the image leads to degraded performance of the existing head pose estimation models trained on undistorted images. This paper presents a new approach for head pose estimation that uses the knowledge of head location in the image to reduce the negative effect of fisheye distortion. We develop an end-to-end convolutional neural network to estimate the head pose with the multi-task learning of head pose and head location. Our proposed network estimates the head pose directly from the fisheye image without the operation of rectification or calibration. We also created a fisheye-distorted version of the three popular head pose estimation datasets, BIWI, 300W-LP, and AFLW2000 for our experiments. Experiments results show that our network remarkably improves the accuracy of head pose estimation compared with other state-of-the-art one-stage and two-stage methods.</description>

However, batteries are highly sensitive to small manufacturing variations that can induce reliability or safety issues. An important technology for battery quality control is computed tomography (CT) scanning, which is widely used for non-destructive 3D inspection across a variety of clinical and industrial applications. Historically, however, the utility of CT scanning for high-volume manufacturing has been limited by its low throughput as well as the difficulty of handling its large file sizes. In this work, we present a dataset of over one thousand CT scans of as-produced commercially available batteries. The dataset spans various chemistries (lithium-ion and sodium-ion) as well as various battery form factors (cylindrical, pouch, and prismatic). We evaluate seven different battery types in total. The manufacturing variability and the presence of battery defects can be observed via this dataset. This dataset may be of interest to scientists and engineers working on battery technology, computer vision, or both.</description>

      <title>Triple-CFN: Restructuring Conceptual Spaces for Enhancing Abstract Reasoning process</title>

Abstract: Abstract reasoning problems pose significant challenges to artificial intelligence algorithms, demanding cognitive capabilities beyond those required for perception tasks. This study introduces the Triple-CFN approach to tackle the Bongard-Logo problem, achieving notable reasoning accuracy by implicitly reorganizing the concept space of conflicting instances. Additionally, the Triple-CFN paradigm proves effective for the RPM problem with necessary modifications, yielding competitive results. To further enhance performance on the RPM issue, we develop the Meta Triple-CFN network, which explicitly structures the problem space while maintaining interpretability on progressive patterns. The success of Meta Triple-CFN is attributed to its paradigm of modeling the conceptual space, equivalent to normalizing reasoning information. Based on this ideology, we introduce the Re-space layer, enhancing the performance of both Meta Triple-CFN and Triple-CFN. This paper aims to contribute to advancements in machine intelligence by exploring innovative network designs for addressing abstract reasoning problems, paving the way for further breakthroughs in this domain.</description>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are designed to process and integrate information from multiple sources, such as text, speech, images, and videos. Despite its success in language understanding, it is critical to evaluate the performance of downstream tasks for better human-centric applications. This paper assesses the application of MLLMs with 5 crucial abilities for affective computing, spanning from visual affective tasks and reasoning tasks. The results show that \gpt has high accuracy in facial action unit recognition and micro-expression detection while its general facial expression recognition performance is not accurate. We also highlight the challenges of achieving fine-grained micro-expression recognition and the potential for further study and demonstrate the versatility and potential of \gpt for handling advanced tasks in emotion recognition and related fields by integrating with task-related agents for more complex tasks, such as heart rate estimation through signal processing. In conclusion, this paper provides valuable insights into the potential applications and challenges of MLLMs in human-centric computing.

      <description>arXiv:2403.08092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through a large-scale study over diverse face images, we show that facial attribute editing using modern generative AI models can severely degrade automated face recognition systems. This degradation persists even with identity-preserving generative models. To mitigate this issue, we propose two novel techniques for local and global attribute editing. We empirically ablate twenty-six facial semantic, demographic and expression-based attributes that have been edited using state-of-the-art generative models, and evaluate them using ArcFace and AdaFace matchers on CelebA, CelebAMaskHQ and LFW datasets. Finally, we use LLaVA, an emerging visual question-answering framework for attribute prediction to validate our editing techniques. Our methods outperform the current state-of-the-art at facial editing (BLIP, InstantID) while improving identity retention by a significant extent.</description>

Abstract: Integrating LiDAR and camera information into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representation has emerged as a crucial aspect of 3D object detection in autonomous driving. However, existing methods are susceptible to the inaccurate calibration relationship between LiDAR and the camera sensor. Such inaccuracies result in errors in depth estimation for the camera branch, ultimately causing misalignment between LiDAR and camera BEV features. In this work, we propose a robust fusion framework called Graph BEV. Addressing errors caused by inaccurate point cloud projection, we introduce a Local Align module that employs neighbor-aware depth features via Graph matching. Additionally, we propose a Global Align module to rectify the misalignment between LiDAR and camera BEV features. Our Graph BEV framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an mAP of 70.1\%, surpassing BEV Fusion by 1.6\% on the nuscenes validation set. Importantly, our Graph BEV outperforms BEV Fusion by 8.3\% under conditions with misalignment noise.</description>

      <title>Multi-Level Label Correction by Distilling Proximate Patterns for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation relieves the reliance on large-scale labeled data by leveraging unlabeled data. Recent semi-supervised semantic segmentation approaches mainly resort to pseudo-labeling methods to exploit unlabeled data. However, unreliable pseudo-labeling can undermine the semi-supervision processes. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called Multi-Level Label Correction (MLLC), which aims to use graph neural networks to capture structural relationships in Semantic-Level Graphs (SLGs) and Class-Level Graphs (CLGs) to rectify erroneous pseudo-labels. Specifically, SLGs represent semantic affinities between pairs of pixel features, and CLGs describe classification consistencies between pairs of pixel labels. With the support of proximate pattern information from graphs, MLLC can rectify incorrectly predicted pseudo-labels and can facilitate discriminative feature representations. We design an end-to-end network to train and perform this effective label corrections mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that MLLC can significantly improve supervised baselines and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in different scenarios on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets. Specifically, MLLC improves the supervised baseline by at least 5% and 2% with DeepLabV2 and DeepLabV3+ respectively under different partition protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding what deep network models capture in their learned representations is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. We present a new methodology to understanding such vision models, the Visual Concept Connectome (VCC), which discovers human interpretable concepts and their interlayer connections in a fully unsupervised manner. Our approach simultaneously reveals fine-grained concepts at a layer, connection weightings across all layers and is amendable to global analysis of network structure (e.g., branching pattern of hierarchical concept assemblies). Previous work yielded ways to extract interpretable concepts from single layers and examine their impact on classification, but did not afford multilayer concept analysis across an entire network architecture. Quantitative and qualitative empirical results show the effectiveness of VCCs in the domain of image classification. Also, we leverage VCCs for the application of failure mode debugging to reveal where mistakes arise in deep networks.</description>

      <title>RS-Mamba for Large Remote Sensing Image Dense Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context modeling is critical for remote sensing image dense prediction tasks. Nowadays, the growing size of very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images poses challenges in effectively modeling context. While transformer-based models possess global modeling capabilities, they encounter computational challenges when applied to large VHR images due to their quadratic complexity. The conventional practice of cropping large images into smaller patches results in a notable loss of contextual information. To address these issues, we propose the Remote Sensing Mamba (RSM) for dense prediction tasks in large VHR remote sensing images. RSM is specifically designed to capture the global context of remote sensing images with linear complexity, facilitating the effective processing of large VHR images. Considering that the land covers in remote sensing images are distributed in arbitrary spatial directions due to characteristics of remote sensing over-head imaging, the RSM incorporates an omnidirectional selective scan module to globally model the context of images in multiple directions, capturing large spatial features from various directions. Extensive experiments on semantic segmentation and change detection tasks across various land covers demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RSM. We designed simple yet effective models based on RSM, achieving state-of-the-art performance on dense prediction tasks in VHR remote sensing images without fancy training strategies. Leveraging the linear complexity and global modeling capabilities, RSM achieves better efficiency and accuracy than transformer-based models on large remote sensing images. Interestingly, we also demonstrated that our model generally performs better with a larger image size on dense prediction tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/walking-shadow/Official_Remote_Sensing_Mamba.</description>

      <title>LongVLM: Efficient Long Video Understanding via Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs), recent advancements in VideoLLMs have driven progress in various video understanding tasks. These models encode video representations through pooling or query aggregation over a vast number of visual tokens, making computational and memory costs affordable. Despite successfully providing an overall comprehension of video content, existing VideoLLMs still face challenges in achieving detailed understanding in videos due to overlooking local information in long-term videos. To tackle this challenge, we introduce LongVLM, a straightforward yet powerful VideoLLM for long video understanding, building upon the observation that long videos often consist of sequential key events, complex actions, and camera movements. Our approach proposes to decompose long videos into multiple short-term segments and encode local features for each local segment via a hierarchical token merging module. These features are concatenated in temporal order to maintain the storyline across sequential short-term segments. Additionally, we propose to integrate global semantics into each local feature to enhance context understanding. In this way, we encode video representations that incorporate both local and global information, enabling the LLM to generate comprehensive responses for long-term videos. Experimental results on the VideoChatGPT benchmark and zero-shot video question-answering datasets demonstrate the superior capabilities of our model over the previous state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative examples demonstrate that our model produces more precise responses for long videos understanding. Code will be available at https://github.com/ziplab/LongVLM.</description>

      <title>No "Zero-Shot" Without Exponential Data: Pretraining Concept Frequency Determines Multimodal Model Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Web-crawled pretraining datasets underlie the impressive "zero-shot" evaluation performance of multimodal models, such as CLIP for classification/retrieval and Stable-Diffusion for image generation. However, it is unclear how meaningful the notion of "zero-shot" generalization is for such multimodal models, as it is not known to what extent their pretraining datasets encompass the downstream concepts targeted for during "zero-shot" evaluation. In this work, we ask: How is the performance of multimodal models on downstream concepts influenced by the frequency of these concepts in their pretraining datasets? We comprehensively investigate this question across 34 models and five standard pretraining datasets (CC-3M, CC-12M, YFCC-15M, LAION-400M, LAION-Aesthetics), generating over 300GB of data artifacts. We consistently find that, far from exhibiting "zero-shot" generalization, multimodal models require exponentially more data to achieve linear improvements in downstream "zero-shot" performance, following a sample inefficient log-linear scaling trend. This trend persists even when controlling for sample-level similarity between pretraining and downstream datasets, and testing on purely synthetic data distributions. Furthermore, upon benchmarking models on long-tailed data sampled based on our analysis, we demonstrate that multimodal models across the board perform poorly. We contribute this long-tail test set as the "Let it Wag!" benchmark to further research in this direction. Taken together, our study reveals an exponential need for training data which implies that the key to "zero-shot" generalization capabilities under large-scale training paradigms remains to be found.</description>

      <title>AUEditNet: Dual-Branch Facial Action Unit Intensity Manipulation with Implicit Disentanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Facial action unit (AU) intensity plays a pivotal role in quantifying fine-grained expression behaviors, which is an effective condition for facial expression manipulation. However, publicly available datasets containing intensity annotations for multiple AUs remain severely limited, often featuring a restricted number of subjects. This limitation places challenges to the AU intensity manipulation in images due to disentanglement issues, leading researchers to resort to other large datasets with pretrained AU intensity estimators for pseudo labels. In addressing this constraint and fully leveraging manual annotations of AU intensities for precise manipulation, we introduce AUEditNet. Our proposed model achieves impressive intensity manipulation across 12 AUs, trained effectively with only 18 subjects. Utilizing a dual-branch architecture, our approach achieves comprehensive disentanglement of facial attributes and identity without necessitating additional loss functions or implementing with large batch sizes. This approach offers a potential solution to achieve desired facial attribute editing despite the dataset's limited subject count. Our experiments demonstrate AUEditNet's superior accuracy in editing AU intensities, affirming its capability in disentangling facial attributes and identity within a limited subject pool. AUEditNet allows conditioning by either intensity values or target images, eliminating the need for constructing AU combinations for specific facial expression synthesis. Moreover, AU intensity estimation, as a downstream task, validates the consistency between real and edited images, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed AU intensity manipulation method.</description>

      <title>Better Monocular 3D Detectors with LiDAR from the Past</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection is crucial to autonomous driving. Though LiDAR-based detectors have achieved impressive performance, the high cost of LiDAR sensors precludes their widespread adoption in affordable vehicles. Camera-based detectors are cheaper alternatives but often suffer inferior performance compared to their LiDAR-based counterparts due to inherent depth ambiguities in images. In this work, we seek to improve monocular 3D detectors by leveraging unlabeled historical LiDAR data. Specifically, at inference time, we assume that the camera-based detectors have access to multiple unlabeled LiDAR scans from past traversals at locations of interest (potentially from other high-end vehicles equipped with LiDAR sensors). Under this setup, we proposed a novel, simple, and end-to-end trainable framework, termed AsyncDepth, to effectively extract relevant features from asynchronous LiDAR traversals of the same location for monocular 3D detectors. We show consistent and significant performance gain (up to 9 AP) across multiple state-of-the-art models and datasets with a negligible additional latency of 9.66 ms and a small storage cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaze is an essential prompt for analyzing human behavior and attention. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in determining gaze direction from facial videos. However, video gaze estimation faces significant challenges, such as understanding the dynamic evolution of gaze in video sequences, dealing with static backgrounds, and adapting to variations in illumination. To address these challenges, we propose a simple and novel deep learning model designed to estimate gaze from videos, incorporating a specialized attention module. Our method employs a spatial attention mechanism that tracks spatial dynamics within videos. This technique enables accurate gaze direction prediction through a temporal sequence model, adeptly transforming spatial observations into temporal insights, thereby significantly improving gaze estimation accuracy. Additionally, our approach integrates Gaussian processes to include individual-specific traits, facilitating the personalization of our model with just a few labeled samples. Experimental results confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach, demonstrating its success in both within-dataset and cross-dataset settings. Specifically, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Gaze360 dataset, improving by $2.5^\circ$ without personalization. Further, by personalizing the model with just three samples, we achieved an additional improvement of $0.8^\circ$. The code and pre-trained models are available at \url{https://github.com/jswati31/stage}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Close and continuous interaction with rich contacts is a crucial aspect of human activities (e.g. hugging, dancing) and of interest in many domains like activity recognition, motion prediction, character animation, etc. However, acquiring such skeletal motion is challenging. While direct motion capture is expensive and slow, motion editing/generation is also non-trivial, as complex contact patterns with topological and geometric constraints have to be retained. To this end, we propose a new deep learning method for two-body skeletal interaction motion augmentation, which can generate variations of contact-rich interactions with varying body sizes and proportions while retaining the key geometric/topological relations between two bodies. Our system can learn effectively from a relatively small amount of data and generalize to drastically different skeleton sizes. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, we show it can generate high-quality motions, has strong generalizability and outperforms traditional optimization-based methods and alternative deep learning solutions.</description>

      <title>Little Strokes Fell Great Oaks: Boosting the Hierarchical Features for Multi-exposure Image Fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning networks have made remarkable strides in the domain of multi-exposure image fusion. Nonetheless, prevailing approaches often involve directly feeding over-exposed and under-exposed images into the network, which leads to the under-utilization of inherent information present in the source images. Additionally, unsupervised techniques predominantly employ rudimentary weighted summation for color channel processing, culminating in an overall desaturated final image tone. To partially mitigate these issues, this study proposes a gamma correction module specifically designed to fully leverage latent information embedded within source images. Furthermore, a modified transformer block, embracing with self-attention mechanisms, is introduced to optimize the fusion process. Ultimately, a novel color enhancement algorithm is presented to augment image saturation while preserving intricate details.

      <title>Exploring the Potential of Large Foundation Models for Open-Vocabulary HOI Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary human-object interaction (HOI) detection, which is concerned with the problem of detecting novel HOIs guided by natural language, is crucial for understanding human-centric scenes. However, prior zero-shot HOI detectors often employ the same levels of feature maps to model HOIs with varying distances, leading to suboptimal performance in scenes containing human-object pairs with a wide range of distances. In addition, these detectors primarily rely on category names and overlook the rich contextual information that language can provide, which is essential for capturing open vocabulary concepts that are typically rare and not well-represented by category names alone. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end open vocabulary HOI detection framework with conditional multi-level decoding and fine-grained semantic enhancement (CMD-SE), harnessing the potential of Visual-Language Models (VLMs). Specifically, we propose to model human-object pairs with different distances with different levels of feature maps by incorporating a soft constraint during the bipartite matching process. Furthermore, by leveraging large language models (LLMs) such as GPT models, we exploit their extensive world knowledge to generate descriptions of human body part states for various interactions. Then we integrate the generalizable and fine-grained semantics of human body parts to improve interaction recognition. Experimental results on two datasets, SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET, demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in open vocabulary HOI detection.

      <title>Flying with Photons: Rendering Novel Views of Propagating Light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an imaging and neural rendering technique that seeks to synthesize videos of light propagating through a scene from novel, moving camera viewpoints. Our approach relies on a new ultrafast imaging setup to capture a first-of-its kind, multi-viewpoint video dataset with picosecond-level temporal resolution. Combined with this dataset, we introduce an efficient neural volume rendering framework based on the transient field. This field is defined as a mapping from a 3D point and 2D direction to a high-dimensional, discrete-time signal that represents time-varying radiance at ultrafast timescales. Rendering with transient fields naturally accounts for effects due to the finite speed of light, including viewpoint-dependent appearance changes caused by light propagation delays to the camera. We render a range of complex effects, including scattering, specular reflection, refraction, and diffraction. Additionally, we demonstrate removing viewpoint-dependent propagation delays using a time warping procedure, rendering of relativistic effects, and video synthesis of direct and global components of light transport.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Hand-Held Objects in 3D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objects manipulated by the hand (i.e., manipulanda) are particularly challenging to reconstruct from in-the-wild RGB images or videos. Not only does the hand occlude much of the object, but also the object is often only visible in a small number of image pixels. At the same time, two strong anchors emerge in this setting: (1) estimated 3D hands help disambiguate the location and scale of the object, and (2) the set of manipulanda is small relative to all possible objects. With these insights in mind, we present a scalable paradigm for handheld object reconstruction that builds on recent breakthroughs in large language/vision models and 3D object datasets. Our model, MCC-Hand-Object (MCC-HO), jointly reconstructs hand and object geometry given a single RGB image and inferred 3D hand as inputs. Subsequently, we use GPT-4(V) to retrieve a 3D object model that matches the object in the image and rigidly align the model to the network-inferred geometry; we call this alignment Retrieval-Augmented Reconstruction (RAR). Experiments demonstrate that MCC-HO achieves state-of-the-art performance on lab and Internet datasets, and we show how RAR can be used to automatically obtain 3D labels for in-the-wild images of hand-object interactions.</description>

      <title>Discovering Closed-Loop Failures of Vision-Based Controllers via Reachability Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02736v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning driven image-based controllers allow robotic systems to take intelligent actions based on the visual feedback from their environment. Understanding when these controllers might lead to system safety violations is important for their integration in safety-critical applications and engineering corrective safety measures for the system. Existing methods leverage simulation-based testing (or falsification) to find the failures of vision-based controllers, i.e., the visual inputs that lead to closed-loop safety violations. However, these techniques do not scale well to the scenarios involving high-dimensional and complex visual inputs, such as RGB images. In this work, we cast the problem of finding closed-loop vision failures as a Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability problem. Our approach blends simulation-based analysis with HJ reachability methods to compute an approximation of the backward reachable tube (BRT) of the system, i.e., the set of unsafe states for the system under vision-based controllers. Utilizing the BRT, we can tractably and systematically find the system states and corresponding visual inputs that lead to closed-loop failures. These visual inputs can be subsequently analyzed to find the input characteristics that might have caused the failure. Besides its scalability to high-dimensional visual inputs, an explicit computation of BRT allows the proposed approach to capture non-trivial system failures that are difficult to expose via random simulations. We demonstrate our framework on two case studies involving an RGB image-based neural network controller for (a) autonomous indoor navigation, and (b) autonomous aircraft taxiing.</description>

      <title>Disentangled Explanations of Neural Network Predictions by Finding Relevant Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explainable AI aims to overcome the black-box nature of complex ML models like neural networks by generating explanations for their predictions. Explanations often take the form of a heatmap identifying input features (e.g. pixels) that are relevant to the model's decision. These explanations, however, entangle the potentially multiple factors that enter into the overall complex decision strategy. We propose to disentangle explanations by extracting at some intermediate layer of a neural network, subspaces that capture the multiple and distinct activation patterns (e.g. visual concepts) that are relevant to the prediction. To automatically extract these subspaces, we propose two new analyses, extending principles found in PCA or ICA to explanations. These novel analyses, which we call principal relevant component analysis (PRCA) and disentangled relevant subspace analysis (DRSA), maximize relevance instead of e.g. variance or kurtosis. This allows for a much stronger focus of the analysis on what the ML model actually uses for predicting, ignoring activations or concepts to which the model is invariant. Our approach is general enough to work alongside common attribution techniques such as Shapley Value, Integrated Gradients, or LRP. Our proposed methods show to be practically useful and compare favorably to the state of the art as demonstrated on benchmarks and three use cases.</description>

      <title>nnMobileNe: Rethinking CNN for Retinopathy Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been at the forefront of the detection and tracking of various retinal diseases (RD). Despite their success, the emergence of vision transformers (ViT) in the 2020s has shifted the trajectory of RD model development. The leading-edge performance of ViT-based models in RD can be largely credited to their scalability-their ability to improve as more parameters are added. As a result, ViT-based models tend to outshine traditional CNNs in RD applications, albeit at the cost of increased data and computational demands. ViTs also differ from CNNs in their approach to processing images, working with patches rather than local regions, which can complicate the precise localization of small, variably presented lesions in RD. In our study, we revisited and updated the architecture of a CNN model, specifically MobileNet, to enhance its utility in RD diagnostics. We found that an optimized MobileNet, through selective modifications, can surpass ViT-based models in various RD benchmarks, including diabetic retinopathy grading, detection of multiple fundus diseases, and classification of diabetic macular edema.

      <title>Unsupervised Denoising for Signal-Dependent and Row-Correlated Imaging Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate analysis of microscopy images is hindered by the presence of noise. This noise is usually signal-dependent and often additionally correlated along rows or columns of pixels. Current self- and unsupervised denoisers can address signal-dependent noise, but none can reliably remove noise that is also row- or column-correlated. Here, we present the first fully unsupervised deep learning-based denoiser capable of handling imaging noise that is row-correlated as well as signal-dependent. Our approach uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a specially designed autoregressive decoder. This decoder is capable of modeling row-correlated and signal-dependent noise but is incapable of independently modeling underlying clean signal. The VAE therefore produces latent variables containing only clean signal information, and these are mapped back into image space using a proposed second decoder network. Our method does not require a pre-trained noise model and can be trained from scratch using unpaired noisy data. We show that our approach achieves competitive results when applied to a range of different sensor types and imaging modalities.</description>

      <title>Phase Guided Light Field for Spatial-Depth High Resolution 3D Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On 3D imaging, light field cameras typically are of single shot, and however, they heavily suffer from low spatial resolution and depth accuracy. In this paper, by employing an optical projector to project a group of single high-frequency phase-shifted sinusoid patterns, we propose a phase guided light field algorithm to significantly improve both the spatial and depth resolutions for off-the-shelf light field cameras. First, for correcting the axial aberrations caused by the main lens of our light field camera, we propose a deformed cone model to calibrate our structured light field system. Second, over wrapped phases computed from patterned images, we propose a stereo matching algorithm, i.e. phase guided sum of absolute difference, to robustly obtain the correspondence for each pair of neighbored two lenslets. Finally, by introducing a virtual camera according to the basic geometrical optics of light field imaging, we propose a reorganization strategy to reconstruct 3D point clouds with spatial-depth high resolution. Experimental results show that, compared with the state-of-the-art active light field methods, the proposed reconstructs 3D point clouds with a spatial resolution of 1280$\times$720 with factors 10$\times$ increased, while maintaining the same high depth resolution and needing merely a single group of high-frequency patterns.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Range Gesture Recognition using a Web-Camera in Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hand gestures play a significant role in human interactions where non-verbal intentions, thoughts and commands are conveyed. In Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), hand gestures offer a similar and efficient medium for conveying clear and rapid directives to a robotic agent. However, state-of-the-art vision-based methods for gesture recognition have been shown to be effective only up to a user-camera distance of seven meters. Such a short distance range limits practical HRI with, for example, service robots, search and rescue robots and drones. In this work, we address the Ultra-Range Gesture Recognition (URGR) problem by aiming for a recognition distance of up to 25 meters and in the context of HRI. We propose the URGR framework, a novel deep-learning, using solely a simple RGB camera. Gesture inference is based on a single image. First, a novel super-resolution model termed High-Quality Network (HQ-Net) uses a set of self-attention and convolutional layers to enhance the low-resolution image of the user. Then, we propose a novel URGR classifier termed Graph Vision Transformer (GViT) which takes the enhanced image as input. GViT combines the benefits of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and a modified Vision Transformer (ViT). Evaluation of the proposed framework over diverse test data yields a high recognition rate of 98.1%. The framework has also exhibited superior performance compared to human recognition in ultra-range distances. With the framework, we analyze and demonstrate the performance of an autonomous quadruped robot directed by human gestures in complex ultra-range indoor and outdoor environments, acquiring 96% recognition rate on average.</description>

      <title>GLiDR: Topologically Regularized Graph Generative Network for Sparse LiDAR Point Clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse LiDAR point clouds cause severe loss of detail of static structures and reduce the density of static points available for navigation. Reduced density can be detrimental to navigation under several scenarios. We observe that despite high sparsity, in most cases, the global topology of LiDAR outlining the static structures can be inferred. We utilize this property to obtain a backbone skeleton of a LiDAR scan in the form of a single connected component that is a proxy to its global topology. We utilize the backbone to augment new points along static structures to overcome sparsity. Newly introduced points could correspond to existing static structures or to static points that were earlier obstructed by dynamic objects. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use such a strategy for sparse LiDAR point clouds. Existing solutions close to our approach fail to identify and preserve the global static LiDAR topology and generate sub-optimal points. We propose GLiDR, a Graph Generative network that is topologically regularized using 0-dimensional Persistent Homology ($\mathcal{PH}$) constraints. This enables GLiDR to introduce newer static points along a topologically consistent global static LiDAR backbone. GLiDR generates precise static points using $32\times$ sparser dynamic scans and performs better than the baselines across three datasets. GLiDR generates a valuable byproduct - an accurate binary segmentation mask of static and dynamic objects that are helpful for navigation planning and safety in constrained environments. The newly introduced static points allow GLiDR to outperform LiDAR-based navigation using SLAM in several settings. Source code is available at $\texttt{https://github.com/GLiDR-CVPR2024/GLiDR}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10144v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of multimodal alignment is to learn a single latent space that is shared between multimodal inputs. The most powerful models in this space have been trained using massive datasets of paired inputs and large-scale computational resources, making them prohibitively expensive to train in many practical scenarios. We surmise that existing unimodal encoders pre-trained on large amounts of unimodal data should provide an effective bootstrap to create multimodal models from unimodal ones at much lower costs. We therefore propose FuseMix, a multimodal augmentation scheme that operates on the latent spaces of arbitrary pre-trained unimodal encoders. Using FuseMix for multimodal alignment, we achieve competitive performance -- and in certain cases outperform state-of-the art methods -- in both image-text and audio-text retrieval, with orders of magnitude less compute and data: for example, we outperform CLIP on the Flickr30K text-to-image retrieval task with $\sim \! 600\times$ fewer GPU days and $\sim \! 80\times$ fewer image-text pairs. Additionally, we show how our method can be applied to convert pre-trained text-to-image generative models into audio-to-image ones.

      <title>Bias-Reduced Neural Networks for Parameter Estimation in Quantitative MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop neural network (NN)-based quantitative MRI parameter estimators with minimal bias and a variance close to the Cram\'er-Rao bound.
  Theory and Methods: We generalize the mean squared error loss to control the bias and variance of the NN's estimates, which involves averaging over multiple noise realizations of the same measurements during training. Bias and variance properties of the resulting NNs are studied for two neuroimaging applications.
  Results: In simulations, the proposed strategy reduces the estimates' bias throughout parameter space and achieves a variance close to the Cram\'er-Rao bound. In vivo, we observe good concordance between parameter maps estimated with the proposed NNs and traditional estimators, such as non-linear least-squares fitting, while state-of-the-art NNs show larger deviations.
  Conclusion: The proposed NNs have greatly reduced bias compared to those trained using the mean squared error and offer significantly improved computational efficiency over traditional estimators with comparable or better accuracy.</description>

      <title>MixedNUTS: Training-Free Accuracy-Robustness Balance via Nonlinearly Mixed Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial robustness often comes at the cost of degraded accuracy, impeding the real-life application of robust classification models. Training-based solutions for better trade-offs are limited by incompatibilities with already-trained high-performance large models, necessitating the exploration of training-free ensemble approaches. Observing that robust models are more confident in correct predictions than in incorrect ones on clean and adversarial data alike, we speculate amplifying this "benign confidence property" can reconcile accuracy and robustness in an ensemble setting. To achieve so, we propose "MixedNUTS", a training-free method where the output logits of a robust classifier and a standard non-robust classifier are processed by nonlinear transformations with only three parameters, which are optimized through an efficient algorithm. MixedNUTS then converts the transformed logits into probabilities and mixes them as the overall output. On CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets, experimental results with custom strong adaptive attacks demonstrate MixedNUTS's vastly improved accuracy and near-SOTA robustness -- it boosts CIFAR-100 clean accuracy by 7.86 points, sacrificing merely 0.87 points in robust accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07354v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identification of tumor margins is essential for surgical decision-making for glioblastoma patients and provides reliable assistance for neurosurgeons. Despite improvements in deep learning architectures for tumor segmentation over the years, creating a fully autonomous system suitable for clinical floors remains a formidable challenge because the model predictions have not yet reached the desired level of accuracy and generalizability for clinical applications. Generative modeling techniques have seen significant improvements in recent times. Specifically, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Denoising-diffusion-based models (DDPMs) have been used to generate higher-quality images with fewer artifacts and finer attributes. In this work, we introduce a framework called Re-Diffinet for modeling the discrepancy between the outputs of a segmentation model like U-Net and the ground truth, using DDPMs. By explicitly modeling the discrepancy, the results show an average improvement of 0.55\% in the Dice score and 16.28\% in HD95 from cross-validation over 5-folds, compared to the state-of-the-art U-Net segmentation model.</description>

      <title>GaussianImage: 1000 FPS Image Representation and Compression by 2D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) recently achieved great success in image representation and compression, offering high visual quality and fast rendering speeds with 10-1000 FPS, assuming sufficient GPU resources are available. However, this requirement often hinders their use on low-end devices with limited memory. In response, we propose a groundbreaking paradigm of image representation and compression by 2D Gaussian Splatting, named GaussianImage. We first introduce 2D Gaussian to represent the image, where each Gaussian has 8 parameters including position, covariance and color. Subsequently, we unveil a novel rendering algorithm based on accumulated summation. Remarkably, our method with a minimum of 3$\times$ lower GPU memory usage and 5$\times$ faster fitting time not only rivals INRs (e.g., WIRE, I-NGP) in representation performance, but also delivers a faster rendering speed of 1500-2000 FPS regardless of parameter size. Furthermore, we integrate existing vector quantization technique to build an image codec. Experimental results demonstrate that our codec attains rate-distortion performance comparable to compression-based INRs such as COIN and COIN++, while facilitating decoding speeds of approximately 1000 FPS. Additionally, preliminary proof of concept shows that our codec surpasses COIN and COIN++ in performance when using partial bits-back coding.

      <title>Diffusion based Zero-shot Medical Image-to-Image Translation for Cross Modality Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-modality image segmentation aims to segment the target modalities using a method designed in the source modality. Deep generative models can translate the target modality images into the source modality, thus enabling cross-modality segmentation. However, a vast body of existing cross-modality image translation methods relies on supervised learning. In this work, we aim to address the challenge of zero-shot learning-based image translation tasks (extreme scenarios in the target modality is unseen in the training phase). To leverage generative learning for zero-shot cross-modality image segmentation, we propose a novel unsupervised image translation method. The framework learns to translate the unseen source image to the target modality for image segmentation by leveraging the inherent statistical consistency between different modalities for diffusion guidance. Our framework captures identical cross-modality features in the statistical domain, offering diffusion guidance without relying on direct mappings between the source and target domains. This advantage allows our method to adapt to changing source domains without the need for retraining, making it highly practical when sufficient labeled source domain data is not available. The proposed framework is validated in zero-shot cross-modality image segmentation tasks through empirical comparisons with influential generative models, including adversarial-based and diffusion-based models.</description>

      <title>Two-Phase Multi-Dose-Level PET Image Reconstruction with Dose Level Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To obtain high-quality positron emission tomography (PET) while minimizing radiation exposure, a range of methods have been designed to reconstruct standard-dose PET (SPET) from corresponding low-dose PET (LPET) images. However, most current methods merely learn the mapping between single-dose-level LPET and SPET images, but omit the dose disparity of LPET images in clinical scenarios. In this paper, to reconstruct high-quality SPET images from multi-dose-level LPET images, we design a novel two-phase multi-dose-level PET reconstruction algorithm with dose level awareness, containing a pre-training phase and a SPET prediction phase. Specifically, the pre-training phase is devised to explore both fine-grained discriminative features and effective semantic representation. The SPET prediction phase adopts a coarse prediction network utilizing pre-learned dose level prior to generate preliminary result, and a refinement network to precisely preserve the details. Experiments on MICCAI 2022 Ultra-low Dose PET Imaging Challenge Dataset have demonstrated the superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>Towards Enhanced Analysis of Lung Cancer Lesions in EBUS-TBNA -- A Semi-Supervised Video Object Detection Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study aims to establish a computer-aided diagnostic system for lung lesions using bronchoscope endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) to assist physicians in identifying lesion areas. During EBUS-transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) procedures, physicians rely on grayscale ultrasound images to determine the location of lesions. However, these images often contain significant noise and can be influenced by surrounding tissues or blood vessels, making interpretation challenging. Previous research has lacked the application of object detection models to EBUS-TBNA, and there has been no well-defined solution for annotating the EBUS-TBNA dataset. In related studies on ultrasound images, although models have been successful in capturing target regions for their respective tasks, their training and predictions have been based on two-dimensional images, limiting their ability to leverage temporal features for improved predictions. This study introduces a three-dimensional image-based object detection model. It utilizes an attention mechanism to capture temporal correlations and we will implements a filtering mechanism to select relevant information from previous frames. Subsequently, a teacher-student model training approach is employed to optimize the model further, leveraging unlabeled data. To mitigate the impact of poor-quality pseudo-labels on the student model, we will add a special Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to ensure the quality of pseudo-labels.</description>

      <title>Using Few-Shot Learning to Classify Primary Lung Cancer and Other Malignancy with Lung Metastasis in Cytological Imaging via Endobronchial Ultrasound Procedures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study aims to establish a computer-aided diagnosis system for endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) surgery to assist physicians in the preliminary diagnosis of metastatic cancer. This involves arranging immediate examinations for other sites of metastatic cancer after EBUS surgery, eliminating the need to wait for reports, thereby shortening the waiting time by more than half and enabling patients to detect other cancers earlier, allowing for early planning and implementation of treatment plans. Unlike previous studies on cell image classification, which have abundant datasets for training, this study must also be able to make effective classifications despite the limited amount of case data for lung metastatic cancer. In the realm of small data set classification methods, Few-shot learning (FSL) has become mainstream in recent years. Through its ability to train on small datasets and its strong generalization capabilities, FSL shows potential in this task of lung metastatic cell image classification. This study will adopt the approach of Few-shot learning, referencing existing proposed models, and designing a model architecture for classifying lung metastases cell images. Batch Spectral Regularization (BSR) will be incorporated as a loss update parameter, and the Finetune method of PMF will be modified. In terms of test results, the addition of BSR and the modified Finetune method further increases the accuracy by 8.89% to 65.60%, outperforming other FSL methods. This study confirms that FSL is superior to supervised and transfer learning in classifying metastatic cancer and demonstrates that using BSR as a loss function and modifying Finetune can enhance the model's capabilities.</description>

      <title>Text-Based Reasoning About Vector Graphics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large multimodal models excel in broad vision-language benchmarks, they often struggle with tasks requiring precise perception of low-level visual details, such as comparing line lengths or solving simple mazes. In particular, this failure mode persists in question-answering tasks about vector graphics -- images composed purely of 2D objects and shapes. To address this challenge, we propose the Visually Descriptive Language Model (VDLM), which performs text-based reasoning about vector graphics. VDLM leverages Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for a more precise visual description and first uses an off-the-shelf raster-to-SVG algorithm for encoding. Since existing language models cannot understand raw SVGs in a zero-shot setting, VDLM then bridges SVG with pretrained language models through a newly introduced intermediate symbolic representation, Primal Visual Description (PVD), comprising primitive attributes (e.g., shape, position, measurement) with their corresponding predicted values. PVD is task-agnostic and represents visual primitives that are universal across all vector graphics. It can be learned with procedurally generated (SVG, PVD) pairs and also enables the direct use of LLMs for generalization to complex reasoning tasks. By casting an image to a text-based representation, we can leverage the power of language models to learn alignment from SVG to visual primitives and generalize to unseen question-answering tasks. Empirical results show that VDLM achieves stronger zero-shot performance compared to state-of-the-art LMMs, such as GPT-4V, in various low-level multimodal perception and reasoning tasks on vector graphics. We additionally present extensive analyses on VDLM's performance, demonstrating that our framework offers better interpretability due to its disentangled perception and reasoning processes.
