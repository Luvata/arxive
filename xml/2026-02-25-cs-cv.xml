      <title>Replication Study: Federated Text-Driven Prompt Generation for Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capabilities, yet their adaptation to federated learning scenarios presents significant challenges, particularly regarding generalization to unseen classes. The original FedTPG paper \cite{Qiu2024} addresses this limitation by introducing a text driven prompt generation network that dynamically creates prompts conditioned on class names, enabling better cross-class generalization in federated settings. In this work, we present a faithful replication study of FedTPG, evaluating the pre-trained model on six diverse vision datasets: Caltech101, Oxford Flowers, FGVC Aircraft, Oxford Pets, Food-101, and DTD. Our evaluation achieves results within 0.2\% of the original paper's reported accuracies, with an average accuracy of 74.58\% on seen (base) classes and 76.00\% on unseen (new) classes, demonstrating a +1.43 percentage point improvement in generalization. These results validate the original paper's core claims: (1) text-driven prompt generation enables superior generalization to unseen classes compared to static prompt learning methods, and (2) federated training of prompt generators maintains high performance across diverse visual domains without sharing private data. Our successful replication confirms the robustness and reproducibility of the FedTPG approach.</description>

      <title>A Patient-Specific Digital Twin for Adaptive Radiotherapy of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiotherapy continues to become more precise and data dense, with current treatment regimens generating high frequency imaging and dosimetry streams ideally suited for AI driven temporal modeling to characterize how normal tissues evolve with time. Each fraction in biologically guided radiotherapy(BGRT) treated non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients records new metabolic, anatomical, and dose information. However, clinical decision making is largely informed by static, population based NTCP models which overlook the dynamic, unique biological trajectories encoded in sequential data. We developed COMPASS (Comprehensive Personalized Assessment System) for safe radiotherapy, functioning as a temporal digital twin architecture utilizing per fraction PET, CT, dosiomics, radiomics, and cumulative biologically equivalent dose (BED) kinetics to model normal tissue biology as a dynamic time series process. A GRU autoencoder was employed to learn organ specific latent trajectories, which were classified via logistic regression to predict eventual CTCAE grade 1 or higher toxicity. Eight NSCLC patients undergoing BGRT contributed to the 99 organ fraction observations covering 24 organ trajectories (spinal cord, heart, and esophagus). Despite the small cohort, intensive temporal phenotyping allowed for comprehensive analysis of individual dose response dynamics. Our findings revealed a viable AI driven early warning window, as increasing risk ratings occurred from several fractions before clinical toxicity. The dense BED driven representation revealed biologically relevant spatial dose texture characteristics that occur before toxicity and are averaged out with traditional volume based dosimetry. COMPASS establishes a proof of concept for AI enabled adaptive radiotherapy, where treatment is guided by a continually updated digital twin that tracks each patients evolving biological response.</description>

      <title>Scaling Ultrasound Volumetric Reconstruction via Mobile Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate volumetric characterization of lesions is essential for oncologic diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment planning. While imaging modalities such as Computed Tomography provide high-quality 3D data, 2D ultrasound (2D-US) remains the preferred first-line modality for breast and thyroid imaging due to cost, portability, and safety factors. However, volume estimates derived from 2D-US suffer from high inter-user variability even among experienced clinicians. Existing 3D ultrasound (3D-US) solutions use specialized probes or external tracking hardware, but such configurations increase costs and diminish portability, constraining widespread clinical use. To address these limitations, we present Mobile Augmented Reality Volumetric Ultrasound (MARVUS), a resource-efficient system designed to increase accessibility to accurate and reproducible volumetric assessment. MARVUS is interoperable with conventional ultrasound (US) systems, using a foundation model to enhance cross-specialty generalization while minimizing hardware requirements relative to current 3D-US solutions. In a user study involving experienced clinicians performing measurements on breast phantoms, MARVUS yielded a substantial improvement in volume estimation accuracy (mean difference: 0.469 cm3) with reduced inter-user variability (mean difference: 0.417 cm3). Additionally, we prove that augmented reality (AR) visualizations enhance objective performance metrics and clinician-reported usability. Collectively, our findings suggests that MARVUS can enhance US-based cancer screening, diagnostic workflows, and treatment planning in a scalable, cost-conscious, and resource-efficient manner.

      <title>Mitigating Shortcut Learning via Feature Disentanglement in Medical Imaging: A Benchmark Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve excellent classification performance, they can rely on shortcut learning, exploiting spurious correlations or confounding factors that are not causally related to the target task. This poses risks in clinical settings, where models must generalize across institutions, populations, and acquisition conditions. Feature disentanglement is a promising approach to mitigate shortcut learning by separating task-relevant information from confounder-related features in latent representations. In this study, we systematically evaluated feature disentanglement methods for mitigating shortcuts in medical imaging, including adversarial learning and latent space splitting based on dependence minimization. We assessed classification performance and disentanglement quality using latent space analyses across one artificial and two medical datasets with natural and synthetic confounders. We also examined robustness under varying levels of confounding and compared computational efficiency across methods. We found that shortcut mitigation methods improved classification performance under strong spurious correlations during training. Latent space analyses revealed differences in representation quality not captured by classification metrics, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each method. Model reliance on shortcuts depended on the degree of confounding in the training data. The best-performing models combine data-centric rebalancing with model-centric disentanglement, achieving stronger and more robust shortcut mitigation than rebalancing alone while maintaining similar computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Computer Vision Framework for Multi-Class Detection and Tracking in Soccer Broadcast Footage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clubs with access to expensive multi-camera setups or GPS tracking systems gain a competitive advantage through detailed data, whereas lower-budget teams are often unable to collect similar information. This paper examines whether such data can instead be extracted directly from standard broadcast footage using a single-camera computer vision pipeline. This project develops an end-to-end system that combines a YOLO object detector with the ByteTrack tracking algorithm to identify and track players, referees, goalkeepers, and the ball throughout a match. Experimental results show that the pipeline achieves high performance in detecting and tracking players and officials, with strong precision, recall, and mAP50 scores, while ball detection remains the primary challenge. Despite this limitation, our findings demonstrate that AI can extract meaningful player-level spatial information from a single broadcast camera. By reducing reliance on specialized hardware, the proposed approach enables colleges, academies, and amateur clubs to adopt scalable, data-driven analysis methods previously accessible only to professional teams, highlighting the potential for affordable computer vision-based soccer analytics.</description>

      <title>Suppression or Deletion: A Restoration-Based Representation-Level Analysis of Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As pretrained models are increasingly shared on the web, ensuring that models can forget or delete sensitive, copyrighted, or private information upon request has become crucial. Machine unlearning has been proposed to address this challenge. However, current evaluations for unlearning methods rely on output-based metrics, which cannot verify whether information is completely deleted or merely suppressed at the representation level, where suppression is insufficient for true unlearning. To address this gap, we propose a novel restoration-based analysis framework that uses Sparse Autoencoders to identify class-specific expert features in intermediate layers and applies inference-time steering to quantitatively distinguish between suppression and deletion. Applying our framework to 12 major unlearning methods in image classification tasks, we find that most methods achieve high restoration rates of unlearned information, indicating that they only suppress information at the decision-boundary level, while preserving semantic features in intermediate representations. Notably, even retraining from pretrained checkpoints shows high restoration, revealing that robust semantic features inherited from pretraining are not removed by retraining. These results demonstrate that representation-level retention poses significant risks overlooked by output-based metrics, highlighting the need for new unlearning evaluation criteria. We propose new evaluation guidelines that prioritize representation-level verification, especially for privacy-critical applications in the era of pre-trained models.</description>

      <title>Depth from Defocus via Direct Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though there exists a reasonable forward model for blur based on optical physics, recovering depth from a collection of defocused images remains a computationally challenging optimization problem. In this paper, we show that with contemporary optimization methods and reasonable computing resources, a global optimization approach to depth from defocus is feasible. Our approach rests on alternating minimization. When holding the depth map fixed, the forward model is linear with respect to the all-in-focus image. When holding the all-in-focus image fixed, the depth at each pixel can be computed independently, enabling embarrassingly parallel computation. We show that alternating between convex optimization and parallel grid search can effectively solve the depth-from-defocus problem at higher resolutions than current deep learning methods. We demonstrate our approach on benchmark datasets with synthetic and real defocus blur and show promising results compared to prior approaches.

      <title>Sketch2Feedback: Grammar-in-the-Loop Framework for Rubric-Aligned Feedback on Student STEM Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing timely, rubric-aligned feedback on student-drawn diagrams is a persistent challenge in STEM education. While large multimodal models (LMMs) can jointly parse images and generate explanations, their tendency to hallucinate undermines trust in classroom deployments. We present Sketch2Feedback, a grammar-in-the-loop framework that decomposes the problem into four stages -- hybrid perception, symbolic graph construction, constraint checking, and constrained VLM feedback -- so that the language model verbalizes only violations verified by an upstream rule engine. We evaluate on two synthetic micro-benchmarks, FBD-10 (free-body diagrams) and Circuit-10 (circuit schematics), each with 500 images spanning standard and hard noise augmentation tiers, comparing our pipeline against end-to-end LMMs (LLaVA-1.5-7B, Qwen2-VL-7B), a vision-only detector, a YOLOv8-nano learned detector, and an ensemble oracle. On n=100 test samples per benchmark with 95% bootstrap CIs, results are mixed and instructive: Qwen2-VL-7B achieves the highest micro-F1 on both FBDs (0.570) and circuits (0.528), but with extreme hallucination rates (0.78, 0.98). An ensemble oracle that selects the best prediction per sample reaches F1=0.556 with hallucination 0.320 on FBDs, demonstrating exploitable complementarity between grammar and end-to-end approaches. Confidence thresholding at tau=0.7 reduces circuit hallucination from 0.970 to 0.880 with no F1 loss. Hard noise augmentation reveals domain-dependent robustness: FBD detection is resilient while circuit detection degrades sharply. An LLM-as-judge evaluation confirms that the grammar pipeline produces more actionable circuit feedback (4.85/5) than the end-to-end LMM (3.11/5). We release all code, datasets, and evaluation scripts.</description>

      <title>Do Generative Metrics Predict YOLO Performance? An Evaluation Across Models, Augmentation Ratios, and Dataset Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic images are increasingly used to augment object-detection training sets, but reliably evaluating a synthetic dataset before training remains difficult: standard global generative metrics (e.g., FID) often do not predict downstream detection mAP. We present a controlled evaluation of synthetic augmentation for YOLOv11 across three single-class detection regimes -- Traffic Signs (sparse/near-saturated), Cityscapes Pedestrian (dense/occlusion-heavy), and COCO PottedPlant (multi-instance/high-variability). We benchmark six GAN-, diffusion-, and hybrid-based generators over augmentation ratios from 10% to 150% of the real training split, and train YOLOv11 both from scratch and with COCO-pretrained initialization, evaluating on held-out real test splits (mAP@0.50:0.95). For each dataset-generator-augmentation configuration, we compute pre-training dataset metrics under a matched-size bootstrap protocol, including (i) global feature-space metrics in both Inception-v3 and DINOv2 embeddings and (ii) object-centric distribution distances over bounding-box statistics. Synthetic augmentation yields substantial gains in the more challenging regimes (up to +7.6% and +30.6% relative mAP in Pedestrian and PottedPlant, respectively) but is marginal in Traffic Signs and under pretrained fine-tuning. To separate metric signal from augmentation quantity, we report both raw and augmentation-controlled (residualized) correlations with multiple-testing correction, showing that metric-performance alignment is strongly regime-dependent and that many apparent raw associations weaken after controlling for augmentation level.</description>

      <title>JAEGER: Joint 3D Audio-Visual Grounding and Reasoning in Simulated Physical Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current audio-visual large language models (AV-LLMs) are predominantly restricted to 2D perception, relying on RGB video and monaural audio. This design choice introduces a fundamental dimensionality mismatch that precludes reliable source localization and spatial reasoning in complex 3D environments. We address this limitation by presenting JAEGER, a framework that extends AV-LLMs to 3D space, to enable joint spatial grounding and reasoning through the integration of RGB-D observations and multi-channel first-order ambisonics. A core contribution of our work is the neural intensity vector (Neural IV), a learned spatial audio representation that encodes robust directional cues to enhance direction-of-arrival estimation, even in adverse acoustic scenarios with overlapping sources. To facilitate large-scale training and systematic evaluation, we propose SpatialSceneQA, a benchmark of 61k instruction-tuning samples curated from simulated physical environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses 2D-centric baselines across diverse spatial perception and reasoning tasks, underscoring the necessity of explicit 3D modelling for advancing AI in physical environments. Our source code, pre-trained model checkpoints and datasets will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Image-Based Classification of Olive Varieties Native to Turkiye Using Multiple Deep Learning Architectures: Analysis of Performance, Complexity, and Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study compares multiple deep learning architectures for the automated, image-based classification of five locally cultivated black table olive varieties in Turkey: Gemlik, Ayvalik, Uslu, Erkence, and Celebi. Using a dataset of 2500 images, ten architectures - MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetV2-S, ResNet50, ResNet101, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, ConvNeXt-Tiny, ViT-B16, and Swin-T - were trained using transfer learning. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Cohen's Kappa, ROC-AUC, number of parameters, FLOPs, inference time, and generalization gap. EfficientNetV2-S achieved the highest classification accuracy (95.8%), while EfficientNetB0 provided the best trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. Overall, the results indicate that under limited data conditions, parametric efficiency plays a more critical role than model depth alone.</description>

      <title>VLANeXt: Recipes for Building Strong VLA Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the rise of large foundation models, Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) emerged, leveraging strong visual and language understanding for general-purpose policy learning. Yet, the current VLA landscape remains fragmented and exploratory. Although many groups have proposed their own VLA models, inconsistencies in training protocols and evaluation settings make it difficult to identify which design choices truly matter. To bring structure to this evolving space, we reexamine the VLA design space under a unified framework and evaluation setup. Starting from a simple VLA baseline similar to RT-2 and OpenVLA, we systematically dissect design choices along three dimensions: foundational components, perception essentials, and action modelling perspectives. From this study, we distill 12 key findings that together form a practical recipe for building strong VLA models. The outcome of this exploration is a simple yet effective model, VLANeXt. VLANeXt outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on the LIBERO and LIBERO-plus benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization in real-world experiments. We will release a unified, easy-to-use codebase that serves as a common platform for the community to reproduce our findings, explore the design space, and build new VLA variants on top of a shared foundation.</description>

      <title>Morphological Addressing of Identity Basins in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that morphological pressure creates navigable gradients at multiple levels of the text-to-image generative pipeline. In Study~1, identity basins in Stable Diffusion 1.5 can be navigated using morphological descriptors -- constituent features like platinum blonde,'' beauty mark,'' and 1950s glamour'' -- without the target's name or photographs. A self-distillation loop (generating synthetic images from descriptor prompts, then training a LoRA on those outputs) achieves consistent convergence toward a specific identity as measured by ArcFace similarity. The trained LoRA creates a local coordinate system shaping not only the target identity but also its inverse: maximal away-conditioning produces eldritch'' structural breakdown in base SD1.5, while the LoRA-equipped model produces ``uncanny valley'' outputs -- coherent but precisely wrong. In Study~2, we extend this to prompt-level morphology. Drawing on phonestheme theory, we generate 200 novel nonsense words from English sound-symbolic clusters (e.g., \emph{cr-}, \emph{sn-}, \emph{-oid}, \emph{-ax}) and find that phonestheme-bearing candidates produce significantly more visually coherent outputs than random controls (mean Purity@1 = 0.371 vs.\ 0.209, p&lt;0.00001p &lt; 0.00001 p&lt;0.00001, Cohen's d=0.55d = 0.55 d=0.55). Three candidates -- \emph{snudgeoid}, \emph{crashax}, and \emph{broomix} -- achieve perfect visual consistency (Purity@1 = 1.0) with zero training data contamination, each generating a distinct, coherent visual identity from phonesthetic structure alone. Together, these studies establish that morphological structure -- whether in feature descriptors or prompt-level phonological form -- creates systematic navigational gradients through diffusion model latent spaces.

      <description>arXiv:2602.18540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Rodent-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to annotate rodent behaviour footage. We evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs, including Gemini-2.5-Pro, Gemini-2.5-Flash and Qwen-VL-Max, using this benchmark and find that none of these models perform strongly enough to be used as an assistant for this task. Our benchmark encompasses diverse datasets spanning multiple behavioral paradigms including social interactions, grooming, scratching, and freezing behaviors, with videos ranging from 10 minutes to 35 minutes in length. We provide two benchmark versions to accommodate varying model capabilities and establish standardized evaluation metrics including second-wise accuracy, macro F1, mean average precision, mutual information, and Matthew's correlation coefficient. While some models show modest performance on certain datasets (notably grooming detection), overall results reveal significant challenges in temporal segmentation, handling extended video sequences, and distinguishing subtle behavioral states. Our analysis identifies key limitations in current MLLMs for scientific video annotation and provides insights for future model development. Rodent-Bench serves as a foundation for tracking progress toward reliable automated behavioral annotation in neuroscience research.</description>

      <title>BloomNet: Exploring Single vs. Multiple Object Annotation for Flower Recognition Using YOLO Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise localization and recognition of flowers are crucial for advancing automated agriculture, particularly in plant phenotyping, crop estimation, and yield monitoring. This paper benchmarks several YOLO architectures such as YOLOv5s, YOLOv8n/s/m, and YOLOv12n for flower object detection under two annotation regimes: single-image single-bounding box (SISBB) and single-image multiple-bounding box (SIMBB). The FloralSix dataset, comprising 2,816 high-resolution photos of six different flower species, is also introduced. It is annotated for both dense (clustered) and sparse (isolated) scenarios. The models were evaluated using Precision, Recall, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) at IoU thresholds of 0.5 (mAP@0.5) and 0.5-0.95 (mAP@0.5:0.95). In SISBB, YOLOv8m (SGD) achieved the best results with Precision 0.956, Recall 0.951, mAP@0.5 0.978, and mAP@0.5:0.95 0.865, illustrating strong accuracy in detecting isolated flowers. With mAP@0.5 0.934 and mAP@0.5:0.95 0.752, YOLOv12n (SGD) outperformed the more complicated SIMBB scenario, proving robustness in dense, multi-object detection. Results show how annotation density, IoU thresholds, and model size interact: recall-optimized models perform better in crowded environments, whereas precision-oriented models perform best in sparse scenarios. In both cases, the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer consistently performed better than alternatives. These density-sensitive sensors are helpful for non-destructive crop analysis, growth tracking, robotic pollination, and stress evaluation.</description>

      <title>Effect of Patch Size on Fine-Tuning Vision Transformers in Two-Dimensional and Three-Dimensional Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) and their variants have become state-of-the-art in many computer vision tasks and are widely used as backbones in large-scale vision and vision-language foundation models. While substantial research has focused on architectural improvements, the impact of patch size, a crucial initial design choice in ViTs, remains underexplored, particularly in medical domains where both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) imaging modalities exist.
  In this study, using 12 medical imaging datasets from various imaging modalities (including seven 2D and five 3D datasets), we conduct a thorough evaluation of how different patch sizes affect ViT classification performance. Using a single graphical processing unit (GPU) and a range of patch sizes (1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28), we fine-tune ViT models and observe consistent improvements in classification performance with smaller patch sizes (1, 2, and 4), which achieve the best results across nearly all datasets. More specifically, our results indicate improvements in balanced accuracy of up to 12.78% for 2D datasets (patch size 2 vs. 28) and up to 23.78% for 3D datasets (patch size 1 vs. 14), at the cost of increased computational expense. Moreover, by applying a straightforward ensemble strategy that fuses the predictions of the models trained with patch sizes 1, 2, and 4, we demonstrate a further boost in performance in most cases, especially for the 2D datasets. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/HealMaDe/MedViT</description>

      <title>Narrating For You: Prompt-guided Audio-visual Narrating Face Generation Employing Multi-entangled Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for generating realistic speaking and talking faces by synthesizing a person's voice and facial movements from a static image, a voice profile, and a target text. The model encodes the prompt/driving text, the driving image, and the voice profile of an individual and then combines them to pass them to the multi-entangled latent space to foster key-value pairs and queries for the audio and video modality generation pipeline. The multi-entangled latent space is responsible for establishing the spatiotemporal person-specific features between the modalities. Further, entangled features are passed to the respective decoder of each modality for output audio and video generation.</description>

      <title>Deep LoRA-Unfolding Networks for Image Restoration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep unfolding networks (DUNs), combining conventional iterative optimization algorithms and deep neural networks into a multi-stage framework, have achieved remarkable accomplishments in Image Restoration (IR), such as spectral imaging reconstruction, compressive sensing and super-resolution.It unfolds the iterative optimization steps into a stack of sequentially linked blocks.Each block consists of a Gradient Descent Module (GDM) and a Proximal Mapping Module (PMM) which is equivalent to a denoiser from a Bayesian perspective, operating on Gaussian noise with a known level.However, existing DUNs suffer from two critical limitations: (i) their PMMs share identical architectures and denoising objectives across stages, ignoring the need for stage-specific adaptation to varying noise levels; and (ii) their chain of structurally repetitive blocks results in severe parameter redundancy and high memory consumption, hindering deployment in large-scale or resource-constrained scenarios.To address these challenges, we introduce generalized Deep Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) Unfolding Networks for image restoration, named LoRun, harmonizing denoising objectives and adapting different denoising levels between stages with compressed memory usage for more efficient DUN.LoRun introduces a novel paradigm where a single pretrained base denoiser is shared across all stages, while lightweight, stage-specific LoRA adapters are injected into the PMMs to dynamically modulate denoising behavior according to the noise level at each unfolding step.This design decouples the core restoration capability from task-specific adaptation, enabling precise control over denoising intensity without duplicating full network parameters and achieving up to $N$ times parameter reduction for an $N$-stage DUN with on-par or better performance.Extensive experiments conducted on three IR tasks validate the efficiency of our method.</description>

      <title>Think with Grounding: Curriculum Reinforced Reasoning with Video Grounding for Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long video understanding is challenging due to rich and complicated multimodal clues in long temporal range.Current methods adopt reasoning to improve the model's ability to analyze complex video clues in long videos via text-form reasoning.However,the existing literature suffers from the fact that the text-only reasoning under fixed video context may exacerbate hallucinations since detailed crucial clues are often ignored under limited video context length due to the temporal redundancy of long videos.To address this gap,we propose Video-TwG,a curriculum reinforced framework that employs a novel Think-with-Grounding paradigm,enabling video LLMs to actively decide when to perform on-demand grounding during interleaved text-video reasoning, selectively zooming into question-relevant clips only when necessary.Video-TwG can be trained end-to-end in a straightforward manner, without relying on complex auxiliary modules or heavily annotated reasoning tracesIn detail,we design a Two-stage Reinforced Curriculum Strategy, where the model first learns think-with-grounding behavior on a small short-video GQA dataset with grounding labels,and then scales to diverse general QA data with videos of diverse domains to encourage generalization. Further, to handle complex think-with-grounding reasoning for various kinds of data,we propose TwG-GRPO algorithm which features the fine-grained grounding reward, self-confirmed pseudo reward and accuracy-gated mechanism.Finally,we propose to construct a new TwG-51K dataset that facilitates training. Experiments on Video-MME, LongVideoBench, and MLVU show that Video-TwG consistently outperforms strong LVU baselines.Further ablation validates the necessity of our Two-stage Reinforced Curriculum Strategy and shows our TwG-GRPO better leverages diverse unlabeled data to improve grounding quality and reduce redundant groundings without sacrificing QA performance.</description>

      <title>IRIS-SLAM: Unified Geo-Instance Representations for Robust Semantic Localization and Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometry foundation models have significantly advanced dense geometric SLAM, yet existing systems often lack deep semantic understanding and robust loop closure capabilities. Meanwhile, contemporary semantic mapping approaches are frequently hindered by decoupled architectures and fragile data association. We propose IRIS-SLAM, a novel RGB semantic SLAM system that leverages unified geometric-instance representations derived from an instance-extended foundation model. By extending a geometry foundation model to concurrently predict dense geometry and cross-view consistent instance embeddings, we enable a semantic-synergized association mechanism and instance-guided loop closure detection. Our approach effectively utilizes viewpoint-agnostic semantic anchors to bridge the gap between geometric reconstruction and open-vocabulary mapping. Experimental results demonstrate that IRIS-SLAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in map consistency and wide-baseline loop closure reliability.</description>

      <title>HIME: Mitigating Object Hallucinations in LVLMs via Hallucination Insensitivity Model Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal understanding capabilities, yet they remain prone to object hallucination, where models describe non-existent objects or attribute incorrect factual information, raising serious concerns for reliable real-world deployment. While fine-tuning is a commonly adopted mitigation strategy, its high computational cost and practical difficulty motivate the need for training-free alternatives, among which model editing has recently emerged as a promising direction. However, indiscriminate editing risks disrupting the rich implicit knowledge encoded in pre-trained LVLMs, leading to a fundamental question: how much intervention is necessary at each layer to suppress hallucinations while preserving pre-trained knowledge? To address this question, we present a systematic analysis of LVLM decoders built on three widely used large language model backbones-Qwen, LLaMA, and Vicuna-revealing clear layer-wise differences in susceptibility to object hallucination. Building on these insights, we introduce the Hallucination Insensitivity Score (HIS), a principled metric that quantifies each layer's sensitivity to hallucination and provides guidance for targeted intervention. Leveraging HIS, we propose Hallucination Insensitivity Model Editing (HIME), a simple yet effective layer-adaptive weight editing approach that selectively modifies latent features to suppress hallucinations while preserving pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIME reduces hallucinations by an average of 61.8% across open-ended generation benchmarks, including CHAIR, MME, and GPT-4V-aided evaluation, without introducing additional parameters, inference-time latency, or computational overhead.</description>

      <title>NeXt2Former-CD: Efficient Remote Sensing Change Detection with Modern Vision Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have recently gained traction in remote sensing change detection (CD) for their favorable scaling properties. In this paper, we explore the potential of modern convolutional and attention-based architectures as a competitive alternative. We propose NeXt2Former-CD, an end-to-end framework that integrates a Siamese ConvNeXt encoder initialized with DINOv3 weights, a deformable attention-based temporal fusion module, and a Mask2Former decoder. This design is intended to better tolerate residual co-registration noise and small object-level spatial shifts, as well as semantic ambiguity in bi-temporal imagery. Experiments on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and CDD datasets show that our method achieves the best results among the evaluated methods, improving over recent Mamba-based baselines in both F1 score and IoU. Furthermore, despite a larger parameter count, our model maintains inference latency comparable to SSM-based approaches, suggesting it is practical for high-resolution change detection tasks.</description>

      <title>Subtle Motion Blur Detection and Segmentation from Static Image Artworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Streaming services serve hundreds of millions of viewers worldwide, where visual assets such as thumbnails, box art, and cover images are critical for engagement. Subtle motion blur remains a pervasive quality issue, reducing visual clarity and negatively affecting user trust and click-through rates. However, motion blur detection from static images is underexplored, as existing methods and datasets focus on severe blur and lack fine-grained pixel-level annotations needed for quality-critical applications. Benchmarks such as GOPRO and NFS are dominated by strong synthetic blur and often contain residual blur in their sharp references, leading to ambiguous supervision. We propose SMBlurDetect, a unified framework combining high-quality motion blur specific dataset generation with an end-to-end detector capable of zero-shot detection at multiple granularities. Our pipeline synthesizes realistic motion blur from super high resolution aesthetic images using controllable camera and object motion simulations over SAM segmented regions, enhanced with alpha-aware compositing and balanced sampling to generate subtle, spatially localized blur with precise ground truth masks. We train a U-Net based detector with ImageNet pretrained encoders using a hybrid mask and image centric strategy incorporating curriculum learning, hard negatives, focal loss, blur frequency channels, and resolution aware augmentation.Our method achieves strong zero-shot generalization, reaching 89.68% accuracy on GoPro (vs 66.50% baseline) and 59.77% Mean IoU on CUHK (vs 9.00% baseline), demonstrating 6.6x improvement in segmentation. Qualitative results show accurate localization of subtle blur artifacts, enabling automated filtering of low quality frames and precise region of interest extraction for intelligent cropping.</description>

      <title>WiCompass: Oracle-driven Data Scaling for mmWave Human Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave Human Pose Estimation (mmWave HPE) promises privacy but suffers from poor generalization under distribution shifts. We demonstrate that brute-force data scaling is ineffective for out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness; efficiency and coverage are the true bottlenecks. To address this, we introduce WiCompass, a coverage-aware data-collection framework. WiCompass leverages large-scale motion-capture corpora to build a universal pose space ``oracle'' that quantifies dataset redundancy and identifies underrepresented motions. Guided by this oracle, WiCompass employs a closed-loop policy to prioritize collecting informative missing samples. Experiments show that WiCompass consistently improves OOD accuracy at matched budgets and exhibits superior scaling behavior compared to conventional collection strategies. By shifting focus from brute-force scaling to coverage-aware data acquisition, this work offers a practical path toward robust mmWave sensing.</description>

      <title>MiSCHiEF: A Benchmark in Minimal-Pairs of Safety and Culture for Holistic Evaluation of Fine-Grained Image-Caption Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-grained image-caption alignment is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs), especially in socially critical contexts such as identifying real-world risk scenarios or distinguishing cultural proxies, where correct interpretation hinges on subtle visual or linguistic clues and where minor misinterpretations can lead to significant real-world consequences. We present MiSCHiEF, a set of two benchmarking datasets based on a contrastive pair design in the domains of safety (MiS) and culture (MiC), and evaluate four VLMs on tasks requiring fine-grained differentiation of paired images and captions. In both datasets, each sample contains two minimally differing captions and corresponding minimally differing images. In MiS, the image-caption pairs depict a safe and an unsafe scenario, while in MiC, they depict cultural proxies in two distinct cultural contexts. We find that models generally perform better at confirming the correct image-caption pair than rejecting incorrect ones. Additionally, models achieve higher accuracy when selecting the correct caption from two highly similar captions for a given image, compared to the converse task. The results, overall, highlight persistent modality misalignment challenges in current VLMs, underscoring the difficulty of precise cross-modal grounding required for applications with subtle semantic and visual distinctions.</description>

      <title>LaS-Comp: Zero-shot 3D Completion with Latent-Spatial Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces LaS-Comp, a zero-shot and category-agnostic approach that leverages the rich geometric priors of 3D foundation models to enable 3D shape completion across diverse types of partial observations. Our contributions are threefold: First, \ourname{} harnesses these powerful generative priors for completion through a complementary two-stage design: (i) an explicit replacement stage that preserves the partial observation geometry to ensure faithful completion; and (ii) an implicit refinement stage ensures seamless boundaries between the observed and synthesized regions. Second, our framework is training-free and compatible with different 3D foundation models. Third, we introduce Omni-Comp, a comprehensive benchmark combining real-world and synthetic data with diverse and challenging partial patterns, enabling a more thorough and realistic evaluation. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our code and data will be available at \href{https://github.com/DavidYan2001/LaS-Comp}{LaS-Comp}. </description>

      <title>Synthesizing Multimodal Geometry Datasets from Scratch and Enabling Visual Alignment via Plotting Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal geometry reasoning requires models to jointly understand visual diagrams and perform structured symbolic inference, yet current vision--language models struggle with complex geometric constructions due to limited training data and weak visual--symbolic alignment. We propose a pipeline for synthesizing complex multimodal geometry problems from scratch and construct a dataset named \textbf{GeoCode}, which decouples problem generation into symbolic seed construction, grounded instantiation with verification, and code-based diagram rendering, ensuring consistency across structure, text, reasoning, and images. Leveraging the plotting code provided in GeoCode, we further introduce code prediction as an explicit alignment objective, transforming visual understanding into a supervised structured prediction task. GeoCode exhibits substantially higher structural complexity and reasoning difficulty than existing benchmarks, while maintaining mathematical correctness through multi-stage validation.

      <title>MIRROR: Multimodal Iterative Reasoning via Reflection on Visual Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), enhancing multimodal reasoning capabilities remains a critical challenge, particularly in handling ambiguous or complex visual inputs, where initial inferences often lead to hallucinations or logic errors. Existing VLMs often produce plausible yet ungrounded answers, and even when prompted to "reflect", their corrections may remain detached from the image evidence. To address this, we propose the MIRROR framework for Multimodal Iterative Reasoning via Reflection On visual Regions. By embedding visual reflection as a core mechanism, MIRROR is formulated as a closed-loop process comprising draft, critique, region-based verification, and revision, which are repeated until the output is visually grounded. To facilitate training of this model, we construct **ReflectV**, a visual reflective dataset for multi-turn supervision that explicitly contains reflection triggers, region-based verification actions, and answer revision grounded in visual evidence. Experiments on both general vision-language benchmarks and representative vision-language reasoning benchmarks show that MIRROR improves correctness and reduces visual hallucinations, demonstrating the value of training reflection as an evidence-seeking, region-aware verification process rather than a purely textual revision step.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Computational Pathology Foundation Models For Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, foundation models such as CLIP, DINO,and CONCH have demonstrated remarkable domain generalization and unsupervised feature extraction capabilities across diverse imaging tasks. However, systematic and independent evaluations of these models for pixel-level semantic segmentation in histopathology remain scarce. In this study, we propose a robust benchmarking approach to asses 10 foundational models on four histopathological datasets covering both morphological tissue-region and cellular/nuclear segmentation tasks. Our method leverages attention maps of foundation models as pixel-wise features, which are then classified using a machine learning algorithm, XGBoost, enabling fast, interpretable, and model-agnostic evaluation without finetuning. We show that the vision language foundation model, CONCH performed the best across datasets when compared to vision-only foundation models, with PathDino as close second. Further analysis shows that models trained on distinct histopathology cohorts capture complementary morphological representations, and concatenating their features yields superior segmentation performance. Concatenating features from CONCH, PathDino and CellViT outperformed individual models across all the datasets by 7.95% (averaged across the datasets), suggesting that ensembles of foundation models can better generalize to diverse histopathological segmentation tasks.</description>

      <title>Optimizing ID Consistency in Multimodal Large Models: Facial Restoration via Alignment, Entanglement, and Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal editing large models have demonstrated powerful editing capabilities across diverse tasks. However, a persistent and long-standing limitation is the decline in facial identity (ID) consistency during realistic portrait editing. Due to the human eye's high sensitivity to facial features, such inconsistency significantly hinders the practical deployment of these models. Current facial ID preservation methods struggle to achieve consistent restoration of both facial identity and edited element IP due to Cross-source Distribution Bias and Cross-source Feature Contamination. To address these issues, we propose EditedID, an Alignment-Disentanglement-Entanglement framework for robust identity-specific facial restoration. By systematically analyzing diffusion trajectories, sampler behaviors, and attention properties, we introduce three key components: 1) Adaptive mixing strategy that aligns cross-source latent representations throughout the diffusion process. 2) Hybrid solver that disentangles source-specific identity attributes and details. 3) Attentional gating mechanism that selectively entangles visual elements. Extensive experiments show that EditedID achieves state-of-the-art performance in preserving original facial ID and edited element IP consistency. As a training-free and plug-and-play solution, it establishes a new benchmark for practical and reliable single/multi-person facial identity restoration in open-world settings, paving the way for the deployment of multimodal editing large models in real-person editing scenarios.

      <title>Driving with A Thousand Faces: A Benchmark for Closed-Loop Personalized End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human driving behavior is inherently diverse, yet most end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) systems learn a single average driving style, neglecting individual differences. Achieving personalized E2E-AD faces challenges across three levels: limited real-world datasets with individual-level annotations, a lack of quantitative metrics for evaluating personal driving styles, and the absence of algorithms that can learn stylized representations from users' trajectories. To address these gaps, we propose Person2Drive, a comprehensive personalized E2E-AD platform and benchmark. It includes an open-source, flexible data collection system that simulates realistic scenarios to generate scalable and diverse personalized driving datasets; style vector-based evaluation metrics with Maximum Mean Discrepancy and KL divergence to comprehensively quantify individual driving behaviors; and a personalized E2E-AD framework with a style reward model that efficiently adapts E2E models for safe and individualized driving. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Person2Drive enables fine-grained analysis, reproducible evaluation, and effective personalization in end-to-end autonomous driving. Our dataset and code will be released after acceptance.</description>

      <title>TAG: Thinking with Action Unit Grounding for Facial Expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is a fine-grained visual understanding task where reliable predictions require reasoning over localized and meaningful facial cues. Recent vision--language models (VLMs) enable natural language explanations for FER, but their reasoning is often ungrounded, producing fluent yet unverifiable rationales that are weakly tied to visual evidence and prone to hallucination, leading to poor robustness across different datasets. We propose TAG (Thinking with Action Unit Grounding), a vision--language framework that explicitly constrains multimodal reasoning to be supported by facial Action Units (AUs). TAG requires intermediate reasoning steps to be grounded in AU-related facial regions, yielding predictions accompanied by verifiable visual evidence. The model is trained via supervised fine-tuning on AU-grounded reasoning traces followed by reinforcement learning with an AU-aware reward that aligns predicted regions with external AU detectors. Evaluated on RAF-DB, FERPlus, and AffectNet, TAG consistently outperforms strong open-source and closed-source VLM baselines while simultaneously improving visual faithfulness. Ablation and preference studies further show that AU-grounded rewards stabilize reasoning and mitigate hallucination, demonstrating the importance of structured grounded intermediate representations for trustworthy multimodal reasoning in FER. The code will be available at https://github.com/would1920/FER_TAG .</description>

      <title>A high-resolution nationwide urban village mapping product for 342 Chinese cities based on foundation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban Villages (UVs) represent a distinctive form of high-density informal settlement embedded within China's rapidly urbanizing cities. Accurate identification of UVs is critical for urban governance, renewal, and sustainable development. But due to the pronounced heterogeneity and diversity of UVs across China's vast territory, a consistent and reliable nationwide dataset has been lacking. In this work, we present GeoLink-UV, a high-resolution nationwide UV mapping product that clearly delineates the locations and boundaries of UVs in 342 Chinese cities. The dataset is derived from multisource geospatial data, including optical remote sensing images and geo-vector data, and is generated through a foundation model-driven mapping framework designed to address the generalization issues and improve the product quality. A geographically stratified accuracy assessment based on independent samples from 28 cities confirms the reliability and scientific credibility of the nationwide dataset across heterogeneous urban contexts. Based on this nationwide product, we reveal substantial interregional disparities in UV prevalence and spatial configuration. On average, UV areas account for 8 % of built-up land, with marked clustering in central and south China. Building-level analysis further confirms a consistent low-rise, high-density development pattern of UVs nationwide, while highlighting regionally differentiated morphological characteristics. The GeoLink-UV dataset provides an open and systematically validated geospatial foundation for urban studies, informal settlement monitoring, and evidence-based urban renewal planning, and contributes directly to large-scale assessments aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 11. The GeoLink-UV dataset introduced in this article is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18688062.</description>

      <title>Initialization matters in few-shot adaptation of vision-language models for histopathological image classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision language models (VLM) pre-trained on datasets of histopathological image-caption pairs enabled zero-shot slide-level classification. The ability of VLM image encoders to extract discriminative features also opens the door for supervised fine-tuning for whole-slide image (WSI) classification, ideally using few labeled samples. Slide-level prediction frameworks require the incorporation of multiple instance learning (MIL) due to the gigapixel size of the WSI. Following patch-level feature extraction and aggregation, MIL frameworks rely on linear classifiers trained on top of the slide-level aggregated features. Classifier weight initialization has a large influence on Linear Probing performance in efficient transfer learning (ETL) approaches based on few-shot learning. In this work, we propose Zero-Shot Multiple-Instance Learning (ZS-MIL) to address the limitations of random classifier initialization that underperform zero-shot prediction in MIL problems. ZS-MIL uses the class-level embeddings of the VLM text encoder as the classification layer's starting point to compute each sample's bag-level probabilities. Through multiple experiments, we demonstrate the robustness of ZS-MIL compared to well-known weight initialization techniques both in terms of performance and variability in an ETL few-shot scenario for subtyping prediction.</description>

      <title>MaskDiME: Adaptive Masked Diffusion for Precise and Efficient Visual Counterfactual Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual counterfactual explanations aim to reveal the minimal semantic modifications that can alter a model's prediction, providing causal and interpretable insights into deep neural networks. However, existing diffusion-based counterfactual generation methods are often computationally expensive, slow to sample, and imprecise in localizing the modified regions. To address these limitations, we propose MaskDiME, a simple, fast, and effective diffusion framework that unifies semantic consistency and spatial precision through localized sampling. Our approach adaptively focuses on decision-relevant regions to achieve localized and semantically consistent counterfactual generation while preserving high image fidelity. Our training-free framework, MaskDiME, achieves over 30x faster inference than the baseline method and achieves comparable or state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets spanning diverse visual domains, establishing a practical and generalizable solution for efficient counterfactual explanation.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Preference Alignment for Diffusion Models with Classifier-Free Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning large-scale text-to-image diffusion models with nuanced human preferences remains challenging. While direct preference optimization (DPO) is simple and effective, large-scale finetuning often shows a generalization gap. We take inspiration from test-time guidance and cast preference alignment as classifier-free guidance (CFG): a finetuned preference model acts as an external control signal during sampling. Building on this view, we propose a simple method that improves alignment without retraining the base model. To further enhance generalization, we decouple preference learning into two modules trained on positive and negative data, respectively, and form a \emph{contrastive guidance} vector at inference by subtracting their predictions (positive minus negative), scaled by a user-chosen strength and added to the base prediction at each step. This yields a sharper and controllable alignment signal. We evaluate on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and Stable Diffusion XL with Pick-a-Pic v2 and HPDv3, showing consistent quantitative and qualitative gains.</description>

      <title>Learning Multi-Modal Prototypes for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) aims to detect novel classes in unseen target domains given only a few labeled examples. While open-vocabulary detectors built on vision-language models (VLMs) transfer well, they depend almost entirely on text prompts, which encode domain-invariant semantics but miss domain-specific visual information needed for precise localization under few-shot supervision. We propose a dual-branch detector that Learns Multi-modal Prototypes, dubbed LMP, by coupling textual guidance with visual exemplars drawn from the target domain. A Visual Prototype Construction module aggregates class-level prototypes from support RoIs and dynamically generates hard-negative prototypes in query images via jittered boxes, capturing distractors and visually similar backgrounds. In the visual-guided branch, we inject these prototypes into the detection pipeline with components mirrored from the text branch as the starting point for training, while a parallel text-guided branch preserves open-vocabulary semantics. The branches are trained jointly and ensembled at inference by combining semantic abstraction with domain-adaptive details. On six cross-domain benchmark datasets and standard 1/5/10-shot settings, our method achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive mAP.</description>

      <title>HeRO: Hierarchical 3D Semantic Representation for Pose-aware Object Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation has progressed from 2D image policies to 3D representations that explicitly encode geometry. Yet purely geometric policies often lack explicit part-level semantics, which are critical for pose-aware manipulation (e.g., distinguishing a shoe's toe from heel). In this paper, we present HeRO, a diffusion-based policy that couples geometry and semantics via hierarchical semantic fields. HeRO employs dense semantics lifting to fuse discriminative, geometry-sensitive features from DINOv2 with the smooth, globally coherent correspondences from Stable Diffusion, yielding dense features that are both fine-grained and spatially consistent. These features are processed and partitioned to construct a global field and a set of local fields. A hierarchical conditioning module conditions the generative denoiser on global and local fields using permutation-invariant network architecture, thereby avoiding order-sensitive bias and producing a coherent control policy for pose-aware manipulation. In various tests, HeRO establishes a new state-of-the-art, improving success on Place Dual Shoes by 12.3% and averaging 6.5% gains across six challenging pose-aware tasks.

      <title>Robust Self-Supervised Cross-Modal Super-Resolution against Real-World Misaligned Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cross-modal super-resolution (SR) on real-world misaligned data, where only a limited number of low-resolution (LR) source and high-resolution (HR) guide image pairs with complex spatial misalignments are available. To address this challenge, we propose RobSelf--a fully self-supervised model that is optimized online, requiring no training data, ground-truth supervision, or pre-alignment. RobSelf features two key techniques: a misalignment-aware feature translator and a content-aware reference filter. The translator reformulates unsupervised cross-modal and cross-resolution alignment as a weakly-supervised, misalignment-aware translation subtask, producing an aligned guide feature with inherent redundancy. Guided by this feature, the filter performs reference-based discriminative self-enhancement on the source, enabling SR predictions with high resolution and high fidelity. Across a variety of tasks, we demonstrate that RobSelf achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior efficiency. Additionally, we introduce a real-world dataset, RealMisSR, to advance research on this topic. Dataset and code: https://github.com/palmdong/RobSelf.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Temporal State Propagation Autoregressive Model for 4D Object Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating high-quality 4D objects with spatial-temporal consistency is still formidable. Existing diffusion-based methods often struggle with spatial-temporal inconsistency, as they fail to leverage outputs from all previous timesteps to guide the generation at the current timestep. Therefore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal State Propagation AutoRegressive Model (4DSTAR), which generates 4D objects maintaining temporal-spatial consistency. 4DSTAR formulates the generation problem as the prediction of tokens that represent the 4D object. It consists of two key components: (1) The dynamic spatial-temporal state propagation autoregressive model (STAR) is proposed, which achieves spatial-temporal consistent generation. Unlike standard autoregressive models, STAR divides prediction tokens into groups based on timesteps. It models long-term dependencies by propagating spatial-temporal states from previous groups and utilizes these dependencies to guide generation at the next timestep. To this end, a spatial-temporal container is proposed, which dynamically updating the effective spatial-temporal state features from all historical groups, then updated features serve as conditional features to guide the prediction of the next token group. (2) The 4D VQ-VAE is proposed, which implicitly encodes the 4D structure into discrete space and decodes the discrete tokens predicted by STAR into temporally coherent dynamic 3D Gaussians. Experiments demonstrate that 4DSTAR generates spatial-temporal consistent 4D objects, and achieves performance competitive with diffusion models.</description>

      <title>IDperturb: Enhancing Variation in Synthetic Face Generation via Angular Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a practical alternative to authentic face datasets for training face recognition (FR) systems, especially as privacy and legal concerns increasingly restrict the use of real biometric data. Recent advances in identity-conditional diffusion models have enabled the generation of photorealistic and identity-consistent face images. However, many of these models suffer from limited intra-class variation, an essential property for training robust and generalizable FR models. In this work, we propose IDPERTURB, a simple yet effective geometric-driven sampling strategy to enhance diversity in synthetic face generation. IDPERTURB perturbs identity embeddings within a constrained angular region of the unit hyper-sphere, producing a diverse set of embeddings without modifying the underlying generative model. Each perturbed embedding serves as a conditioning vector for a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling the synthesis of visually varied yet identity-coherent face images suitable for training generalizable FR systems. Empirical results demonstrate that training FR on datasets generated using IDPERTURB yields improved performance across multiple FR benchmarks, compared to existing synthetic data generation approaches.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks have remarkably progressed the performance of distinguishing plant diseases, severity grading, and nutrition deficiency prediction using leaf images. However, these tasks become more challenging in a realistic in-situ field condition. Often, a traditional machine learning model may fail to capture and interpret discriminative characteristics of plant health, growth and diseases due to subtle variations within leaf subcategories. A few deep learning methods have used additional preprocessing stages or network modules to address the problem, whereas several other methods have utilized pre-trained backbone CNNs, most of which are computationally intensive. Therefore, to address the challenge, we propose a lightweight autoencoder using separable convolutional layers in its encoder decoder blocks. A sigmoid gating is applied for refining the prowess of the encoders feature discriminability, which is improved further by the decoder. Finally, the feature maps of the encoder decoder are combined for rich feature representation before classification. The proposed Convolutional Lightweight Autoencoder for Plant disease classification, called CLAP, has been experimented on three public plant datasets consisting of cassava, tomato, maize, groundnut, grapes, etc. for determining plant health conditions. The CLAP has attained improved or competitive accuracies on the Integrated Plant Disease, Groundnut, and CCMT datasets balancing a tradeoff between the performance, and little computational cost requiring 5 million parameters. The training time is 20 milliseconds and inference time is 1 ms per image.</description>

      <title>Detecting AI-Generated Forgeries via Iterative Manifold Deviation Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of highly realistic AI-generated images poses critical challenges for digital forensics, demanding precise pixel-level localization of manipulated regions. Existing methods predominantly learn discriminative patterns of specific forgeries and often struggle with novel manipulations as editing techniques continue to evolve. We propose the Iterative Forgery Amplifier Network (IFA-Net), which shifts from learning "what is fake" to modeling "what is real". Grounded in the principle that all manipulations deviate from the natural image manifold, IFA-Net leverages a frozen Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretrained on real images as a universal realness prior. Our framework operates through a two-stage closed-loop process: an initial Dual-Stream Segmentation Network (DSSN) fuses the original image with MAE reconstruction residuals for coarse localization, followed by a Task-Adaptive Prior Injection (TAPI) module that converts this coarse prediction into guiding prompts to steer the MAE decoder and amplify reconstruction failures in suspicious regions for precise refinement. Extensive experiments on four diffusion-based inpainting benchmarks show that IFA-Net achieves an average improvement of 6.5% in IoU and 8.1% in F1-score over the second-best method, while demonstrating strong generalization to traditional manipulation types.</description>

      <title>Echoes of Ownership: Adversarial-Guided Dual Injection for Copyright Protection in MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid deployment and widespread adoption of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), disputes regarding model version attribution and ownership have become increasingly frequent, raising significant concerns about intellectual property protection. In this paper, we propose a framework for generating copyright triggers for MLLMs, enabling model publishers to embed verifiable ownership information into the model. The goal is to construct trigger images that elicit ownership-related textual responses exclusively in fine-tuned derivatives of the original model, while remaining inert in other non-derivative models. Our method constructs a tracking trigger image by treating the image as a learnable tensor, performing adversarial optimization with dual-injection of ownership-relevant semantic information. The first injection is achieved by enforcing textual consistency between the output of an auxiliary MLLM and a predefined ownership-relevant target text; the consistency loss is backpropagated to inject this ownership-related information into the image. The second injection is performed at the semantic-level by minimizing the distance between the CLIP features of the image and those of the target text. Furthermore, we introduce an additional adversarial training stage involving the auxiliary model derived from the original model itself. This auxiliary model is specifically trained to resist generating ownership-relevant target text, thereby enhancing robustness in heavily fine-tuned derivative models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual-injection approach in tracking model lineage under various fine-tuning and domain-shift scenarios.</description>

      <title>DUET-VLM: Dual stage Unified Efficient Token reduction for VLM Training and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities, yet remain computationally expensive due to dense visual tokenization. Existing efficiency approaches either merge redundant visual tokens or drop them progressively in language backbone, often trading accuracy for speed. In this work, we propose DUET-VLM, a versatile plug-and-play dual compression framework that consists of (a) vision-only redundancy aware compression of vision encoder's output into information-preserving tokens, followed by (b) layer-wise, salient text-guided dropping of visual tokens within the language backbone to progressively prune less informative tokens. This coordinated token management enables aggressive compression while retaining critical semantics. On LLaVA-1.5-7B, our approach maintains over 99% of baseline accuracy with 67% fewer tokens, and still retains &gt;97% even at 89% reduction. With this dual-stage compression during training, it achieves 99.7% accuracy at 67% and 97.6% at 89%, surpassing prior SoTA visual token reduction methods across multiple benchmarks. When integrated into Video-LLaVA-7B, it even surpasses the baseline -- achieving &gt;100% accuracy with a substantial 53.1% token reduction and retaining 97.6% accuracy under an extreme 93.4% setting. These results highlight end-to-end training with DUET-VLM, enabling robust adaptation to reduced visual (image/video) input without sacrificing accuracy, producing compact yet semantically rich representations within the same computational budget. Our code is available at https://github.com/AMD-AGI/DUET-VLM.</description>

      <title>Open-Vocabulary Domain Generalization in Urban-Scene Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain Generalization in Semantic Segmentation (DG-SS) aims to enable segmentation models to perform robustly in unseen environments. However, conventional DG-SS methods are restricted to a fixed set of known categories, limiting their applicability in open-world scenarios. Recent progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has advanced Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OV-SS) by enabling models to recognize a broader range of concepts. Yet, these models remain sensitive to domain shifts and struggle to maintain robustness when deployed in unseen environments, a challenge that is particularly severe in urban-driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Open-Vocabulary Domain Generalization in Semantic Segmentation (OVDG-SS), a new setting that jointly addresses unseen domains and unseen categories. We introduce the first benchmark for OVDG-SS in autonomous driving, addressing a previously unexplored problem and covering both synthetic-to-real and real-to-real generalization across diverse unseen domains and unseen categories. In OVDG-SS, we observe that domain shifts often distort text-image correlations in pre-trained VLMs, which hinders the performance of OV-SS models. To tackle this challenge, we propose S2-Corr, a state-space-driven text-image correlation refinement mechanism that mitigates domain-induced distortions and produces more consistent text-image correlations under distribution changes. Extensive experiments on our constructed benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior cross-domain performance and efficiency compared to existing OV-SS approaches.</description>

      <title>Joint Post-Training Quantization of Vision Transformers with Learned Prompt-Guided Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for end-to-end joint quantization of Vision Transformers trained on ImageNet for the purpose of image classification. Unlike prior post-training or block-wise reconstruction methods, we jointly optimize over the entire set of all layers and inter-block dependencies without any labeled data, scaling effectively with the number of samples and completing in just one hour on a single GPU for ViT-small. We achieve state-of-the-art W4A4 and W3A3 accuracies on ImageNet and, to the best of our knowledge, the first PTQ results that maintain strong accuracy on ViT, DeiT, and Swin-T models under extremely low-bit settings (W1.58A8), demonstrating the potential for efficient edge deployment. Furthermore, we introduce a data-free calibration strategy that synthesizes diverse, label-free samples using Stable Diffusion Turbo guided by learned multi-mode prompts. By encouraging diversity in both the learned prompt embeddings and the generated image features, our data-free approach achieves performance on par with real-data ImageNet calibration and surpasses simple text-prompt baselines such as "a &lt;adjective&gt; photo of &lt;adjective&gt; &lt;cls&gt;".</description>

      <title>Similarity-as-Evidence: Calibrating Overconfident VLMs for Interpretable and Label-Efficient Medical Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Learning (AL) reduces annotation costs in medical imaging by selecting only the most informative samples for labeling, but suffers from cold-start when labeled data are scarce. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) address the cold-start problem via zero-shot predictions, yet their temperature-scaled softmax outputs treat text-image similarities as deterministic scores while ignoring inherent uncertainty, leading to overconfidence. This overconfidence misleads sample selection, wasting annotation budgets on uninformative cases. To overcome these limitations, the Similarity-as-Evidence (SaE) framework calibrates text-image similarities by introducing a Similarity Evidence Head (SEH), which reinterprets the similarity vector as evidence and parameterizes a Dirichlet distribution over labels. In contrast to a standard softmax that enforces confident predictions even under weak signals, the Dirichlet formulation explicitly quantifies lack of evidence (vacuity) and conflicting evidence (dissonance), thereby mitigating overconfidence caused by rigid softmax normalization. Building on this, SaE employs a dual-factor acquisition strategy: high-vacuity samples (e.g., rare diseases) are prioritized in early rounds to ensure coverage, while high-dissonance samples (e.g., ambiguous diagnoses) are prioritized later to refine boundaries, providing clinically interpretable selection rationales. Experiments on ten public medical imaging datasets with a 20% label budget show that SaE attains state-of-the-art macro-averaged accuracy of 82.57%. On the representative BTMRI dataset, SaE also achieves superior calibration, with a negative log-likelihood (NLL) of 0.425.</description>

      <title>Enhancing 3D LiDAR Segmentation by Shaping Dense and Accurate 2D Semantic Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR point clouds is important in urban remote sensing for understanding real-world street environments. This task, by projecting LiDAR point clouds and 3D semantic labels as sparse maps, can be reformulated as a 2D problem. However, the intrinsic sparsity of the projected LiDAR and label maps can result in sparse and inaccurate intermediate 2D semantic predictions, which in return limits the final 3D accuracy. To address this issue, we enhance this task by shaping dense and accurate 2D predictions. Specifically, we develop a multi-modal segmentation model, MM2D3D. By leveraging camera images as auxiliary data, we introduce cross-modal guided filtering to overcome label map sparsity by constraining intermediate 2D semantic predictions with dense semantic relations derived from the camera images; and we introduce dynamic cross pseudo supervision to overcome LiDAR map sparsity by encouraging the 2D predictions to emulate the dense distribution of the semantic predictions from the camera images. Experiments show that our techniques enable our model to achieve intermediate 2D semantic predictions with dense distribution and higher accuracy, which effectively enhances the final 3D accuracy. Comparisons with previous methods demonstrate our superior performance in both 2D and 3D spaces.</description>

      <title>BiMotion: B-spline Motion for Text-guided Dynamic 3D Character Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-guided dynamic 3D character generation has advanced rapidly, yet producing high-quality motion that faithfully reflects rich textual descriptions remains challenging. Existing methods tend to generate limited sub-actions or incoherent motion due to fixed-length temporal inputs and discrete frame-wise representations that fail to capture rich motion semantics. We address these limitations by representing motion with continuous differentiable B-spline curves, enabling more effective motion generation without modifying the capabilities of the underlying generative model. Specifically, our closed-form, Laplacian-regularized B-spline solver efficiently compresses variable-length motion sequences into compact representations with a fixed number of control points. Further, we introduce a normal-fusion strategy for input shape adherence along with correspondence-aware and local-rigidity losses for motion-restoration quality. To train our model, we collate BIMO, a new dataset containing diverse variable-length 3D motion sequences with rich, high-quality text annotations. Extensive evaluations show that our feed-forward framework BiMotion generates more expressive, higher-quality, and better prompt-aligned motions than existing state-of-the-art methods, while also achieving faster generation.

      <title>Structure-Level Disentangled Diffusion for Few-Shot Chinese Font Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot Chinese font generation aims to synthesize new characters in a target style using only a handful of reference images. Achieving accurate content rendering and faithful style transfer requires effective disentanglement between content and style. However, existing approaches achieve only feature-level disentanglement, allowing the generator to re-entangle these features, leading to content distortion and degraded style fidelity. We propose the Structure-Level Disentangled Diffusion Model (SLD-Font), which receives content and style information from two separate channels. SimSun-style images are used as content templates and concatenated with noisy latent features as the input. Style features extracted by a CLIP model from target-style images are integrated via cross-attention. Additionally, we train a Background Noise Removal module in the pixel space to remove background noise in complex stroke regions. Based on theoretical validation of disentanglement effectiveness, we introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that updates only the style-related modules. This allows the model to better adapt to new styles while avoiding overfitting to the reference images' content. We further introduce the Grey and OCR metrics to evaluate the content quality of generated characters. Experimental results show that SLD-Font achieves significantly higher style fidelity while maintaining comparable content accuracy to existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>FOCA: Frequency-Oriented Cross-Domain Forgery Detection, Localization and Explanation via Multi-Modal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in image tampering techniques, particularly generative models, pose significant challenges to media verification, digital forensics, and public trust. Existing image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) methods suffer from two key limitations: over-reliance on semantic content while neglecting textural cues, and limited interpretability of subtle low-level tampering traces. To address these issues, we propose FOCA, a multimodal large language model-based framework that integrates discriminative features from both the RGB spatial and frequency domains via a cross-attention fusion module. This design enables accurate forgery detection and localization while providing explicit, human-interpretable cross-domain explanations. We further introduce FSE-Set, a large-scale dataset with diverse authentic and tampered images, pixel-level masks, and dual-domain annotations. Extensive experiments show that FOCA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection performance and interpretability across both spatial and frequency domains.</description>

      <title>SceneTok: A Compressed, Diffusable Token Space for 3D Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SceneTok, a novel tokenizer for encoding view sets of scenes into a compressed and diffusable set of unstructured tokens. Existing approaches for 3D scene representation and generation commonly use 3D data structures or view-aligned fields. In contrast, we introduce the first method that encodes scene information into a small set of permutation-invariant tokens that is disentangled from the spatial grid. The scene tokens are predicted by a multi-view tokenizer given many context views and rendered into novel views by employing a light-weight rectified flow decoder. We show that the compression is 1-3 orders of magnitude stronger than for other representations while still reaching state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. Further, our representation can be rendered from novel trajectories, including ones deviating from the input trajectory, and we show that the decoder gracefully handles uncertainty. Finally, the highly-compressed set of unstructured latent scene tokens enables simple and efficient scene generation in 5 seconds, achieving a much better quality-speed trade-off than previous paradigms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing and simulating dynamic 3D scenes with both visual realism and physical consistency remains a fundamental challenge. Existing neural representations, such as NeRFs and 3DGS, excel in appearance reconstruction but struggle to capture complex material deformation and dynamics. We propose PhysConvex, a Physics-informed 3D Dynamic Convex Radiance Field that unifies visual rendering and physical simulation. PhysConvex represents deformable radiance fields using physically grounded convex primitives governed by continuum mechanics. We introduce a boundary-driven dynamic convex representation that models deformation through vertex and surface dynamics, capturing spatially adaptive, non-uniform deformation, and evolving boundaries. To efficiently simulate complex geometries and heterogeneous materials, we further develop a reduced-order convex simulation that advects dynamic convex fields using neural skinning eigenmodes as shape- and material-aware deformation bases with time-varying reduced DOFs under Newtonian dynamics. Convex dynamics also offers compact, gap-free volumetric coverage, enhancing both geometric efficiency and simulation fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that PhysConvex achieves high-fidelity reconstruction of geometry, appearance, and physical properties from videos, outperforming existing methods.</description>

      <title>SafeDrive: Fine-Grained Safety Reasoning for End-to-End Driving in a Sparse World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The end-to-end (E2E) paradigm, which maps sensor inputs directly to driving decisions, has recently attracted significant attention due to its unified modeling capability and scalability. However, ensuring safety in this unified framework remains one of the most critical challenges. In this work, we propose SafeDrive, an E2E planning framework designed to perform explicit and interpretable safety reasoning through a trajectory-conditioned Sparse World Model. SafeDrive comprises two complementary networks: the Sparse World Network (SWNet) and the Fine-grained Reasoning Network (FRNet). SWNet constructs trajectory-conditioned sparse worlds that simulate the future behaviors of critical dynamic agents and road entities, providing interaction-centric representations for downstream reasoning. FRNet then evaluates agent-specific collision risks and temporal adherence to drivable regions, enabling precise identification of safety-critical events across future timesteps. SafeDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance on both open-loop and closed-loop benchmarks. On NAVSIM, it records a PDMS of 91.6 and an EPDMS of 87.5, with only 61 collisions out of 12,146 scenarios (0.5%). On Bench2Drive, SafeDrive attains a 66.8% driving score.</description>

      <title>Beyond Stationarity: Rethinking Codebook Collapse in Vector Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) underpins many modern generative frameworks such as VQ-VAE, VQ-GAN, and latent diffusion models. Yet, it suffers from the persistent problem of codebook collapse, where a large fraction of code vectors remains unused during training. This work provides a new theoretical explanation by identifying the nonstationary nature of encoder updates as the fundamental cause of this phenomenon. We show that as the encoder drifts, unselected code vectors fail to receive updates and gradually become inactive. To address this, we propose two new methods: Non-Stationary Vector Quantization (NSVQ), which propagates encoder drift to non-selected codes through a kernel-based rule, and Transformer-based Vector Quantization (TransVQ), which employs a lightweight mapping to adaptively transform the entire codebook while preserving convergence to the k-means solution. Experiments on the CelebA-HQ dataset demonstrate that both methods achieve near-complete codebook utilization and superior reconstruction quality compared to baseline VQ variants, providing a principled and scalable foundation for future VQ-based generative models.

      <title>SCHEMA for Gemini 3 Pro Image: A Structured Methodology for Controlled AI Image Generation on Google's Native Multimodal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents SCHEMA (Structured Components for Harmonized Engineered Modular Architecture), a structured prompt engineering methodology specifically developed for Google Gemini 3 Pro Image. Unlike generic prompt guidelines or model-agnostic tips, SCHEMA is an engineered framework built on systematic professional practice encompassing 850 verified API predictions within an estimated corpus of approximately 4,800 generated images, spanning six professional domains: real estate photography, commercial product photography, editorial content, storyboards, commercial campaigns, and information design. The methodology introduces a three-tier progressive system (BASE, MEDIO, AVANZATO) that scales practitioner control from exploratory (approximately 5%) to directive (approximately 95%), a modular label architecture with 7 core and 5 optional structured components, a decision tree with explicit routing rules to alternative tools, and systematically documented model limitations with corresponding workarounds. Key findings include an observed 91% Mandatory compliance rate and 94% Prohibitions compliance rate across 621 structured prompts, a comparative batch consistency test demonstrating substantially higher inter-generation coherence for structured prompts, independent practitioner validation (n=40), and a dedicated Information Design validation demonstrating &gt;95% first-generation compliance for spatial and typographical control across approximately 300 publicly verifiable infographics.

      <title>Marginalized Bundle Adjustment: Multi-View Camera Pose from Monocular Depth Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) is a fundamental 3D vision task for recovering camera parameters and scene geometry from multi-view images. While recent deep learning advances enable accurate Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) from single images without depending on camera motion, integrating MDE into SfM remains a challenge. Unlike conventional triangulated sparse point clouds, MDE produces dense depth maps with significantly higher error variance. Inspired by modern RANSAC estimators, we propose Marginalized Bundle Adjustment (MBA) to mitigate MDE error variance leveraging its density. With MBA, we show that MDE depth maps are sufficiently accurate to yield SoTA or competitive results in SfM and camera relocalization tasks. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate consistently robust performance across varying scales, ranging from few-frame setups to large multi-view systems with thousands of images. Our method highlights the significant potential of MDE in multi-view 3D vision.</description>

      <title>CRAFT-LoRA: Content-Style Personalization via Rank-Constrained Adaptation and Training-Free Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized image generation requires effectively balancing content fidelity with stylistic consistency when synthesizing images based on text and reference examples. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers an efficient personalization approach, with potential for precise control through combining LoRA weights on different concepts. However, existing combination techniques face persistent challenges: entanglement between content and style representations, insufficient guidance for controlling elements' influence, and unstable weight fusion that often require additional training. We address these limitations through CRAFT-LoRA, with complementary components: (1) rank-constrained backbone fine-tuning that injects low-rank projection residuals to encourage learning decoupled content and style subspaces; (2) a prompt-guided approach featuring an expert encoder with specialized branches that enables semantic extension and precise control through selective adapter aggregation; and (3) a training-free, timestep-dependent classifier-free guidance scheme that enhances generation stability by strategically adjusting noise predictions across diffusion steps. Our method significantly improves content-style disentanglement, enables flexible semantic control over LoRA module combinations, and achieves high-fidelity generation without additional retraining overhead.</description>

      <title>Global Commander and Local Operative: A Dual-Agent Framework for Scene Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Scene navigation is a fundamental capability for embodied human-AI collaboration, requiring agents to follow natural language instructions to execute coherent action sequences in complex environments. Existing approaches either rely on multiple agents, incurring high coordination and resource costs, or adopt a single-agent paradigm, which overloads the agent with both global planning and local perception, often leading to degraded reasoning and instruction drift in long-horizon settings. To address these issues, we introduce DACo, a planning-grounding decoupled architecture that disentangles global deliberation from local grounding. Concretely, it employs a Global Commander for high-level strategic planning and a Local Operative for egocentric observing and fine-grained execution. By disentangling global reasoning from local action, DACo alleviates cognitive overload and improves long-horizon stability. The framework further integrates dynamic subgoal planning and adaptive replanning to enable structured and resilient navigation. Extensive evaluations on R2R, REVERIE, and R4R demonstrate that DACo achieves 4.9%, 6.5%, 5.4% absolute improvements over the best-performing baselines in zero-shot settings, and generalizes effectively across both closed-source (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source (e.g., Qwen-VL Series) backbones. DACo provides a principled and extensible paradigm for robust long-horizon navigation. Project page: https://github.com/ChocoWu/DACo</description>

      <title>YOLOv10-Based Multi-Task Framework for Hand Localization and Laterality Classification in Surgical Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time hand tracking in trauma surgery is essential for supporting rapid and precise intraoperative decisions. We propose a YOLOv10-based framework that simultaneously localizes hands and classifies their laterality (left or right) in complex surgical scenes. The model is trained on the Trauma THOMPSON Challenge 2025 Task 2 dataset, consisting of first-person surgical videos with annotated hand bounding boxes. Extensive data augmentation and a multi-task detection design improve robustness against motion blur, lighting variations, and diverse hand appearances. Evaluation demonstrates accurate left-hand (67\%) and right-hand (71\%) classification, while distinguishing hands from the background remains challenging. The model achieves an $mAP_{[0.5:0.95]}$ of 0.33 and maintains real-time inference, highlighting its potential for intraoperative deployment. This work establishes a foundation for advanced hand-instrument interaction analysis in emergency surgical procedures.</description>

      <title>Depth-Enhanced YOLO-SAM2 Detection for Reliable Ballast Insufficiency Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a depth-enhanced YOLO-SAM2 framework for detecting ballast insufficiency in railway tracks using RGB-D data. Although YOLOv8 provides reliable localization, the RGB-only model shows limited safety performance, achieving high precision (0.99) but low recall (0.49) due to insufficient ballast, as it tends to over-predict the sufficient class. To improve reliability, we incorporate depth-based geometric analysis enabled by a sleeper-aligned depth-correction pipeline that compensates for RealSense spatial distortion using polynomial modeling, RANSAC, and temporal smoothing. SAM2 segmentation further refines region-of-interest masks, enabling accurate extraction of sleeper and ballast profiles for geometric classification.
  Experiments on field-collected top-down RGB-D data show that depth-enhanced configurations substantially improve the detection of insufficient ballast. Depending on bounding-box sampling (AABB or RBB) and geometric criteria, recall increases from 0.49 to as high as 0.80, and F1-score improves from 0.66 to over 0.80. These results demonstrate that integrating depth correction with YOLO-SAM2 yields a more robust and reliable approach for automated railway ballast inspection, particularly in visually ambiguous or safety-critical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Face Presentation Attack Detection via Content-Adaptive Spatial Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face presentation attack detection (FacePAD) is critical for securing facial authentication against print, replay, and mask-based spoofing. This paper proposes CASO-PAD, an RGB-only, single-frame model that enhances MobileNetV3 with content-adaptive spatial operators (involution) to better capture localized spoof cues. Unlike spatially shared convolution kernels, the proposed operator generates location-specific, channel-shared kernels conditioned on the input, improving spatial selectivity with minimal overhead. CASO-PAD remains lightweight (3.6M parameters; 0.64 GFLOPs at $256\times256$) and is trained end-to-end using a standard binary cross-entropy objective. Extensive experiments on Replay-Attack, Replay-Mobile, ROSE-Youtu, and OULU-NPU demonstrate strong performance, achieving 100/100/98.9/99.7\% test accuracy, AUC of 1.00/1.00/0.9995/0.9999, and HTER of 0.00/0.00/0.82/0.44\%, respectively. On the large-scale SiW-Mv2 Protocol-1 benchmark, CASO-PAD further attains 95.45\% accuracy with 3.11\% HTER and 3.13\% EER, indicating improved robustness under diverse real-world attacks. Ablation studies show that placing the adaptive operator near the network head and using moderate group sharing yields the best accuracy--efficiency balance. Overall, CASO-PAD provides a practical pathway for robust, on-device FacePAD with mobile-class compute and without auxiliary sensors or temporal stacks.</description>

      <title>Frame2Freq: Spectral Adapters for Fine-Grained Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting image-pretrained backbones to video typically relies on time-domain adapters tuned to a single temporal scale. Our experiments show that these modules pick up static image cues and very fast flicker changes, while overlooking medium-speed motion. Capturing dynamics across multiple time-scales is, however, crucial for fine-grained temporal analysis (i.e., opening vs. closing bottle).
  To address this, we introduce Frame2Freq -- a family of frequency-aware adapters that perform spectral encoding during image-to-video adaptation of pretrained Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), improving fine-grained action recognition. Frame2Freq uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) along time and learns frequency-band specific embeddings that adaptively highlight the most discriminative frequency ranges. Across five fine-grained activity recognition datasets, Frame2Freq outperforms prior PEFT methods and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models on four of them. These results provide encouraging evidence that frequency analysis methods are a powerful tool for modeling temporal dynamics in image-to-video transfer. Code is available at https://github.com/th-nesh/Frame2Freq.</description>

      <title>IDSelect: A RL-Based Cost-Aware Selection Agent for Video-based Multi-Modal Person Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video-based person recognition achieves robust identification by integrating face, body, and gait. However, current systems waste computational resources by processing all modalities with fixed heavyweight ensembles regardless of input complexity. To address these limitations, we propose IDSelect, a reinforcement learning-based cost-aware selector that chooses one pre-trained model per modality per-sequence to optimize the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Our key insight is that an input-conditioned selector can discover complementary model choices that surpass fixed ensembles while using substantially fewer resources. IDSelect trains a lightweight agent end-to-end using actor-critic reinforcement learning with budget-aware optimization. The reward balances recognition accuracy with computational cost, while entropy regularization prevents premature convergence. At inference, the policy selects the most probable model per modality and fuses modality-specific similarities for the final score. Extensive experiments on challenging video-based datasets demonstrate IDSelect's superior efficiency: on CCVID, it achieves 95.9% Rank-1 accuracy with 92.4% less computation than strong baselines while improving accuracy by 1.8%; on MEVID, it reduces computation by 41.3% while maintaining competitive performance.</description>

      <title>SeaCache: Spectral-Evolution-Aware Cache for Accelerating Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are a strong backbone for visual generation, but their inherently sequential denoising process leads to slow inference. Previous methods accelerate sampling by caching and reusing intermediate outputs based on feature distances between adjacent timesteps. However, existing caching strategies typically rely on raw feature differences that entangle content and noise. This design overlooks spectral evolution, where low-frequency structure appears early and high-frequency detail is refined later. We introduce Spectral-Evolution-Aware Cache (SeaCache), a training-free cache schedule that bases reuse decisions on a spectrally aligned representation. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we derive a Spectral-Evolution-Aware (SEA) filter that preserves content-relevant components while suppressing noise. Employing SEA-filtered input features to estimate redundancy leads to dynamic schedules that adapt to content while respecting the spectral priors underlying the diffusion model. Extensive experiments on diverse visual generative models and the baselines show that SeaCache achieves state-of-the-art latency-quality trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Learning Cross-View Object Correspondence via Cycle-Consistent Mask Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the task of establishing object-level visual correspondence across different viewpoints in videos, focusing on the challenging egocentric-to-exocentric and exocentric-to-egocentric scenarios. We propose a simple yet effective framework based on conditional binary segmentation, where an object query mask is encoded into a latent representation to guide the localization of the corresponding object in a target video. To encourage robust, view-invariant representations, we introduce a cycle-consistency training objective: the predicted mask in the target view is projected back to the source view to reconstruct the original query mask. This bidirectional constraint provides a strong self-supervisory signal without requiring ground-truth annotations and enables test-time training (TTT) at inference. Experiments on the Ego-Exo4D and HANDAL-X benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimization objective and TTT strategy, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

      <title>A Benchmark and Knowledge-Grounded Framework for Advanced Multimodal Personalization Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The powerful reasoning of modern Vision Language Models open a new frontier for advanced personalization study. However, progress in this area is critically hampered by the lack of suitable benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce Life-Bench, a comprehensive, synthetically generated multimodal benchmark built on simulated user digital footprints. Life-Bench features over questions evaluating a wide spectrum of capabilities, from persona understanding to complex reasoning over historical data. These capabilities expand far beyond prior benchmarks, reflecting the critical demands essential for real-world applications. Furthermore, we propose LifeGraph, an end-to-end framework that organizes personal context into a knowledge graph to facilitate structured retrieval and reasoning. Our experiments on Life-Bench reveal that existing methods falter significantly on complex personalized tasks, exposing a large performance headroom, especially in relational, temporal and aggregative reasoning. While LifeGraph closes this gap by leveraging structured knowledge and demonstrates a promising direction, these advanced personalization tasks remain a critical open challenge, motivating new research in this area.</description>

      <title>MoBind: Motion Binding for Fine-Grained IMU-Video Pose Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to learn a joint representation between inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals and 2D pose sequences extracted from video, enabling accurate cross-modal retrieval, temporal synchronization, subject and body-part localization, and action recognition. To this end, we introduce MoBind, a hierarchical contrastive learning framework designed to address three challenges: (1) filtering out irrelevant visual background, (2) modeling structured multi-sensor IMU configurations, and (3) achieving fine-grained, sub-second temporal alignment. To isolate motion-relevant cues, MoBind aligns IMU signals with skeletal motion sequences rather than raw pixels. We further decompose full-body motion into local body-part trajectories, pairing each with its corresponding IMU to enable semantically grounded multi-sensor alignment. To capture detailed temporal correspondence, MoBind employs a hierarchical contrastive strategy that first aligns token-level temporal segments, then fuses local (body-part) alignment with global (body-wide) motion aggregation. Evaluated on mRi, TotalCapture, and EgoHumans, MoBind consistently outperforms strong baselines across all four tasks, demonstrating robust fine-grained temporal alignment while preserving coarse semantic consistency across modalities. Code is available at https://github.com/bbvisual/ MoBind.</description>

      <title>GUIDE-US: Grade-Informed Unpaired Distillation of Encoder Knowledge from Histopathology to Micro-UltraSound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Non-invasive grading of prostate cancer (PCa) from micro-ultrasound (micro-US) could expedite triage and guide biopsies toward the most aggressive regions, yet current models struggle to infer tissue micro-structure at coarse imaging resolutions.
  Methods: We introduce an unpaired histopathology knowledge-distillation strategy that trains a micro-US encoder to emulate the embedding distribution of a pretrained histopathology foundation model, conditioned on International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grades. Training requires no patient-level pairing or image registration, and histopathology inputs are not used at inference.
  Results: Compared to the current state of the art, our approach increases sensitivity to clinically significant PCa (csPCa) at 60% specificity by 3.5% and improves overall sensitivity at 60% specificity by 1.2%.
  Conclusion: By enabling earlier and more dependable cancer risk stratification solely from imaging, our method advances clinical feasibility. Source code will be publicly released upon publication.</description>

      <title>TokenTrace: Multi-Concept Attribution through Watermarked Token Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI models pose a significant challenge to intellectual property (IP), as they can replicate unique artistic styles and concepts without attribution. While watermarking offers a potential solution, existing methods often fail in complex scenarios where multiple concepts (e.g., an object and an artistic style) are composed within a single image. These methods struggle to disentangle and attribute each concept individually. In this work, we introduce TokenTrace, a novel proactive watermarking framework for robust, multi-concept attribution. Our method embeds secret signatures into the semantic domain by simultaneously perturbing the text prompt embedding and the initial latent noise that guide the diffusion model's generation process. For retrieval, we propose a query-based TokenTrace module that takes the generated image and a textual query specifying which concepts need to be retrieved (e.g., a specific object or style) as inputs. This query-based mechanism allows the module to disentangle and independently verify the presence of multiple concepts from a single generated image. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-concept (object and style) and multi-concept attribution tasks, significantly outperforming existing baselines while maintaining high visual quality and robustness to common transformations.</description>

      <title>An interpretable framework using foundation models for fish sex identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate sex identification in fish is vital for optimizing breeding and management strategies in aquaculture, particularly for species at the risk of extinction. However, most existing methods are invasive or stressful and may cause additional mortality, posing severe risks to threatened or endangered fish populations. To address these challenges, we propose FishProtoNet, a robust, non-invasive computer vision-based framework for sex identification of delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), an endangered fish species native to California, across its full life cycle. Unlike the traditional deep learning methods, FishProtoNet provides interpretability through learned prototype representations while improving robustness by leveraging foundation models to reduce the influence of background noise. Specifically, the FishProtoNet framework consists of three key components: fish regions of interest (ROIs) extraction using visual foundation model, feature extraction from fish ROIs and fish sex identification based on an interpretable prototype network. FishProtoNet demonstrates strong performance in delta smelt sex identification during early spawning and post-spawning stages, achieving the accuracies of 74.40% and 81.16% and corresponding F1 scores of 74.27% and 79.43% respectively. In contrast, delta smelt sex identification at the subadult stage remains challenging for current computer vision methods, likely due to less pronounced morphological differences in immature fish. The source code of FishProtoNet is publicly available at: https://github.com/zhengmiao1/Fish_sex_identification</description>

      <title>Towards Calibrating Prompt Tuning of Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt tuning of large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP enables efficient task adaptation without updating model weights. However, it often leads to poor confidence calibration and unreliable predictive uncertainty. We address this problem by proposing a calibration framework that enhances predictive reliability while preserving the geometry of the pretrained CLIP embedding space, which is required for robust generalization. Our approach extends the standard cross-entropy loss with two complementary regularizers: (1) a mean-variance margin penalty that stabilizes inter-class logit margins by maximizing their average while minimizing dispersion, mitigating underconfidence and overconfidence spikes; and (2) a text moment-matching loss that aligns the first and second moments of tuned text embeddings with their frozen CLIP counterparts, preserving semantic dispersion crucial for generalization. Through extensive experiments across 7 prompt-tuning methods and 11 diverse datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) compared to competitive calibration techniques on both base and novel classes</description>

      <title>OpenVO: Open-World Visual Odometry with Temporal Dynamics Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce OpenVO, a novel framework for Open-world Visual Odometry (VO) with temporal awareness under limited input conditions. OpenVO effectively estimates real-world-scale ego-motion from monocular dashcam footage with varying observation rates and uncalibrated cameras, enabling robust trajectory dataset construction from rare driving events recorded in dashcam. Existing VO methods are trained on fixed observation frequency (e.g., 10Hz or 12Hz), completely overlooking temporal dynamics information. Many prior methods also require calibrated cameras with known intrinsic parameters. Consequently, their performance degrades when (1) deployed under unseen observation frequencies or (2) applied to uncalibrated cameras. These significantly limit their generalizability to many downstream tasks, such as extracting trajectories from dashcam footage. To address these challenges, OpenVO (1) explicitly encodes temporal dynamics information within a two-frame pose regression framework and (2) leverages 3D geometric priors derived from foundation models. We validate our method on three major autonomous-driving benchmarks - KITTI, nuScenes, and Argoverse 2 - achieving more than 20 performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches. Under varying observation rate settings, our method is significantly more robust, achieving 46%-92% lower errors across all metrics. These results demonstrate the versatility of OpenVO for real-world 3D reconstruction and diverse downstream applications.</description>

      <title>TeFlow: Enabling Multi-frame Supervision for Self-Supervised Feed-forward Scene Flow Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised feed-forward methods for scene flow estimation offer real-time efficiency, but their supervision from two-frame point correspondences is unreliable and often breaks down under occlusions. Multi-frame supervision has the potential to provide more stable guidance by incorporating motion cues from past frames, yet naive extensions of two-frame objectives are ineffective because point correspondences vary abruptly across frames, producing inconsistent signals. In the paper, we present TeFlow, enabling multi-frame supervision for feed-forward models by mining temporally consistent supervision. TeFlow introduces a temporal ensembling strategy that forms reliable supervisory signals by aggregating the most temporally consistent motion cues from a candidate pool built across multiple frames. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TeFlow establishes a new state-of-the-art for self-supervised feed-forward methods, achieving performance gains of up to 33\% on the challenging Argoverse 2 and nuScenes datasets. Our method performs on par with leading optimization-based methods, yet speeds up 150 times. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/KTH-RPL/OpenSceneFlow along with trained model weights.</description>

      <title>Direction-aware 3D Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D large multimodal models (3D LMMs) rely heavily on ego poses for enabling directional question-answering and spatial reasoning. However, most existing point cloud benchmarks contain rich directional queries but lack the corresponding ego poses, making them inherently ill-posed in 3D large multimodal modelling. In this work, we redefine a new and rigorous paradigm that enables direction-aware 3D LMMs by identifying and supplementing ego poses into point cloud benchmarks and transforming the corresponding point cloud data according to the identified ego poses. We enable direction-aware 3D LMMs with two novel designs. The first is PoseRecover, a fully automatic pose recovery pipeline that matches questions with ego poses from RGB-D video extrinsics via object-frustum intersection and visibility check with Z-buffers. The second is PoseAlign that transforms the point cloud data to be aligned with the identified ego poses instead of either injecting ego poses into textual prompts or introducing pose-encoded features in the projection layers. Extensive experiments show that our designs yield consistent improvements across multiple 3D LMM backbones such as LL3DA, LL3DA-SONATA, Chat-Scene, and 3D-LLAVA, improving ScanRefer mIoU by 30.0% and Scan2Cap LLM-as-judge accuracy by 11.7%. In addition, our approach is simple, generic, and training-efficient, requiring only instruction tuning while establishing a strong baseline for direction-aware 3D-LMMs.</description>

      <title>L3DR: 3D-aware LiDAR Diffusion and Rectification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Range-view (RV) based LiDAR diffusion has recently made huge strides towards 2D photo-realism. However, it neglects 3D geometry realism and often generates various RV artifacts such as depth bleeding and wavy surfaces. We design L3DR, a 3D-aware LiDAR Diffusion and Rectification framework that can regress and cancel RV artifacts in 3D space and restore local geometry accurately. Our theoretical and empirical analysis reveals that 3D models are inherently superior to 2D models in generating sharp and authentic boundaries. Leveraging such analysis, we design a 3D residual regression network that rectifies RV artifacts and achieves superb geometry realism by predicting point-level offsets in 3D space. On top of that, we design a Welsch Loss that helps focus on local geometry and ignore anomalous regions effectively. Extensive experiments over multiple benchmarks including KITTI, KITTI360, nuScenes and Waymo show that the proposed L3DR achieves state-of-the-art generation and superior geometry-realism consistently. In addition, L3DR is generally applicable to different LiDAR diffusion models with little computational overhead.</description>

      <title>ChordEdit: One-Step Low-Energy Transport for Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of one-step text-to-image (T2I) models offers unprecedented synthesis speed. However, their application to text-guided image editing remains severely hampered, as forcing existing training-free editors into a single inference step fails. This failure manifests as severe object distortion and a critical loss of consistency in non-edited regions, resulting from the high-energy, erratic trajectories produced by naive vector arithmetic on the models' structured fields. To address this problem, we introduce ChordEdit, a model agnostic, training-free, and inversion-free method that facilitates high-fidelity one-step editing. We recast editing as a transport problem between the source and target distributions defined by the source and target text prompts. Leveraging dynamic optimal transport theory, we derive a principled, low-energy control strategy. This strategy yields a smoothed, variance-reduced editing field that is inherently stable, facilitating the field to be traversed in a single, large integration step. A theoretically grounded and experimentally validated approach allows ChordEdit to deliver fast, lightweight and precise edits, finally achieving true real-time editing on these challenging models.</description>

      <title>Restoration-Guided Kuzushiji Character Recognition Framework under Seal Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kuzushiji was one of the most popular writing styles in pre-modern Japan and was widely used in both personal letters and official documents. However, due to its highly cursive forms and extensive glyph variations, most modern Japanese readers cannot directly interpret Kuzushiji characters. Therefore, recent research has focused on developing automated Kuzushiji character recognition methods, which have achieved satisfactory performance on relatively clean Kuzushiji document images. However, existing methods struggle to maintain recognition accuracy under seal interference (e.g., when seals overlap characters), despite the frequent occurrence of seals in pre-modern Japanese documents. To address this challenge, we propose a three-stage restoration-guided Kuzushiji character recognition (RG-KCR) framework specifically designed to mitigate seal interference. We construct datasets for evaluating Kuzushiji character detection (Stage 1) and classification (Stage 3). Experimental results show that the YOLOv12-medium model achieves a precision of 98.0% and a recall of 93.3% on the constructed test set. We quantitatively evaluate the restoration performance of Stage 2 using PSNR and SSIM. In addition, we conduct an ablation study to demonstrate that Stage 2 improves the Top-1 accuracy of Metom, a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based Kuzushiji classifier employed in Stage 3, from 93.45% to 95.33%. The implementation code of this work is available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/RG-KCR.</description>

      <title>Ani3DHuman: Photorealistic 3D Human Animation with Self-guided Stochastic Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current 3D human animation methods struggle to achieve photorealism: kinematics-based approaches lack non-rigid dynamics (e.g., clothing dynamics), while methods that leverage video diffusion priors can synthesize non-rigid motion but suffer from quality artifacts and identity loss. To overcome these limitations, we present Ani3DHuman, a framework that marries kinematics-based animation with video diffusion priors. We first introduce a layered motion representation that disentangles rigid motion from residual non-rigid motion. Rigid motion is generated by a kinematic method, which then produces a coarse rendering to guide the video diffusion model in generating video sequences that restore the residual non-rigid motion. However, this restoration task, based on diffusion sampling, is highly challenging, as the initial renderings are out-of-distribution, causing standard deterministic ODE samplers to fail. Therefore, we propose a novel self-guided stochastic sampling method, which effectively addresses the out-of-distribution problem by combining stochastic sampling (for photorealistic quality) with self-guidance (for identity fidelity). These restored videos provide high-quality supervision, enabling the optimization of the residual non-rigid motion field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \MethodName can generate photorealistic 3D human animation, outperforming existing methods.

      <title>CREM: Compression-Driven Representation Enhancement for Multimodal Retrieval and Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable success in comprehension tasks such as visual description and visual question answering. However, their direct application to embedding-based tasks like retrieval remains challenging due to the discrepancy between output formats and optimization objectives. Previous approaches often employ contrastive fine-tuning to adapt MLLMs for retrieval, but at the cost of losing their generative capabilities. We argue that both generative and embedding tasks fundamentally rely on shared cognitive mechanisms, specifically cross-modal representation alignment and contextual comprehension. To this end, we propose CREM (Compression-driven Representation Enhanced Model), with a unified framework that enhances multimodal representations for retrieval while preserving generative ability. Specifically, we introduce a compression-based prompt design with learnable chorus tokens to aggregate multimodal semantics and a compression-driven training strategy that integrates contrastive and generative objectives through compression-aware attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CREM achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance on MMEB while maintaining strong generative performance on multiple comprehension benchmarks. Our findings highlight that generative supervision can further improve the representational quality of MLLMs under the proposed compression-driven paradigm.</description>

      <title>Universal 3D Shape Matching via Coarse-to-Fine Language Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences between shapes is a crucial task in computer vision and graphics, while prior approaches depend on near-isometric assumptions and homogeneous subject types (i.e., only operate for human shapes). However, building semantic correspondences for cross-category objects remains challenging and has received relatively little attention. To achieve this, we propose UniMatch, a semantic-aware, coarse-to-fine framework for constructing dense semantic correspondences between strongly non-isometric shapes without restricting object categories. The key insight is to lift "coarse" semantic cues into "fine" correspondence, which is achieved through two stages. In the "coarse" stage, we perform class-agnostic 3D segmentation to obtain non-overlapping semantic parts and prompt multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to identify part names. Then, we employ pretrained vision language models (VLMs) to extract text embeddings, enabling the construction of matched semantic parts. In the "fine" stage, we leverage these coarse correspondences to guide the learning of dense correspondences through a dedicated rank-based contrastive scheme. Thanks to class-agnostic segmentation, language guiding, and rank-based contrastive learning, our method is versatile for universal object categories and requires no predefined part proposals, enabling universal matching for inter-class and non-isometric shapes. Extensive experiments demonstrate UniMatch consistently outperforms competing methods in various challenging scenarios.</description>

      <title>Keep it SymPL: Symbolic Projective Layout for Allocentric Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perspective-aware spatial reasoning involves understanding spatial relationships from specific viewpoints-either egocentric (observer-centered) or allocentric (object-centered). While vision-language models (VLMs) perform well in egocentric settings, their performance deteriorates when reasoning from allocentric viewpoints, where spatial relations must be inferred from the perspective of objects within the scene. In this study, we address this underexplored challenge by introducing Symbolic Projective Layout (SymPL), a framework that reformulates allocentric reasoning into symbolic-layout forms that VLMs inherently handle well. By leveraging four key factors-projection, abstraction, bipartition, and localization-SymPL converts allocentric questions into structured symbolic-layout representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this reformulation substantially improves performance in both allocentric and egocentric tasks, enhances robustness under visual illusions and multi-view scenarios, and that each component contributes critically to these gains. These results show that SymPL provides an effective and principled approach for addressing complex perspective-aware spatial reasoning.</description>

      <title>StreetTree: A Large-Scale Global Benchmark for Fine-Grained Tree Species Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fine-grained classification of street trees is a crucial task for urban planning, streetscape management, and the assessment of urban ecosystem services. However, progress in this field has been significantly hindered by the lack of large-scale, geographically diverse, and publicly available benchmark datasets specifically designed for street trees. To address this critical gap, we introduce StreetTree, the world's first large-scale benchmark dataset dedicated to fine-grained street tree classification. The dataset contains over 12 million images covering more than 8,300 common street tree species, collected from urban streetscapes across 133 countries spanning five continents, and supplemented with expert-verified observational data. StreetTree poses substantial challenges for pretrained vision models under complex urban environments: high inter-species visual similarity, long-tailed natural distributions, significant intra-class variations caused by seasonal changes, and diverse imaging conditions such as lighting, occlusions from buildings, and varying camera angles. In addition, we provide a hierarchical taxonomy (order-family-genus-species) to support research in hierarchical classification and representation learning. Through extensive experiments with various visual models, we establish strong baselines and reveal the limitations of existing methods in handling such real-world complexities. We believe that StreetTree will serve as a key resource for the refined management and research of urban street trees, while also driving new advancements at the intersection of computer vision and urban science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating parameter counts in modern deep learning models pose a fundamental challenge to efficient training and resolution of overfitting. We address this by introducing the \emph{Mapping Networks} which replace the high dimensional weight space by a compact, trainable latent vector based on the hypothesis that the trained parameters of large networks reside on smooth, low-dimensional manifolds. Henceforth, the Mapping Theorem enforced by a dedicated Mapping Loss, shows the existence of a mapping from this latent space to the target weight space both theoretically and in practice. Mapping Networks significantly reduce overfitting and achieve comparable to better performance than target network across complex vision and sequence tasks, including Image Classification, Deepfake Detection etc, with $\mathbf{99.5\%}$, i.e., around $500\times$ reduction in trainable parameters.</description>

      <title>CaReFlow: Cyclic Adaptive Rectified Flow for Multimodal Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modality gap significantly restricts the effectiveness of multimodal fusion. Previous methods often use techniques such as diffusion models and adversarial learning to reduce the modality gap, but they typically focus on one-to-one alignment without exposing the data points of the source modality to the global distribution information of the target modality. To this end, leveraging the characteristic of rectified flow that can map one distribution to another via a straight trajectory, we extend rectified flow for modality distribution mapping. Specifically, we leverage the `one-to-many mapping' strategy in rectified flow that allows each data point of the source modality to observe the overall target distribution. This also alleviates the issue of insufficient paired data within each sample, enabling a more robust distribution transformation. Moreover, to achieve more accurate distribution mapping and address the ambiguous flow directions in one-to-many mapping, we design `adaptive relaxed alignment', enforcing stricter alignment for modality pairs belonging to the same sample, while applying relaxed mapping for pairs not belonging to the same sample or category. Additionally, to prevent information loss during distribution mapping, we introduce `cyclic rectified flow' to ensure the transferred features can be translated back to the original features, allowing multimodal representations to learn sufficient modality-specific information. After distribution alignment, our approach achieves very competitive results on multiple tasks of multimodal affective computing even with a simple fusion method, and visualizations verify that it can effectively reduce the modality gap.</description>

      <title>VIGiA: Instructional Video Guidance via Dialogue Reasoning and Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce VIGiA, a novel multimodal dialogue model designed to understand and reason over complex, multi-step instructional video action plans. Unlike prior work which focuses mainly on text-only guidance, or treats vision and language in isolation, VIGiA supports grounded, plan-aware dialogue that requires reasoning over visual inputs, instructional plans, and interleaved user interactions. To this end, VIGiA incorporates two key capabilities: (1) multimodal plan reasoning, enabling the model to align uni- and multimodal queries with the current task plan and respond accurately; and (2) plan-based retrieval, allowing it to retrieve relevant plan steps in either textual or visual representations. Experiments were done on a novel dataset with rich Instructional Video Dialogues aligned with Cooking and DIY plans. Our evaluation shows that VIGiA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on all tasks in a conversational plan guidance setting, reaching over 90\% accuracy on plan-aware VQA.</description>

      <title>Artefact-Aware Fungal Detection in Dermatophytosis: A Real-Time Transformer-Based Approach for KOH Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dermatophytosis is commonly assessed using potassium hydroxide (KOH) microscopy, yet accurate recognition of fungal hyphae is hindered by artefacts, heterogeneous keratin clearance, and notable inter-observer variability. This study presents a transformer-based detection framework using the RT-DETR model architecture to achieve precise, query-driven localization of fungal structures in high-resolution KOH images. A dataset of 2,540 routinely acquired microscopy images was manually annotated using a multi-class strategy to explicitly distinguish fungal elements from confounding artefacts. The model was trained with morphology-preserving augmentations to maintain the structural integrity of thin hyphae. Evaluation on an independent test set demonstrated robust object-level performance, with a recall of 0.9737, precision of 0.8043, and an AP@0.50 of 93.56%. When aggregated for image-level diagnosis, the model achieved 100% sensitivity and 98.8% accuracy, correctly identifying all positive cases without missing a single diagnosis. Qualitative outputs confirmed the robust localization of low-contrast hyphae even in artefact-rich fields. These results highlight that an artificial intelligence (AI) system can serve as a highly reliable, automated screening tool, effectively bridging the gap between image-level analysis and clinical decision-making in dermatomycology.</description>

      <title>Flash-VAED: Plug-and-Play VAE Decoders for Efficient Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet their inference remains costly and time-consuming. As diffusion transformers become increasingly efficient, the latency bottleneck inevitably shifts to VAE decoders. To reduce their latency while maintaining quality, we propose a universal acceleration framework for VAE decoders that preserves full alignment with the original latent distribution. Specifically, we propose (1) an independence-aware channel pruning method to effectively mitigate severe channel redundancy, and (2) a stage-wise dominant operator optimization strategy to address the high inference cost of the widely used causal 3D convolutions in VAE decoders. Based on these innovations, we construct a Flash-VAED family. Moreover, we design a three-phase dynamic distillation framework that efficiently transfers the capabilities of the original VAE decoder to Flash-VAED. Extensive experiments on Wan and LTX-Video VAE decoders demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines in both quality and speed, achieving approximately a 6$\times$ speedup while maintaining the reconstruction performance up to 96.9%. Notably, Flash-VAED accelerates the end-to-end generation pipeline by up to 36% with negligible quality drops on VBench-2.0.</description>

      <title>JavisDiT++: Unified Modeling and Optimization for Joint Audio-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AIGC has rapidly expanded from text-to-image generation toward high-quality multimodal synthesis across video and audio. Within this context, joint audio-video generation (JAVG) has emerged as a fundamental task that produces synchronized and semantically aligned sound and vision from textual descriptions. However, compared with advanced commercial models such as Veo3, existing open-source methods still suffer from limitations in generation quality, temporal synchrony, and alignment with human preferences. To bridge the gap, this paper presents JavisDiT++, a concise yet powerful framework for unified modeling and optimization of JAVG. First, we introduce a modality-specific mixture-of-experts (MS-MoE) design that enables cross-modal interaction efficacy while enhancing single-modal generation quality. Then, we propose a temporal-aligned RoPE (TA-RoPE) strategy to achieve explicit, frame-level synchronization between audio and video tokens. Besides, we develop an audio-video direct preference optimization (AV-DPO) method to align model outputs with human preference across quality, consistency, and synchrony dimensions. Built upon Wan2.1-1.3B-T2V, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance merely with around 1M public training entries, significantly outperforming prior approaches in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Comprehensive ablation studies have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed modules. All the code, model, and dataset are released at https://JavisVerse.github.io/JavisDiT2-page.</description>

      <title>BriMA: Bridged Modality Adaptation for Multi-Modal Continual Action Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) aims to score how well an action is performed and is widely used in sports analysis, rehabilitation assessment, and human skill evaluation. Multi-modal AQA has recently achieved strong progress by leveraging complementary visual and kinematic cues, yet real-world deployments often suffer from non-stationary modality imbalance, where certain modalities become missing or intermittently available due to sensor failures or annotation gaps. Existing continual AQA methods overlook this issue and assume that all modalities remain complete and stable throughout training, which restricts their practicality. To address this challenge, we introduce Bridged Modality Adaptation (BriMA), an innovative approach to multi-modal continual AQA under modality-missing conditions. BriMA consists of a memory-guided bridging imputation module that reconstructs missing modalities using both task-agnostic and task-specific representations, and a modality-aware replay mechanism that prioritizes informative samples based on modality distortion and distribution drift. Experiments on three representative multi-modal AQA datasets (RG, Fis-V, and FS1000) show that BriMA consistently improves performance under different modality-missing conditions, achieving 6--8\% higher correlation and 12--15\% lower error on average. These results demonstrate a step toward robust multi-modal AQA systems under real-world deployment constraints.</description>

      <title>EMAD: Evidence-Centric Grounded Multimodal Diagnosis for Alzheimer's Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image analysis often act as black boxes, seldom aligning with clinical guidelines or explicitly linking decisions to supporting evidence. This is especially critical in Alzheimer's disease (AD), where predictions should be grounded in both anatomical and clinical findings. We present EMAD, a vision-language framework that generates structured AD diagnostic reports in which each claim is explicitly grounded in multimodal evidence. EMAD uses a hierarchical Sentence-Evidence-Anatomy (SEA) grounding mechanism: (i) sentence-to-evidence grounding links generated sentences to clinical evidence phrases, and (ii) evidence-to-anatomy grounding localizes corresponding structures on 3D brain MRI. To reduce dense annotation requirements, we propose GTX-Distill, which transfers grounding behavior from a teacher trained with limited supervision to a student operating on model-generated reports. We further introduce Executable-Rule GRPO, a reinforcement fine-tuning scheme with verifiable rewards that enforces clinical consistency, protocol adherence, and reasoning-diagnosis coherence. On the AD-MultiSense dataset, EMAD achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and produces more transparent, anatomically faithful reports than existing methods. We will release code and grounding annotations to support future research in trustworthy medical vision-language models.</description>

      <title>VLM-Guided Group Preference Alignment for Diffusion-based Human Mesh Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human mesh recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image is inherently ambiguous, as multiple 3D poses can correspond to the same 2D observation. Recent diffusion-based methods tackle this by generating various hypotheses, but often sacrifice accuracy. They yield predictions that are either physically implausible or drift from the input image, especially under occlusion or in cluttered, in-the-wild scenes. To address this, we introduce a dual-memory augmented HMR critique agent with self-reflection to produce context-aware quality scores for predicted meshes. These scores distill fine-grained cues about 3D human motion structure, physical feasibility, and alignment with the input image. We use these scores to build a group-wise HMR preference dataset. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a group preference alignment framework for finetuning diffusion-based HMR models. This process injects the rich preference signals into the model, guiding it to generate more physically plausible and image-consistent human meshes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>PositionOCR: Augmenting Positional Awareness in Multi-Modal Models via Hybrid Specialist Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance in OCR-centric Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, illustrating their capability to process heterogeneous data and exhibit adaptability across varied contexts. However, these MLLMs rely on a Large Language Model (LLM) as the decoder, which is primarily designed for linguistic processing, and thus inherently lacks the positional reasoning required for precise visual tasks, such as text spotting and text grounding. Additionally, the extensive parameters of MLLMs necessitate substantial computational resources and large-scale data for effective training. Conversely, text spotting specialists achieve state-of-the-art coordinate predictions but lack semantic reasoning capabilities. This dichotomy motivates our key research question: Can we synergize the efficiency of specialists with the contextual power of LLMs to create a positionally-accurate MLLM? To overcome these challenges, we introduce PositionOCR, a parameter-efficient hybrid architecture that seamlessly integrates a text spotting model's positional strengths with an LLM's contextual reasoning. Comprising 131M trainable parameters, this framework demonstrates outstanding multi-modal processing capabilities, particularly excelling in tasks such as text grounding and text spotting, consistently surpassing traditional MLLMs.</description>

      <title>FUSAR-GPT : A Spatiotemporal Feature-Embedded and Two-Stage Decoupled Visual Language Model for SAR Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on the intelligent interpretation of all-weather, all-time Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is crucial for advancing remote sensing applications. In recent years, although Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong open-world understanding capabilities on RGB images, their performance is severely limited when directly applied to the SAR field due to the complexity of the imaging mechanism, sensitivity to scattering features, and the scarcity of high-quality text corpora. To systematically address this issue, we constructed the inaugural SAR Image-Text-AlphaEarth feature triplet dataset and developed FUSAR-GPT, a VLM specifically for SAR. FUSAR-GPT innovatively introduces a geospatial baseline model as a 'world knowledge' prior and embeds multi-source remote-sensing temporal features into the model's visual backbone via 'spatiotemporal anchors', enabling dynamic compensation for the sparse representation of targets in SAR images. Furthermore, we designed a two-stage SFT strategy to decouple the knowledge injection and task execution of large models. The spatiotemporal feature embedding and the two-stage decoupling paradigm enable FUSAR-GPT to achieve state-of-the-art performance across several typical remote sensing visual-language benchmark tests, significantly outperforming mainstream baseline models by over 12%.</description>

      <title>Prompt Tuning for CLIP on the Pretrained Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt tuning introduces learnable prompt vectors that adapt pretrained vision-language models to downstream tasks in a parameter-efficient manner. However, under limited supervision, prompt tuning alters pretrained representations and drives downstream features away from the pretrained manifold toward directions that are unfavorable for transfer. This drift degrades generalization. To address this limitation, we propose ManiPT, a framework that performs prompt tuning on the pretrained manifold. ManiPT introduces cosine consistency constraints in both the text and image modalities to confine the learned representations within the pretrained geometric neighborhood. Furthermore, we introduce a structural bias that enforces incremental corrections, guiding the adaptation along transferable directions to mitigate reliance on shortcut learning. From a theoretical perspective, ManiPT alleviates overfitting tendencies under limited data. Our experiments cover four downstream settings: unseen-class generalization, few-shot classification, cross-dataset transfer, and domain generalization. Across these settings, ManiPT achieves higher average performance than baseline methods. Notably, ManiPT provides an explicit perspective on how prompt tuning overfits under limited supervision.</description>

      <title>UniE2F: A Unified Diffusion Framework for Event-to-Frame Reconstruction with Video Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras excel at high-speed, low-power, and high-dynamic-range scene perception. However, as they fundamentally record only relative intensity changes rather than absolute intensity, the resulting data streams suffer from a significant loss of spatial information and static texture details. In this paper, we address this limitation by leveraging the generative prior of a pre-trained video diffusion model to reconstruct high-fidelity video frames from sparse event data. Specifically, we first establish a baseline model by directly applying event data as a condition to synthesize videos. Then, based on the physical correlation between the event stream and video frames, we further introduce the event-based inter-frame residual guidance to enhance the accuracy of video frame reconstruction. Furthermore, we extend our method to video frame interpolation and prediction in a zero-shot manner by modulating the reverse diffusion sampling process, thereby creating a unified event-to-frame reconstruction framework. Experimental results on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively. We also refer the reviewers to the video demo contained in the supplementary material for video results. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/CS-GangXu/UniE2F.</description>

      <title>GS-CLIP: Zero-shot 3D Anomaly Detection by Geometry-Aware Prompt and Synergistic View Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot 3D Anomaly Detection is an emerging task that aims to detect anomalies in a target dataset without any target training data, which is particularly important in scenarios constrained by sample scarcity and data privacy concerns. While current methods adapt CLIP by projecting 3D point clouds into 2D representations, they face challenges. The projection inherently loses some geometric details, and the reliance on a single 2D modality provides an incomplete visual understanding, limiting their ability to detect diverse anomaly types. To address these limitations, we propose the Geometry-Aware Prompt and Synergistic View Representation Learning (GS-CLIP) framework, which enables the model to identify geometric anomalies through a two-stage learning process. In stage 1, we dynamically generate text prompts embedded with 3D geometric priors. These prompts contain global shape context and local defect information distilled by our Geometric Defect Distillation Module (GDDM). In stage 2, we introduce Synergistic View Representation Learning architecture that processes rendered and depth images in parallel. A Synergistic Refinement Module (SRM) subsequently fuses the features of both streams, capitalizing on their complementary strengths. Comprehensive experimental results on four large-scale public datasets show that GS-CLIP achieves superior performance in detection.

      <title>SegMoTE: Token-Level Mixture of Experts for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis and quantitative analysis, yet remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of imaging modalities and the high cost of pixel-level annotations. Although general interactive segmentation models like SAM have achieved remarkable progress, their transfer to medical imaging still faces two key bottlenecks: (i) the lack of adaptive mechanisms for modality- and anatomy-specific tasks, which limits generalization in out-of-distribution medical scenarios; and (ii) current medical adaptation methods fine-tune on large, heterogeneous datasets without selection, leading to noisy supervision, higher cost, and negative transfer. To address these issues, we propose SegMoTE, an efficient and adaptive framework for medical image segmentation. SegMoTE preserves SAM's original prompt interface, efficient inference, and zero-shot generalization while introducing only a small number of learnable parameters to dynamically adapt across modalities and tasks. In addition, we design a progressive prompt tokenization mechanism that enables fully automatic segmentation, significantly reducing annotation dependence. Trained on MedSeg-HQ, a curated dataset less than 1% of existing large-scale datasets, SegMoTE achieves SOTA performance across diverse imaging modalities and anatomical tasks. It represents the first efficient, robust, and scalable adaptation of general segmentation models to the medical domain under extremely low annotation cost, advancing the practical deployment of foundation vision models in clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Questions beyond Pixels: Integrating Commonsense Knowledge in Visual Question Generation for Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of remote sensing image archives, asking questions about images has become an effective way of gathering specific information or performing semantic image retrieval. However, current automatically generated questions tend to be simplistic and template-based, which hinders the deployment of question answering or visual dialogue systems for real-world applications. To enrich and diversify the questions with both image content and commonsense knowledge, we propose a Knowledge-aware Remote Sensing Visual Question Generation model (KRSVQG). The proposed model incorporates related knowledge triplets from external knowledge sources to broaden the question content, while employing image captioning as an intermediary representation to ground questions to the corresponding images. Moreover, KRSVQG utilizes a vision-language pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, enabling the model's adaptation to low data regimes. To evaluate the proposed KRSVQG model, we construct two knowledge-aware remote sensing visual question generation datasets: the NWPU-300 dataset and the TextRS-300 dataset. Evaluations, including metrics and human assessment, demonstrate that KRSVQG outperforms existing methods and leads to rich questions, grounded in both image and domain knowledge. As a key practice in vision-language research, knowledge-aware visual question generation advances the understanding of image content beyond pixels, facilitating the development of knowledge-enriched vision-language systems with vision-grounded human commonsense.</description>

      <title>Controlled Face Manipulation and Synthesis for Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning vision models excel with abundant supervision, but many applications face label scarcity and class imbalance. Controllable image editing can augment scarce labeled data, yet edits often introduce artifacts and entangle non-target attributes. We study this in facial expression analysis, targeting Action Unit (AU) manipulation where annotation is costly and AU co-activation drives entanglement. We present a facial manipulation method that operates in the semantic latent space of a pre-trained face generator (Diffusion Autoencoder). Using lightweight linear models, we reduce entanglement of semantic features via (i) dependency-aware conditioning that accounts for AU co-activation, and (ii) orthogonal projection that removes nuisance attribute directions (e.g., glasses), together with an expression neutralization step to enable absolute AU edit. We use these edits to balance AU occurrence by editing labeled faces and to diversify identities/demographics via controlled synthesis. Augmenting AU detector training with the generated data improves accuracy and yields more disentangled predictions with fewer co-activation shortcuts, outperforming alternative data-efficient training strategies and suggesting improvements similar to what would require substantially more labeled data in our learning-curve analysis. Compared to prior methods, our edits are stronger, produce fewer artifacts, and preserve identity better.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-aware Visual Question Generation for Remote Sensing Images</title>

Abstract: With the rapid development of remote sensing image archives, asking questions about images has become an effective way of gathering specific information or performing image retrieval. However, automatically generated image-based questions tend to be simplistic and template-based, which hinders the real deployment of question answering or visual dialogue systems. To enrich and diversify the questions, we propose a knowledge-aware remote sensing visual question generation model, KRSVQG, that incorporates external knowledge related to the image content to improve the quality and contextual understanding of the generated questions. The model takes an image and a related knowledge triplet from external knowledge sources as inputs and leverages image captioning as an intermediary representation to enhance the image grounding of the generated questions. To assess the performance of KRSVQG, we utilized two datasets that we manually annotated: NWPU-300 and TextRS-300. Results on these two datasets demonstrate that KRSVQG outperforms existing methods and leads to knowledge-enriched questions, grounded in both image and domain knowledge.</description>

      <title>No Need For Real Anomaly: MLLM Empowered Zero-Shot Video Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collection and detection of video anomaly data has long been a challenging problem due to its rare occurrence and spatio-temporal scarcity. Existing video anomaly detection (VAD) methods under perform in open-world scenarios. Key contributing factors include limited dataset diversity, and inadequate understanding of context-dependent anomalous semantics. To address these issues, i) we propose LAVIDA, an end-to-end zero-shot video anomaly detection framework. ii) LAVIDA employs an Anomaly Exposure Sampler that transforms segmented objects into pseudo-anomalies to enhance model adaptability to unseen anomaly categories. It further integrates a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to bolster semantic comprehension capabilities. Additionally, iii) we design a token compression approach based on reverse attention to handle the spatio-temporal scarcity of anomalous patterns and decrease computational cost. The training process is conducted solely on pseudo anomalies without any VAD data. Evaluations across four benchmark VAD datasets demonstrate that LAVIDA achieves SOTA performance in both frame-level and pixel-level anomaly detection under the zero-shot setting. Our code is available in https://github.com/VitaminCreed/LAVIDA.</description>

      <title>RegionRoute: Regional Style Transfer with Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise spatial control in diffusion-based style transfer remains challenging. This challenge arises because diffusion models treat style as a global feature and lack explicit spatial grounding of style representations, making it difficult to restrict style application to specific objects or regions. To our knowledge, existing diffusion models are unable to perform true localized style transfer, typically relying on handcrafted masks or multi-stage post-processing that introduce boundary artifacts and limit generalization. To address this, we propose an attention-supervised diffusion framework that explicitly teaches the model where to apply a given style by aligning the attention scores of style tokens with object masks during training. Two complementary objectives, a Focus loss based on KL divergence and a Cover loss using binary cross-entropy, jointly encourage accurate localization and dense coverage. A modular LoRA-MoE design further enables efficient and scalable multi-style adaptation. To evaluate localized stylization, we introduce the Regional Style Editing Score, which measures Regional Style Matching through CLIP-based similarity within the target region and Identity Preservation via masked LPIPS and pixel-level consistency on unedited areas. Experiments show that our method achieves mask-free, single-object style transfer at inference, producing regionally accurate and visually coherent results that outperform existing diffusion-based editing approaches.</description>

      <title>DD-CAM: Minimal Sufficient Explanations for Vision Models Using Delta Debugging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a gradient-free framework for identifying minimal, sufficient, and decision-preserving explanations in vision models by isolating the smallest subset of representational units whose joint activation preserves predictions. Unlike existing approaches that aggregate all units, often leading to cluttered saliency maps, our approach, DD-CAM, identifies a 1-minimal subset whose joint activation suffices to preserve the prediction (i.e., removing any unit from the subset alters the prediction). To efficiently isolate minimal sufficient subsets, we adapt delta debugging, a systematic reduction strategy from software debugging, and configure its search strategy based on unit interactions in the classifier head: testing individual units for models with non-interacting units and testing unit combinations for models in which unit interactions exist. We then generate minimal, prediction-preserving saliency maps that highlight only the most essential features. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach can produce more faithful explanations and achieve higher localization accuracy than the state-of-the-art CAM-based approaches.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage Detection-Tracking Framework for Stable Apple Quality Inspection in Dense Conveyor-Belt Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial fruit inspection systems must operate reliably under dense multi-object interactions and continuous motion, yet most existing works evaluate detection or classification at the image level without ensuring temporal stability in video streams. We present a two-stage detection-tracking framework for stable multi-apple quality inspection in conveyor-belt environments. An orchard-trained YOLOv8 model performs apple localization, followed by ByteTrack multi-object tracking to maintain persistent identities. A ResNet18 defect classifier, fine-tuned on a healthy-defective fruit dataset, is applied to cropped apple regions. Track-level aggregation is introduced to enforce temporal consistency and reduce prediction oscillation across frames. We define video-level industrial metrics such as track-level defect ratio and temporal consistency to evaluate system robustness under realistic processing conditions. Results demonstrate improved stability compared to frame-wise inference, suggesting that integrating tracking is essential for practical automated fruit grading systems.</description>

      <title>MRI Contrast Enhancement Kinetics World Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical MRI contrast acquisition suffers from inefficient information yield, which presents as a mismatch between the risky and costly acquisition protocol and the fixed and sparse acquisition sequence. Applying world models to simulate the contrast enhancement kinetics in the human body enables continuous contrast-free dynamics. However, the low temporal resolution in MRI acquisition restricts the training of world models, leading to a sparsely sampled dataset. Directly training a generative model to capture the kinetics leads to two limitations: (a) Due to the absence of data on missing time, the model tends to overfit to irrelevant features, leading to content distortion. (b) Due to the lack of continuous temporal supervision, the model fails to learn the continuous kinetics law over time, causing temporal discontinuities. For the first time, we propose MRI Contrast Enhancement Kinetics World model (MRI CEKWorld) with SpatioTemporal Consistency Learning (STCL). For (a), guided by the spatial law that patient-level structures remain consistent during enhancement, we propose Latent Alignment Learning (LAL) that constructs a patient-specific template to constrain contents to align with this template. For (b), guided by the temporal law that the kinetics follow a consistent smooth trend, we propose Latent Difference Learning (LDL) which extends the unobserved intervals by interpolation and constrains smooth variations in the latent space among interpolated sequences. Extensive experiments on two datasets show our MRI CEKWorld achieves better realistic contents and kinetics. Codes will be available at https://github.com/DD0922/MRI-Contrast-Enhancement-Kinetics-World-Model.</description>

      <title>IPv2: An Improved Image Purification Strategy for Real-World Ultra-Low-Dose Lung CT Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The image purification strategy constructs an intermediate distribution with aligned anatomical structures, which effectively corrects the spatial misalignment between real-world ultra-low-dose CT and normal-dose CT images and significantly enhances the structural preservation ability of denoising models. However, this strategy exhibits two inherent limitations. First, it suppresses noise only in the chest wall and bone regions while leaving the image background untreated. Second, it lacks a dedicated mechanism for denoising the lung parenchyma. To address these issues, we systematically redesign the original image purification strategy and propose an improved version termed IPv2. The proposed strategy introduces three core modules, namely Remove Background, Add noise, and Remove noise. These modules endow the model with denoising capability in both background and lung tissue regions during training data construction and provide a more reasonable evaluation protocol through refined label construction at the testing stage. Extensive experiments on our previously established real-world patient lung CT dataset acquired at 2% radiation dose demonstrate that IPv2 consistently improves background suppression and lung parenchyma restoration across multiple mainstream denoising models. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/MonkeyDadLufy/Image-Purification-Strategy-v2.</description>

      <title>Pay Attention to CTC: Fast and Robust Pseudo-Labelling for Unified Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unified Speech Recognition (USR) has emerged as a semi-supervised framework for training a single model for audio, visual, and audiovisual speech recognition, achieving state-of-the-art results on in-distribution benchmarks. However, its reliance on autoregressive pseudo-labelling makes training expensive, while its decoupled supervision of CTC and attention branches increases susceptibility to self-reinforcing errors, particularly under distribution shifts involving longer sequences, noise, or unseen domains. We propose CTC-driven teacher forcing, where greedily decoded CTC pseudo-labels are fed into the decoder to generate attention targets in a single forward pass. Although these can be globally incoherent, in the pseudo-labelling setting they enable efficient and effective knowledge transfer. Because CTC and CTC-driven attention pseudo-labels have the same length, the decoder can predict both simultaneously, benefiting from the robustness of CTC and the expressiveness of attention without costly beam search. We further propose mixed sampling to mitigate the exposure bias of the decoder relying solely on CTC inputs. The resulting method, USR 2.0, halves training time, improves robustness to out-of-distribution inputs, and achieves state-of-the-art results on LRS3, LRS2, and WildVSR, surpassing USR and modality-specific self-supervised baselines.</description>

      <title>US-JEPA: A Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture for Medical Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging poses unique challenges for representation learning due to its inherently noisy acquisition process. The low signal-to-noise ratio and stochastic speckle patterns hinder standard self-supervised learning methods relying on a pixel-level reconstruction objective. Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) address this drawback by predicting masked latent representations rather than raw pixels. However, standard approaches depend on hyperparameter-brittle and computationally expensive online teachers updated via exponential moving average. We propose US-JEPA, a self-supervised framework that adopts the Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training (SALT) objective. By using a frozen, domain-specific teacher to provide stable latent targets, US-JEPA decouples student-teacher optimization and pushes the student to expand upon the semantic priors of the teacher. In addition, we provide the first rigorous comparison of all publicly available state-of-the-art ultrasound foundation models on UltraBench, a public dataset benchmark spanning multiple organs and pathological conditions. Under linear probing for diverse classification tasks, US-JEPA achieves performance competitive with or superior to domain-specific and universal vision foundation model baselines. Our results demonstrate that masked latent prediction provides a stable and efficient path toward robust ultrasound representations.</description>

      <title>DefenseSplat: Enhancing the Robustness of 3D Gaussian Splatting via Frequency-Aware Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for real-time and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from posed images. However, recent studies reveal its vulnerability to adversarial corruptions in input views, where imperceptible yet consistent perturbations can drastically degrade rendering quality, increase training and rendering time, and inflate memory usage, even leading to server denial-of-service. In our work, to mitigate this issue, we begin by analyzing the distinct behaviors of adversarial perturbations in the low- and high-frequency components of input images using wavelet transforms. Based on this observation, we design a simple yet effective frequency-aware defense strategy that reconstructs training views by filtering high-frequency noise while preserving low-frequency content. This approach effectively suppresses adversarial artifacts while maintaining the authenticity of the original scene. Notably, it does not significantly impair training on clean data, achieving a desirable trade-off between robustness and performance on clean inputs. Through extensive experiments under a wide range of attack intensities on multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method substantially enhances the robustness of 3DGS without access to clean ground-truth supervision. By highlighting and addressing the overlooked vulnerabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting, our work paves the way for more robust and secure 3D reconstructions.</description>

      <title>RetinaVision: XAI-Driven Augmented Regulation for Precise Retinal Disease Classification using deep learning framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early and accurate classification of retinal diseases is critical to counter vision loss and for guiding clinical management of retinal diseases. In this study, we proposed a deep learning method for retinal disease classification utilizing optical coherence tomography (OCT) images from the Retinal OCT Image Classification - C8 dataset (comprising 24,000 labeled images spanning eight conditions). Images were resized to 224x224 px and tested on convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures: Xception and InceptionV3. Data augmentation techniques (CutMix, MixUp) were employed to enhance model generalization. Additionally, we applied GradCAM and LIME for interpretability evaluation. We implemented this in a real-world scenario via our web application named RetinaVision. This study found that Xception was the most accurate network (95.25%), followed closely by InceptionV3 (94.82%). These results suggest that deep learning methods allow effective OCT retinal disease classification and highlight the importance of implementing accuracy and interpretability for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>MultiDiffSense: Diffusion-Based Multi-Modal Visuo-Tactile Image Generation Conditioned on Object Shape and Contact Pose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acquiring aligned visuo-tactile datasets is slow and costly, requiring specialised hardware and large-scale data collection. Synthetic generation is promising, but prior methods are typically single-modality, limiting cross-modal learning. We present MultiDiffSense, a unified diffusion model that synthesises images for multiple vision-based tactile sensors (ViTac, TacTip, ViTacTip) within a single architecture. Our approach uses dual conditioning on CAD-derived, pose-aligned depth maps and structured prompts that encode sensor type and 4-DoF contact pose, enabling controllable, physically consistent multi-modal synthesis. Evaluating on 8 objects (5 seen, 3 novel) and unseen poses, MultiDiffSense outperforms a Pix2Pix cGAN baseline in SSIM by +36.3% (ViTac), +134.6% (ViTacTip), and +64.7% (TacTip). For downstream 3-DoF pose estimation, mixing 50% synthetic with 50% real halves the required real data while maintaining competitive performance. MultiDiffSense alleviates the data-collection bottleneck in tactile sensing and enables scalable, controllable multi-modal dataset generation for robotic applications.</description>

      <title>UP-Fuse: Uncertainty-guided LiDAR-Camera Fusion for 3D Panoptic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDAR-camera fusion enhances 3D panoptic segmentation by leveraging camera images to complement sparse LiDAR scans, but it also introduces a critical failure mode. Under adverse conditions, degradation or failure of the camera sensor can significantly compromise the reliability of the perception system. To address this problem, we introduce UP-Fuse, a novel uncertainty-aware fusion framework in the 2D range-view that remains robust under camera sensor degradation, calibration drift, and sensor failure. Raw LiDAR data is first projected into the range-view and encoded by a LiDAR encoder, while camera features are simultaneously extracted and projected into the same shared space. At its core, UP-Fuse employs an uncertainty-guided fusion module that dynamically modulates cross-modal interaction using predicted uncertainty maps. These maps are learned by quantifying representational divergence under diverse visual degradations, ensuring that only reliable visual cues influence the fused representation. The fused range-view features are decoded by a novel hybrid 2D-3D transformer that mitigates spatial ambiguities inherent to the 2D projection and directly predicts 3D panoptic segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on Panoptic nuScenes, SemanticKITTI, and our introduced Panoptic Waymo benchmark demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of UP-Fuse, which maintains strong performance even under severe visual corruption or misalignment, making it well suited for robotic perception in safety-critical settings.</description>

      <title>PoseCraft: Tokenized 3D Body Landmark and Camera Conditioning for Photorealistic Human Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digitizing humans and synthesizing photorealistic avatars with explicit 3D pose and camera controls are central to VR, telepresence, and entertainment. Existing skinning-based workflows require laborious manual rigging or template-based fittings, while neural volumetric methods rely on canonical templates and re-optimization for each unseen pose. We present PoseCraft, a diffusion framework built around tokenized 3D interface: instead of relying only on rasterized geometry as 2D control images, we encode sparse 3D landmarks and camera extrinsics as discrete conditioning tokens and inject them into diffusion via cross-attention. Our approach preserves 3D semantics by avoiding 2D re-projection ambiguity under large pose and viewpoint changes, and produces photorealistic imagery that faithfully captures identity and appearance. To train and evaluate at scale, we also implement GenHumanRF, a data generation workflow that renders diverse supervision from volumetric reconstructions. Our experiments show that PoseCraft achieves significant perceptual quality improvement over diffusion-centric methods, and attains better or comparable metrics to latest volumetric rendering SOTA while better preserving fabric and hair details.</description>

      <title>MentalBlackboard: Evaluating Spatial Visualization via Mathematical Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial visualization is the mental ability to imagine, transform, and manipulate the spatial characteristics of objects and actions. This intelligence is a part of human cognition where actions and perception are connected on a mental level. To explore whether state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit this ability, we develop MentalBlackboard, an open-ended spatial visualization benchmark for Paper Folding and Hole Punching tests within two core tasks: prediction and planning. Our prediction experiments reveal that models struggle with applying symmetrical transformations, even when they predict the sequence of unfolding steps correctly. Also, rotations introduce a significant challenge to the physical situational awareness for models. The planning task reveals limitations of models in analyzing symmetrical relationships and in implementing the multi-stage symmetry process, with Claude Opus 4.1 achieving the highest planning score at an accuracy of 10\%. The top-performing model, o3, attains a peak performance of 71.6\% on the generalization task, which does not require spatial visualization but transfers spatial data; however, it achieves only 25\% accuracy on text-based prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Referring Layer Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise, object-aware control over visual content is essential for advanced image editing and compositional generation. Yet, most existing approaches operate on entire images holistically, limiting the ability to isolate and manipulate individual scene elements. In contrast, layered representations, where scenes are explicitly separated into objects, environmental context, and visual effects, provide a more intuitive and structured framework for interpreting and editing visual content. To bridge this gap and enable both compositional understanding and controllable editing, we introduce the Referring Layer Decomposition (RLD) task, which predicts complete RGBA layers from a single RGB image, conditioned on flexible user prompts, such as spatial inputs (e.g., points, boxes, masks), natural language descriptions, or combinations thereof. At the core is the RefLade, a large-scale dataset comprising 1.11M image-layer-prompt triplets produced by our scalable data engine, along with 100K manually curated, high-fidelity layers. Coupled with a perceptually grounded, human-preference-aligned automatic evaluation protocol, RefLade establishes RLD as a well-defined and benchmarkable research task. Building on this foundation, we present RefLayer, a simple baseline designed for prompt-conditioned layer decomposition, achieving high visual fidelity and semantic alignment. Extensive experiments show our approach enables effective training, reliable evaluation, and high-quality image decomposition, while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Detector-in-the-Loop Tracking: Active Memory Rectification for Stable Glottic Opening Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal stability in glottic opening localization remains challenging due to the complementary weaknesses of single-frame detectors and foundation-model trackers: the former lacks temporal context, while the latter suffers from memory drift. Specifically, in video laryngoscopy, rapid tissue deformation, occlusions, and visual ambiguities in emergency settings require a robust, temporally aware solution that can prevent progressive tracking errors. We propose Closed-Loop Memory Correction (CL-MC), a detector-in-the-loop framework that supervises Segment Anything Model 2(SAM2) through confidence-aligned state decisions and active memory rectification. High-confidence detections trigger semantic resets that overwrite corrupted tracker memory, effectively mitigating drift accumulation with a training-free foundation tracker in complex endoscopic scenes. On emergency intubation videos, CL-MC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing drift and missing rate compared with the SAM2 variants and open loop based methods. Our results establish memory correction as a crucial component for reliable clinical video tracking. Our code will be available in https://github.com/huayuww/CL-MR.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Data Augmentation with Multi-armed Bandit: Sample-Efficient Embedding Calibration for Implicit Pattern Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognizing implicit visual and textual patterns is essential in many real-world applications of modern AI. However, tackling long-tail pattern recognition tasks remains challenging for current pre-trained foundation models such as LLMs and VLMs. While finetuning pre-trained models can improve accuracy in recognizing implicit patterns, it is usually infeasible due to a lack of training data and high computational overhead. In this paper, we propose ADAMAB, an efficient embedding calibration framework for few-shot pattern recognition. To maximally reduce the computational costs, ADAMAB trains embedder-agnostic light-weight calibrators on top of fixed embedding models without accessing their parameters. To mitigate the need for large-scale training data, we introduce an adaptive data augmentation strategy based on the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) mechanism. With a modified upper confidence bound algorithm, ADAMAB diminishes the gradient shifting and offers theoretically guaranteed convergence in few-shot training. Our multi-modal experiments justify the superior performance of ADAMAB, with up to 40% accuracy improvement when training with less than 5 initial data samples of each class.</description>

      <title>Redefining the Down-Sampling Scheme of U-Net for Precision Biomedical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: U-Net architectures have been instrumental in advancing biomedical image segmentation (BIS) but often struggle with capturing long-range information. One reason is the conventional down-sampling techniques that prioritize computational efficiency at the expense of information retention. This paper introduces a simple but effective strategy, we call it Stair Pooling, which moderates the pace of down-sampling and reduces information loss by leveraging a sequence of concatenated small and narrow pooling operations in varied orientations. Specifically, our method modifies the reduction in dimensionality within each 2D pooling step from $\frac{1}{4}$ to $\frac{1}{2}$. This approach can also be adapted for 3D pooling to preserve even more information. Such preservation aids the U-Net in more effectively reconstructing spatial details during the up-sampling phase, thereby enhancing its ability to capture long-range information and improving segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments on three BIS benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Stair Pooling can increase both 2D and 3D U-Net performance by an average of 3.8\% in Dice scores. Moreover, we leverage the transfer entropy to select the optimal down-sampling paths and quantitatively show how the proposed Stair Pooling reduces the information loss.</description>

      <title>PA-Attack: Guiding Gray-Box Attacks on LVLM Vision Encoders with Prototypes and Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are foundational to modern multimodal applications, yet their susceptibility to adversarial attacks remains a critical concern. Prior white-box attacks rarely generalize across tasks, and black-box methods depend on expensive transfer, which limits efficiency. The vision encoder, standardized and often shared across LVLMs, provides a stable gray-box pivot with strong cross-model transfer. Building on this premise, we introduce PA-Attack (Prototype-Anchored Attentive Attack). PA-Attack begins with a prototype-anchored guidance that provides a stable attack direction towards a general and dissimilar prototype, tackling the attribute-restricted issue and limited task generalization of vanilla attacks. Building on this, we propose a two-stage attention enhancement mechanism: (i) leverage token-level attention scores to concentrate perturbations on critical visual tokens, and (ii) adaptively recalibrate attention weights to track the evolving attention during the adversarial process. Extensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks and LVLM architectures show that PA-Attack achieves an average 75.1% score reduction rate (SRR), demonstrating strong attack effectiveness, efficiency, and task generalization in LVLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hefeimei06/PA-Attack.</description>

      <title>Prefer-DAS: Learning from Local Preferences and Sparse Prompts for Domain Adaptive Segmentation of Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain adaptive segmentation (DAS) is a promising paradigm for delineating intracellular structures from various large-scale electron microscopy (EM) without incurring extensive annotated data in each domain. However, the prevalent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) strategies often demonstrate limited and biased performance, which hinders their practical applications. In this study, we explore sparse points and local human preferences as weak labels in the target domain, thereby presenting a more realistic yet annotation-efficient setting. Specifically, we develop Prefer-DAS, which pioneers sparse promptable learning and local preference alignment. The Prefer-DAS is a promptable multitask model that integrates self-training and prompt-guided contrastive learning. Unlike SAM-like methods, the Prefer-DAS allows for the use of full, partial, and even no point prompts during both training and inference stages and thus enables interactive segmentation. Instead of using image-level human preference alignment for segmentation, we introduce Local direct Preference Optimization (LPO) and sparse LPO (SLPO), plug-and-play solutions for alignment with spatially varying human feedback or sparse feedback. To address potential missing feedback, we also introduce Unsupervised Preference Optimization (UPO), which leverages self-learned preferences. As a result, the Prefer-DAS model can effectively perform both weakly-supervised and unsupervised DAS, depending on the availability of points and human preferences. Comprehensive experiments on four challenging DAS tasks demonstrate that our model outperforms SAM-like methods as well as unsupervised and weakly-supervised DAS methods in both automatic and interactive segmentation modes, highlighting strong generalizability and flexibility. Additionally, the performance of our model is very close to or even exceeds that of supervised models.</description>

      <title>Hepato-LLaVA: An Expert MLLM with Sparse Topo-Pack Attention for Hepatocellular Pathology Analysis on Whole Slide Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hepatocellular Carcinoma diagnosis relies heavily on the interpretation of gigapixel Whole Slide Images. However, current computational approaches are constrained by fixed-resolution processing mechanisms and inefficient feature aggregation, which inevitably lead to either severe information loss or high feature redundancy. To address these challenges, we propose Hepato-LLaVA, a specialized Multi-modal Large Language Model designed for fine-grained hepatocellular pathology analysis. We introduce a novel Sparse Topo-Pack Attention mechanism that explicitly models 2D tissue topology. This mechanism effectively aggregates local diagnostic evidence into semantic summary tokens while preserving global context. Furthermore, to overcome the lack of multi-scale data, we present HepatoPathoVQA, a clinically grounded dataset comprising 33K hierarchically structured question-answer pairs validated by expert pathologists. Our experiments demonstrate that Hepato-LLaVA achieves state-of-the-art performance on HCC diagnosis and captioning tasks, significantly outperforming existing methods. Our code and implementation details are available at https://pris-cv.github.io/Hepto-LLaVA/.</description>

      <title>TherA: Thermal-Aware Visual-Language Prompting for Controllable RGB-to-Thermal Infrared Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the inherent advantages of thermal infrared(TIR) imaging, large-scale data collection and annotation remain a major bottleneck for TIR-based perception. A practical alternative is to synthesize pseudo TIR data via image translation; however, most RGB-to-TIR approaches heavily rely on RGB-centric priors that overlook thermal physics, yielding implausible heat distributions. In this paper, we introduce TherA, a controllable RGB-to-TIR translation framework that produces diverse and thermally plausible images at both scene and object level. TherA couples TherA-VLM with a latent-diffusion-based translator. Given a single RGB image and a user-prompted condition pair, TherA-VLM yields a thermal-aware embedding that encodes scene, object, material, and heat-emission context reflecting the input scene-condition pair. Conditioning the diffusion model on this embedding enables realistic TIR synthesis and fine-grained control across time of day, weather, and object state. Compared to other baselines, TherA achieves state-of-the-art translation performance, demonstrating improved zero-shot translation performance up to 33% increase averaged across all metrics.</description>

      <title>CountEx: Fine-Grained Counting via Exemplars and Exclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents CountEx, a discriminative visual counting framework designed to address a key limitation of existing prompt-based methods: the inability to explicitly exclude visually similar distractors. While current approaches allow users to specify what to count via inclusion prompts, they often struggle in cluttered scenes with confusable object categories, leading to ambiguity and overcounting. CountEx enables users to express both inclusion and exclusion intent, specifying what to count and what to ignore, through multimodal prompts including natural language descriptions and optional visual exemplars. At the core of CountEx is a novel Discriminative Query Refinement module, which jointly reasons over inclusion and exclusion cues by first identifying shared visual features, then isolating exclusion-specific patterns, and finally applying selective suppression to refine the counting query. To support systematic evaluation of fine-grained counting methods, we introduce CoCount, a benchmark comprising 1,780 videos and 10,086 annotated frames across 97 category pairs. Experiments show that CountEx achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods for counting objects from both known and novel categories. The data and code are available at https://github.com/bbvisual/CountEx.</description>

      <title>FinSight-Net:A Physics-Aware Decoupled Network with Frequency-Domain Compensation for Underwater Fish Detection in Smart Aquaculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater fish detection (UFD) is a core capability for smart aquaculture and marine ecological monitoring. While recent detectors improve accuracy by stacking feature extractors or introducing heavy attention modules, they often incur substantial computational overhead and, more importantly, neglect the physics that fundamentally limits UFD: wavelength-dependent absorption and turbidity-induced scattering significantly degrade contrast, blur fine structures, and introduce backscattering noise, leading to unreliable localization and recognition. To address these challenges, we propose FinSight-Net, an efficient and physics-aware detection framework tailored for complex aquaculture environments. FinSight-Net introduces a Multi-Scale Decoupled Dual-Stream Processing (MS-DDSP) bottleneck that explicitly targets frequency-specific information loss via heterogeneous convolutional branches, suppressing backscattering artifacts while compensating distorted biological cues through scale-aware and channel-weighted pathways. We further design an Efficient Path Aggregation FPN (EPA-FPN) as a detail-filling mechanism: it restores high-frequency spatial information typically attenuated in deep layers by establishing long-range skip connections and pruning redundant fusion routes, enabling robust detection of non-rigid fish targets under severe blur and turbidity. Extensive experiments on DeepFish, AquaFishSet, and our challenging UW-BlurredFish benchmark demonstrate that FinSight-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance. In particular, on UW-BlurredFish, FinSight-Net reaches 92.8% mAP, outperforming YOLOv11s by 4.8% while reducing parameters by 29.0%, providing a strong and lightweight solution for real-time automated monitoring in smart aquaculture.</description>

      <title>UrbanAlign: Post-hoc Semantic Calibration for VLM-Human Preference Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning vision-language model (VLM) outputs with human preferences in domain-specific tasks typically requires fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, both of which demand labelled data and GPU compute. We show that for subjective perception tasks, this alignment can be achieved without any model training: VLMs are already strong concept extractors but poor decision calibrators, and the gap can be closed externally. We propose a training-free post-hoc concept-bottleneck pipeline consisting of three tightly coupled stages: concept mining, multi-agent structured scoring, and geometric calibration, unified by an end-to-end dimension optimization loop. Interpretable evaluation dimensions are mined from a handful of human annotations; an Observer-Debater-Judge chain extracts robust continuous concept scores from a frozen VLM; and locally-weighted ridge regression on a hybrid visual-semantic manifold calibrates these scores against human ratings. Applied to urban perception as UrbanAlign, the framework achieves 72.2% accuracy ($\kappa=0.45$) on Place Pulse 2.0 across six categories, outperforming the best supervised baseline by +15.1 pp and uncalibrated VLM scoring by +16.3 pp, with full dimension-level interpretability and zero model-weight modification.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Vision and Language: Codebook Anchored Visual Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) use their vision encoders to translate images into representations for downstream reasoning, but the encoders often underperform in domain-specific visual tasks such as medical image diagnosis or fine-grained classification, where representation errors can cascade through the language model, leading to incorrect responses. Existing adaptation methods modify the continuous feature interface between encoder and language model through projector tuning or other parameter-efficient updates, which still couples the two components and requires re-alignment whenever the encoder changes. We introduce CRAFT (Codebook RegulAted Fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that fine-tunes the encoder using a discrete codebook that anchors visual representations to a stable token space, achieving domain adaptation without modifying other parts of the model. This decoupled design allows the adapted encoder to seamlessly boost the performance of LVLMs with different language architectures, as long as they share the same codebook. Empirically, CRAFT achieves an average gain of 13.51% across 10 domain-specific benchmarks such as VQARAD and PlantVillage, while preserving the LLM's linguistic capabilities and outperforming peer methods that operate on continuous tokens.</description>

      <title>HD-TTA: Hypothesis-Driven Test-Time Adaptation for Safer Brain Tumor Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods typically treat inference as a blind optimization task, applying generic objectives to all or filtered test samples. In safety-critical medical segmentation, this lack of selectivity often causes the tumor mask to spill into healthy brain tissue or degrades predictions that were already correct. We propose Hypothesis-Driven TTA, a novel framework that reformulates adaptation as a dynamic decision process. Rather than forcing a single optimization trajectory, our method generates intuitive competing geometric hypotheses: compaction (is the prediction noisy? trim artifacts) versus inflation (is the valid tumor under-segmented? safely inflate to recover). It then employs a representation-guided selector to autonomously identify the safest outcome based on intrinsic texture consistency. Additionally, a pre-screening Gatekeeper prevents negative transfer by skipping adaptation on confident cases. We validate this proof-of-concept on a cross-domain binary brain tumor segmentation task, applying a source model trained on adult BraTS gliomas to unseen pediatric and more challenging meningioma target domains. HD-TTA improves safety-oriented outcomes (Hausdorff Distance (HD95) and Precision) over several state-of-the-art representative baselines in the challenging safety regime, reducing the HD95 by approximately 6.4 mm and improving Precision by over 4%, while maintaining comparable Dice scores. These results demonstrate that resolving the safety-adaptation trade-off via explicit hypothesis selection is a viable, robust path for safe clinical model deployment. Code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Laplacian Multi-scale Flow Matching for Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Laplacian multiscale flow matching (LapFlow), a novel framework that enhances flow matching by leveraging multi-scale representations for image generative modeling. Our approach decomposes images into Laplacian pyramid residuals and processes different scales in parallel through a mixture-of-transformers (MoT) architecture with causal attention mechanisms. Unlike previous cascaded approaches that require explicit renoising between scales, our model generates multi-scale representations in parallel, eliminating the need for bridging processes. The proposed multi-scale architecture not only improves generation quality but also accelerates the sampling process and promotes scaling flow matching methods. Through extensive experimentation on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet, we demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample quality with fewer GFLOPs and faster inference compared to single-scale and multi-scale flow matching baselines. The proposed model scales effectively to high-resolution generation (up to 1024$\times$1024) while maintaining lower computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Active Polarimetric 3D Imaging for Specular Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D imaging of specular surfaces remains challenging in real-world scenarios, such as in-line inspection or hand-held scanning, requiring fast and accurate measurement of complex geometries. Optical metrology techniques such as deflectometry achieve high accuracy but typically rely on multi-shot acquisition, making them unsuitable for dynamic environments. Fourier-based single-shot approaches alleviate this constraint, yet their performance deteriorates when measuring surfaces with high spatial frequency structure or large curvature. Alternatively, polarimetric 3D imaging in computer vision operates in a single-shot fashion and exhibits robustness to geometric complexity. However, its accuracy is fundamentally limited by the orthographic imaging assumption. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework for single-shot 3D imaging of complex specular surfaces. Polarization cues provide orientation priors that assist in interpreting geometric information encoded by structured illumination. These complementary cues are processed through a dual-encoder architecture with mutual feature modulation, allowing the network to resolve their nonlinear coupling and directly infer surface normals. The proposed method achieves accurate and robust normal estimation in single-shot with fast inference, enabling practical 3D imaging of complex specular surfaces.</description>

      <title>Forgetting-Resistant and Lesion-Aware Source-Free Domain Adaptive Fundus Image Analysis with Vision-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a model trained in the source domain to perform well in the target domain, with only unlabeled target domain data and the source model. Taking into account that conventional SFDA methods are inevitably error-prone under domain shift, recently greater attention has been directed to SFDA assisted with off-the-shelf foundation models, e.g., vision-language (ViL) models. However, existing works of leveraging ViL models for SFDA confront two issues: (i) Although mutual information is exploited to consider the joint distribution between the predictions of ViL model and the target model, we argue that the forgetting of some superior predictions of the target model still occurs, as indicated by the decline of the accuracies of certain classes during adaptation; (ii) Prior research disregards the rich, fine-grained knowledge embedded in the ViL model, which offers detailed grounding for fundus image diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce a novel forgetting-resistant and lesion-aware (FRLA) method for SFDA of fundus image diagnosis with ViL model. Specifically, a forgetting-resistant adaptation module explicitly preserves the confident predictions of the target model, and a lesion-aware adaptation module yields patch-wise predictions from ViL model and employs them to help the target model be aware of the lesion areas and leverage the ViL model's fine-grained knowledge. Extensive experiments show that our method not only significantly outperforms the vision-language model, but also achieves consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be released.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Label-Independent Regularization from Spatial Dependencies for Whole Slide Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whole slide images, with their gigapixel-scale panoramas of tissue samples, are pivotal for precise disease diagnosis. However, their analysis is hindered by immense data size and scarce annotations. Existing MIL methods face challenges due to the fundamental imbalance where a single bag-level label must guide the learning of numerous patch-level features. This sparse supervision makes it difficult to reliably identify discriminative patches during training, leading to unstable optimization and suboptimal solutions. We propose a spatially regularized MIL framework that leverages inherent spatial relationships among patch features as label-independent regularization signals. Our approach learns a shared representation space by jointly optimizing feature-induced spatial reconstruction and label-guided classification objectives, enforcing consistency between intrinsic structural patterns and supervisory signals. Experimental results on multiple public datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, offering a promising direction.</description>

      <title>MICON-Bench: Benchmarking and Enhancing Multi-Image Context Image Generation in Unified Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have enabled remarkable image understanding and generation capabilities. However, while models like Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image show emerging abilities to reason over multiple related images, existing benchmarks rarely address the challenges of multi-image context generation, focusing mainly on text-to-image or single-image editing tasks. In this work, we introduce \textbf{MICON-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark covering six tasks that evaluate cross-image composition, contextual reasoning, and identity preservation. We further propose an MLLM-driven Evaluation-by-Checkpoint framework for automatic verification of semantic and visual consistency, where multimodal large language model (MLLM) serves as a verifier. Additionally, we present \textbf{Dynamic Attention Rebalancing (DAR)}, a training-free, plug-and-play mechanism that dynamically adjusts attention during inference to enhance coherence and reduce hallucinations. Extensive experiments on various state-of-the-art open-source models demonstrate both the rigor of MICON-Bench in exposing multi-image reasoning challenges and the efficacy of DAR in improving generation quality and cross-image coherence.

      <title>A Text-Guided Vision Model for Enhanced Recognition of Small Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As drone-based object detection technology continues to evolve, the demand is shifting from merely detecting objects to enabling users to accurately identify specific targets. For example, users can input particular targets as prompts to precisely detect desired objects. To address this need, an efficient text-guided object detection model has been developed to enhance the detection of small objects. Specifically, an improved version of the existing YOLO-World model is introduced. The proposed method replaces the C2f layer in the YOLOv8 backbone with a C3k2 layer, enabling more precise representation of local features, particularly for small objects or those with clearly defined boundaries. Additionally, the proposed architecture improves processing speed and efficiency through parallel processing optimization, while also contributing to a more lightweight model design. Comparative experiments on the VisDrone dataset show that the proposed model outperforms the original YOLO-World model, with precision increasing from 40.6% to 41.6%, recall from 30.8% to 31%, F1 score from 35% to 35.5%, and mAP@0.5 from 30.4% to 30.7%, confirming its enhanced accuracy. Furthermore, the model demonstrates superior lightweight performance, with the parameter count reduced from 4 million to 3.8 million and FLOPs decreasing from 15.7 billion to 15.2 billion. These results indicate that the proposed approach provides a practical and effective solution for precise object detection in drone-based applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose ControlMLLM++, a novel test-time adaptation framework that injects learnable visual prompts into frozen multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable fine-grained region-based visual reasoning without any model retraining or fine-tuning. Leveraging the insight that cross-modal attention maps intrinsically encode semantic correspondences between textual tokens and visual regions, ControlMLLM++ optimizes a latent visual token modifier during inference via a task-specific energy function to steer model attention towards user-specified areas. To enhance optimization stability and mitigate language prompt biases, ControlMLLM++ incorporates an improved optimization strategy (Optim++) and a prompt debiasing mechanism (PromptDebias). Supporting diverse visual prompt types including bounding boxes, masks, scribbles, and points, our method demonstrates strong out-of-domain generalization and interpretability.

      <title>Relational Feature Caching for Accelerating Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature caching approaches accelerate diffusion transformers (DiTs) by storing the output features of computationally expensive modules at certain timesteps, and exploiting them for subsequent steps to reduce redundant computations. Recent forecasting-based caching approaches employ temporal extrapolation techniques to approximate the output features with cached ones. Although effective, relying exclusively on temporal extrapolation still suffers from significant prediction errors, leading to performance degradation. Through a detailed analysis, we find that 1) these errors stem from the irregular magnitude of changes in the output features, and 2) an input feature of a module is strongly correlated with the corresponding output. Based on this, we propose relational feature caching (RFC), a novel framework that leverages the input-output relationship to enhance the accuracy of the feature prediction. Specifically, we introduce relational feature estimation (RFE) to estimate the magnitude of changes in the output features from the inputs, enabling more accurate feature predictions. We also present relational cache scheduling (RCS), which estimates the prediction errors using the input features and performs full computations only when the errors are expected to be substantial. Extensive experiments across various DiT models demonstrate that RFC consistently outperforms prior approaches significantly.

      <title>OSInsert: Towards High-authenticity and High-fidelity Image Composition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative image composition aims to regenerate the given foreground object in the background image to produce a realistic composite image. Some high-authenticity methods can adjust foreground pose/view to be compatible with background, while some high-fidelity methods can preserve the foreground details accurately. However, existing methods can hardly achieve both goals at the same time. In this work, we propose a two-stage strategy to achieve both goals. In the first stage, we use high-authenticity method to generate reasonable foreground shape, serving as the condition of high-fidelity method in the second stage. The experiments on MureCOM dataset verify the effectiveness of our two-stage strategy. The code and model have been released at https://github.com/bcmi/OSInsert-Image-Composition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization across diverse tasks, yet their performance remains constrained by the quality and geometry of the textual prototypes used to represent classes. Standard zero shot classifiers, derived from frozen text encoders and handcrafted prompts, may yield correlated or weakly separated embeddings that limit task specific discriminability. We introduce ORION, a text encoder fine tuning framework that improves pretrained VLMs using only class names. Our method optimizes, via low rank adaptation, a novel loss integrating two terms, one promoting pairwise orthogonality between the textual representations of the classes of a given task and the other penalizing deviations from the initial class prototypes. Furthermore, we provide a probabilistic interpretation of our orthogonality penalty, connecting it to the general maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) principle via Huygens theorem. We report extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks and three large VLM backbones, showing that the refined textual embeddings yield powerful replacements for the standard CLIP prototypes. Added as plug and play module on top of various state of the art methods, and across different prediction settings (zero shot, few shot and test time adaptation), ORION improves the performance consistently and significantly.</description>

      <title>Fore-Mamba3D: Mamba-based Foreground-Enhanced Encoding for 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear modeling methods like Mamba have been merged as the effective backbone for the 3D object detection task. However, previous Mamba-based methods utilize the bidirectional encoding for the whole non-empty voxel sequence, which contains abundant useless background information in the scenes. Though directly encoding foreground voxels appears to be a plausible solution, it tends to degrade detection performance. We attribute this to the response attenuation and restricted context representation in the linear modeling for fore-only sequences. To address this problem, we propose a novel backbone, termed Fore-Mamba3D, to focus on the foreground enhancement by modifying Mamba-based encoder. The foreground voxels are first sampled according to the predicted scores. Considering the response attenuation existing in the interaction of foreground voxels across different instances, we design a regional-to-global slide window (RGSW) to propagate the information from regional split to the entire sequence. Furthermore, a semantic-assisted and state spatial fusion module (SASFMamba) is proposed to enrich contextual representation by enhancing semantic and geometric awareness within the Mamba model. Our method emphasizes foreground-only encoding and alleviates the distance-based and causal dependencies in the linear autoregression model. The superior performance across various benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of Fore-Mamba3D in the 3D object detection task.</description>

      <title>Can a Teenager Fool an AI? Evaluating Low-Cost Cosmetic Attacks on Age Estimation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Age estimation systems are increasingly deployed as gatekeepers for age-restricted online content, yet their robustness to cosmetic modifications has not been systematically evaluated. We investigate whether simple, household-accessible cosmetic changes, including beards, grey hair, makeup, and simulated wrinkles, can cause AI age estimators to classify minors as adults. To study this threat at scale without ethical concerns, we simulate these physical attacks on 329 facial images of individuals aged 10 to 21 using a VLM image editor (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image). We then evaluate eight models from our prior benchmark: five specialized architectures (MiVOLO, Custom-Best, Herosan, MiViaLab, DEX) and three vision-language models (Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-5-Nano). We introduce the Attack Conversion Rate (ACR), defined as the fraction of images predicted as minor at baseline that flip to adult after attack, a population-agnostic metric that does not depend on the ratio of minors to adults in the test set. Our results reveal that a synthetic beard alone achieves 28 to 69 percent ACR across all eight models; combining all four attacks shifts predicted age by +7.7 years on average across all 329 subjects and reaches up to 83 percent ACR; and vision-language models exhibit lower ACR (59 to 71 percent) than specialized models (63 to 83 percent) under the full attack, although the ACR ranges overlap and the difference is not statistically tested. These findings highlight a critical vulnerability in deployed age-verification pipelines and call for adversarial robustness evaluation as a mandatory criterion for model selection.</description>

      <title>A Green Learning Approach to LDCT Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a green learning (GL) approach to restore medical images. Without loss of generality, we use low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) images as examples. LDCT images are susceptible to noise and artifacts, where the imaging process introduces distortion. LDCT image restoration is an important preprocessing step for further medical analysis. Deep learning (DL) methods have been developed to solve this problem. We examine an alternative solution using the Green Learning (GL) methodology. The new restoration method is characterized by mathematical transparency, computational and memory efficiency, and high performance. Experiments show that our GL method offers state-of-the-art restoration performance at a smaller model size and with lower inference complexity.</description>

      <title>Vinedresser3D: Agentic Text-guided 3D Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-guided 3D editing aims to modify existing 3D assets using natural-language instructions. Current methods struggle to jointly understand complex prompts, automatically localize edits in 3D, and preserve unedited content. We introduce Vinedresser3D, an agentic framework for high-quality text-guided 3D editing that operates directly in the latent space of a native 3D generative model. Given a 3D asset and an editing prompt, Vinedresser3D uses a multimodal large language model to infer rich descriptions of the original asset, identify the edit region and edit type (addition, modification, deletion), and generate decomposed structural and appearance-level text guidance. The agent then selects an informative view and applies an image editing model to obtain visual guidance. Finally, an inversion-based rectified-flow inpainting pipeline with an interleaved sampling module performs editing in the 3D latent space, enforcing prompt alignment while maintaining 3D coherence and unedited regions. Experiments on diverse 3D edits demonstrate that Vinedresser3D outperforms prior baselines in both automatic metrics and human preference studies, while enabling precise, coherent, and mask-free 3D editing.</description>

      <title>DICArt: Advancing Category-level Articulated Object Pose Estimation in Discrete State-Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Articulated object pose estimation is a core task in embodied AI. Existing methods typically regress poses in a continuous space, but often struggle with 1) navigating a large, complex search space and 2) failing to incorporate intrinsic kinematic constraints. In this work, we introduce DICArt (DIsCrete Diffusion for Articulation Pose Estimation), a novel framework that formulates pose estimation as a conditional discrete diffusion process. Instead of operating in a continuous domain, DICArt progressively denoises a noisy pose representation through a learned reverse diffusion procedure to recover the GT pose. To improve modeling fidelity, we propose a flexible flow decider that dynamically determines whether each token should be denoised or reset, effectively balancing the real and noise distributions during diffusion. Additionally, we incorporate a hierarchical kinematic coupling strategy, estimating the pose of each rigid part hierarchically to respect the object's kinematic structure. We validate DICArt on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance and robustness. By integrating discrete generative modeling with structural priors, DICArt offers a new paradigm for reliable category-level 6D pose estimation in complex environments.</description>

      <title>VALD: Multi-Stage Vision Attack Detection for Efficient LVLM Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can be vulnerable to adversarial images that subtly bias their outputs toward plausible yet incorrect responses. We introduce a general, efficient, and training-free defense that combines image transformations with agentic data consolidation to recover correct model behavior. A key component of our approach is a two-stage detection mechanism that quickly filters out the majority of clean inputs. We first assess image consistency under content-preserving transformations at negligible computational cost. For more challenging cases, we examine discrepancies in a text-embedding space. Only when necessary do we invoke a powerful LLM to resolve attack-induced divergences. A key idea is to consolidate multiple responses, leveraging both their similarities and their differences. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining notable efficiency: most clean images skip costly processing, and even in the presence of numerous adversarial examples, the overhead remains minimal.</description>

      <title>HOCA-Bench: Beyond Semantic Perception to Predictive World Modeling via Hegelian Ontological-Causal Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video-LLMs have improved steadily on semantic perception, but they still fall short on predictive world modeling, which is central to physically grounded intelligence. We introduce HOCA-Bench, a benchmark that frames physical anomalies through a Hegelian lens. HOCA-Bench separates anomalies into two types: ontological anomalies, where an entity violates its own definition or persistence, and causal anomalies, where interactions violate physical relations. Using state-of-the-art generative video models as adversarial simulators, we build a testbed of 1,439 videos (3,470 QA pairs). Evaluations on 17 Video-LLMs show a clear cognitive lag: models often identify static ontological violations (e.g., shape mutations) but struggle with causal mechanisms (e.g., gravity or friction), with performance dropping by more than 20% on causal tasks. System-2 "Thinking" modes improve reasoning, but they do not close the gap, suggesting that current architectures recognize visual patterns more readily than they apply basic physical laws.</description>

      <title>ConceptPrism: Concept Disentanglement in Personalized Diffusion Models via Residual Token Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation suffers from concept entanglement, where irrelevant residual information from reference images is captured, leading to a trade-off between concept fidelity and text alignment. Recent disentanglement approaches attempt to solve this utilizing manual guidance, such as linguistic cues or segmentation masks, which limits their applicability and fails to fully articulate the target concept. In this paper, we propose ConceptPrism, a novel framework that automatically disentangles the shared visual concept from image-specific residuals by comparing images within a set. Our method jointly optimizes a target token and image-wise residual tokens using two complementary objectives: a reconstruction loss to ensure fidelity, and a novel exclusion loss that compels residual tokens to discard the shared concept. This process allows the target token to capture the pure concept without direct supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConceptPrism effectively resolves concept entanglement, achieving a significantly improved trade-off between fidelity and alignment.</description>

      <title>Learning Mutual View Information Graph for Adaptive Adversarial Collaborative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative perception (CP) enables data sharing among connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to enhance driving safety. However, CP systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks where malicious agents forge false objects via feature-level perturbations. Current defensive systems use threshold-based consensus verification by comparing collaborative and ego detection results. Yet, these defenses remain vulnerable to more sophisticated attack strategies that could exploit two critical weaknesses: (i) lack of robustness against attacks with systematic timing and target region optimization, and (ii) inadvertent disclosure of vulnerability knowledge through implicit confidence information in shared collaboration data. In this paper, we propose MVIG attack, a novel adaptive adversarial CP framework learning to capture vulnerability knowledge disclosed by different defensive CP systems from a unified mutual view information graph (MVIG) representation. Our approach combines MVIG representation with temporal graph learning to generate evolving fabrication risk maps and employs entropy-aware vulnerability search to optimize attack location, timing and persistence, enabling adaptive attacks with generalizability across various defensive configurations. Extensive evaluations on OPV2V and Adv-OPV2V datasets demonstrate that MVIG attack reduces defense success rates by up to 62\% against state-of-the-art defenses while achieving 47\% lower detection for persistent attacks at 29.9 FPS, exposing critical security gaps in CP systems.

      <title>CLCR: Cross-Level Semantic Collaborative Representation for Multimodal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to capture both shared and private information from multiple modalities. However, existing methods that project all modalities into a single latent space for fusion often overlook the asynchronous, multi-level semantic structure of multimodal data. This oversight induces semantic misalignment and error propagation, thereby degrading representation quality. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Level Co-Representation (CLCR), which explicitly organizes each modality's features into a three-level semantic hierarchy and specifies level-wise constraints for cross-modal interactions. First, a semantic hierarchy encoder aligns shallow, mid, and deep features across modalities, establishing a common basis for interaction. And then, at each level, an Intra-Level Co-Exchange Domain (IntraCED) factorizes features into shared and private subspaces and restricts cross-modal attention to the shared subspace via a learnable token budget. This design ensures that only shared semantics are exchanged and prevents leakage from private channels. To integrate information across levels, the Inter-Level Co-Aggregation Domain (InterCAD) synchronizes semantic scales using learned anchors, selectively fuses the shared representations, and gates private cues to form a compact task representation. We further introduce regularization terms to enforce separation of shared and private features and to minimize cross-level interference. Experiments on six benchmarks spanning emotion recognition, event localization, sentiment analysis, and action recognition show that CLCR achieves strong performance and generalizes well across tasks.</description>

      <title>Satellite-Based Detection of Looted Archaeological Sites Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Looting at archaeological sites poses a severe risk to cultural heritage, yet monitoring thousands of remote locations remains operationally difficult. We present a scalable and satellite-based pipeline to detect looted archaeological sites, using PlanetScope monthly mosaics (4.7m/pixel) and a curated dataset of 1,943 archaeological sites in Afghanistan (898 looted, 1,045 preserved) with multi-year imagery (2016--2023) and site-footprint masks. We compare (i) end-to-end CNN classifiers trained on raw RGB patches and (ii) traditional machine learning (ML) trained on handcrafted spectral/texture features and embeddings from recent remote-sensing foundation models. Results indicate that ImageNet-pretrained CNNs combined with spatial masking reach an F1 score of 0.926, clearly surpassing the strongest traditional ML setup, which attains an F1 score of 0.710 using SatCLIP-V+RF+Mean, i.e., location and vision embeddings fed into a Random Forest with mean-based temporal aggregation. Ablation studies demonstrate that ImageNet pretraining (even in the presence of domain shift) and spatial masking enhance performance. In contrast, geospatial foundation model embeddings perform competitively with handcrafted features, suggesting that looting signatures are extremely localized.

      <title>RAID: Retrieval-Augmented Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) aims to identify abnormal regions by establishing correspondences between test images and normal templates. Existing methods primarily rely on image reconstruction or template retrieval but face a fundamental challenge: matching between test images and normal templates inevitably introduces noise due to intra-class variations, imperfect correspondences, and limited templates. Observing that Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages retrieved samples directly in the generation process, we reinterpret UAD through this lens and introduce \textbf{RAID}, a retrieval-augmented UAD framework designed for noise-resilient anomaly detection and localization. Unlike standard RAG that enriches context or knowledge, we focus on using retrieved normal samples to guide noise suppression in anomaly map generation. RAID retrieves class-, semantic-, and instance-level representations from a hierarchical vector database, forming a coarse-to-fine pipeline. A matching cost volume correlates the input with retrieved exemplars, followed by a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network that leverages the retrieved samples to adaptively suppress matching noise and produce fine-grained anomaly maps. RAID achieves state-of-the-art performance across full-shot, few-shot, and multi-dataset settings on MVTec, VisA, MPDD, and BTAD benchmarks. \href{https://github.com/Mingxiu-Cai/RAID}{https://github.com/Mingxiu-Cai/RAID}.</description>

      <title>Seeing Clearly, Reasoning Confidently: Plug-and-Play Remedies for Vision Language Model Blindness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in broad visual understanding, yet they remain challenged by object-centric reasoning on rare objects due to the scarcity of such instances in pretraining data. While prior efforts alleviate this issue by retrieving additional data or introducing stronger vision encoders, these methods are still computationally intensive during finetuning VLMs and don't fully exploit the original training data. In this paper, we introduce an efficient plug-and-play module that substantially improves VLMs' reasoning over rare objects by refining visual tokens and enriching input text prompts, without VLMs finetuning. Specifically, we propose to learn multi-modal class embeddings for rare objects by leveraging prior knowledge from vision foundation models and synonym-augmented text descriptions, compensating for limited training examples. These embeddings refine the visual tokens in VLMs through a lightweight attention-based enhancement module that improves fine-grained object details. In addition, we use the learned embeddings as object-aware detectors to generate informative hints, which are injected into the text prompts to help guide the VLM's attention toward relevant image regions. Experiments on two benchmarks show consistent and substantial gains for pretrained VLMs in rare object recognition and reasoning. Further analysis reveals how our method strengthens the VLM's ability to focus on and reason about rare objects.</description>

      <title>PedaCo-Gen: Scaffolding Pedagogical Agency in Human-AI Collaborative Video Authoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While advancements in Text-to-Video (T2V) generative AI offer a promising path toward democratizing content creation, current models are often optimized for visual fidelity rather than instructional efficacy. This study introduces PedaCo-Gen, a pedagogically-informed human-AI collaborative video generating system for authoring instructional videos based on Mayer's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML). Moving away from traditional "one-shot" generation, PedaCo-Gen introduces an Intermediate Representation (IR) phase, enabling educators to interactively review and refine video blueprints-comprising scripts and visual descriptions-with an AI reviewer. Our study with 23 education experts demonstrates that PedaCo-Gen significantly enhances video quality across various topics and CTML principles compared to baselines. Participants perceived the AI-driven guidance not merely as a set of instructions but as a metacognitive scaffold that augmented their instructional design expertise, reporting high production efficiency (M=4.26) and guide validity (M=4.04). These findings highlight the importance of reclaiming pedagogical agency through principled co-creation, providing a foundation for future AI authoring tools that harmonize generative power with human professional expertise.</description>

      <title>Accurate Planar Tracking With Robust Re-Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SAM-H and WOFTSAM, novel planar trackers that combine robust long-term segmentation tracking provided by SAM 2 with 8 degrees-of-freedom homography pose estimation. SAM-H estimates homographies from segmentation mask contours and is thus highly robust to target appearance changes. WOFTSAM significantly improves the current state-of-the-art planar tracker WOFT by exploiting lost target re-detection provided by SAM-H. The proposed methods are evaluated on POT-210 and PlanarTrack tracking benchmarks, setting the new state-of-the-art performance on both. On the latter, they outperform the second best by a large margin, +12.4 and +15.2pp on the p@15 metric. We also present improved ground-truth annotations of initial PlanarTrack poses, enabling more accurate benchmarking in the high-precision p@5 metric. The code and the re-annotations are available at https://github.com/serycjon/WOFTSAM</description>

      <title>Localized Concept Erasure in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via High-Level Representation Misdirection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have seen rapid and widespread adoption. However, their powerful generative capabilities raise concerns about potential misuse for synthesizing harmful, private, or copyrighted content. To mitigate such risks, concept erasure techniques have emerged as a promising solution. Prior works have primarily focused on fine-tuning the denoising component (e.g., the U-Net backbone). However, recent causal tracing studies suggest that visual attribute information is localized in the early self-attention layers of the text encoder, indicating a potential alternative for concept erasing. Building on this insight, we conduct preliminary experiments and find that directly fine-tuning early layers can suppress target concepts but often degrades the generation quality of non-target concepts. To overcome this limitation, we propose High-Level Representation Misdirection (HiRM), which misdirects high-level semantic representations of target concepts in the text encoder toward designated vectors such as random directions or semantically defined directions (e.g., supercategories), while updating only early layers that contain causal states of visual attributes. Our decoupling strategy enables precise concept removal with minimal impact on unrelated concepts, as demonstrated by strong results on UnlearnCanvas and NSFW benchmarks across diverse targets (e.g., objects, styles, nudity). HiRM also preserves generative utility at low training cost, transfers to state-of-the-art architectures such as Flux without additional training, and shows synergistic effects with denoiser-based concept erasing methods.</description>

      <title>Personalized Longitudinal Medical Report Generation via Temporally-Aware Federated Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Longitudinal medical report generation is clinically important yet remains challenging due to strict privacy constraints and the evolving nature of disease progression. Although federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without data sharing, existing FL methods largely overlook longitudinal dynamics by assuming stationary client distributions, making them unable to model temporal shifts across visits or patient-specific heterogeneity-ultimately leading to unstable optimization and suboptimal report generation.
  We introduce Federated Temporal Adaptation (FTA), a federated setting that explicitly accounts for the temporal evolution of client data. Building upon this setting, we propose FedTAR, a framework that integrates demographic-driven personalization with time-aware global aggregation. FedTAR generates lightweight LoRA adapters from demographic embeddings and performs temporal residual aggregation, where updates from different visits are weighted by a meta-learned temporal policy optimized via first-order MAML.
  Experiments on J-MID (1M exams) and MIMIC-CXR demonstrate consistent improvements in linguistic accuracy, temporal coherence, and cross-site generalization, establishing FedTAR as a robust and privacy-preserving paradigm for federated longitudinal modeling.</description>

      <title>TeHOR: Text-Guided 3D Human and Object Reconstruction with Textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint reconstruction of 3D human and object from a single image is an active research area, with pivotal applications in robotics and digital content creation. Despite recent advances, existing approaches suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, their reconstructions rely heavily on physical contact information, which inherently cannot capture non-contact human-object interactions, such as gazing at or pointing toward an object. Second, the reconstruction process is primarily driven by local geometric proximity, neglecting the human and object appearances that provide global context crucial for understanding holistic interactions. To address these issues, we introduce TeHOR, a framework built upon two core designs. First, beyond contact information, our framework leverages text descriptions of human-object interactions to enforce semantic alignment between the 3D reconstruction and its textual cues, enabling reasoning over a wider spectrum of interactions, including non-contact cases. Second, we incorporate appearance cues of the 3D human and object into the alignment process to capture holistic contextual information, thereby ensuring visually plausible reconstructions. As a result, our framework produces accurate and semantically coherent reconstructions, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>BayesFusion-SDF: Probabilistic Signed Distance Fusion with View Planning on CPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Key part of robotics, augmented reality, and digital inspection is dense 3D reconstruction from depth observations. Traditional volumetric fusion techniques, including truncated signed distance functions (TSDF), enable efficient and deterministic geometry reconstruction; however, they depend on heuristic weighting and fail to transparently convey uncertainty in a systematic way. Recent neural implicit methods, on the other hand, get very high fidelity but usually need a lot of GPU power for optimization and aren't very easy to understand for making decisions later on. This work presents BayesFusion-SDF, a CPU-centric probabilistic signed distance fusion framework that conceptualizes geometry as a sparse Gaussian random field with a defined posterior distribution over voxel distances. First, a rough TSDF reconstruction is used to create an adaptive narrow-band domain. Then, depth observations are combined using a heteroscedastic Bayesian formulation that is solved using sparse linear algebra and preconditioned conjugate gradients. Randomized diagonal estimators are a quick way to get an idea of posterior uncertainty. This makes it possible to extract surfaces and plan the next best view while taking into account uncertainty. Tests on a controlled ablation scene and a CO3D object sequence show that the new method is more accurate geometrically than TSDF baselines and gives useful estimates of uncertainty for active sensing. The proposed formulation provides a clear and easy-to-use alternative to GPU-heavy neural reconstruction methods while still being able to be understood in a probabilistic way and acting in a predictable way.

      <title>HDR Reconstruction Boosting with Training-Free and Exposure-Consistent Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single LDR to HDR reconstruction remains challenging for over-exposed regions where traditional methods often fail due to complete information loss. We present a training-free approach that enhances existing indirect and direct HDR reconstruction methods through diffusion-based inpainting. Our method combines text-guided diffusion models with SDEdit refinement to generate plausible content in over-exposed areas while maintaining consistency across multi-exposure LDR images. Unlike previous approaches requiring extensive training, our method seamlessly integrates with existing HDR reconstruction techniques through an iterative compensation mechanism that ensures luminance coherence across multiple exposures. We demonstrate significant improvements in both perceptual quality and quantitative metrics on standard HDR datasets and in-the-wild captures. Results show that our method effectively recovers natural details in challenging scenarios while preserving the advantages of existing HDR reconstruction pipelines.

      <title>ChimeraLoRA: Multi-Head LoRA-Guided Synthetic Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond general recognition tasks, specialized domains including privacy-constrained medical applications and fine-grained settings often encounter data scarcity, especially for tail classes. To obtain less biased and more reliable models under such scarcity, practitioners leverage diffusion models to supplement underrepresented regions of real data. Specifically, recent studies fine-tune pretrained diffusion models with LoRA on few-shot real sets to synthesize additional images. While an image-wise LoRA trained on a single image captures fine-grained details yet offers limited diversity, a class-wise LoRA trained over all shots produces diverse images as it encodes class priors yet tends to overlook fine details. To combine both benefits, we separate the adapter into a class-shared LoRA~$A$ for class priors and per-image LoRAs~$\mathcal{B}$ for image-specific characteristics. To expose coherent class semantics in the shared LoRA~$A$, we propose a semantic boosting by preserving class bounding boxes during training. For generation, we compose $A$ with a mixture of $\mathcal{B}$ using coefficients drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. Across diverse datasets, our synthesized images are both diverse and detail-rich while closely aligning with the few-shot real distribution, yielding robust gains in downstream classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>Universal Pose Pretraining for Generalizable Vision-Language-Action Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often suffer from feature collapse and low training efficiency because they entangle high-level perception with sparse, embodiment-specific action supervision. Since these models typically rely on VLM backbones optimized for Visual Question Answering (VQA), they excel at semantic identification but often overlook subtle 3D state variations that dictate distinct action patterns.
  To resolve these misalignments, we propose Pose-VLA, a decoupled paradigm that separates VLA training into a pre-training phase for extracting universal 3D spatial priors in a unified camera-centric space, and a post-training phase for efficient embodiment alignment within robot-specific action space. By introducing discrete pose tokens as a universal representation, Pose-VLA seamlessly integrates spatial grounding from diverse 3D datasets with geometry-level trajectories from robotic demonstrations. Our framework follows a two-stage pre-training pipeline, establishing fundamental spatial grounding via poses followed by motion alignment through trajectory supervision.
  Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Pose-VLA achieves state-of-the-art results on RoboTwin 2.0 with a 79.5% average success rate and competitive performance on LIBERO at 96.0%. Real-world experiments further showcase robust generalization across diverse objects using only 100 demonstrations per task, validating the efficiency of our pre-training paradigm.</description>

      <title>Pixels Don't Lie (But Your Detector Might): Bootstrapping MLLM-as-a-Judge for Trustworthy Deepfake Detection and Reasoning Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deepfake detection models often generate natural-language explanations, yet their reasoning is frequently ungrounded in visual evidence, limiting reliability. Existing evaluations measure classification accuracy but overlook reasoning fidelity. We propose DeepfakeJudge, a framework for scalable reasoning supervision and evaluation, that integrates an out-of-distribution benchmark containing recent generative and editing forgeries, a human-annotated subset with visual reasoning labels, and a suite of evaluation models, that specialize in evaluating reasoning rationales without the need for explicit ground truth reasoning rationales. The Judge is optimized through a bootstrapped generator-evaluator process that scales human feedback into structured reasoning supervision and supports both pointwise and pairwise evaluation. On the proposed meta-evaluation benchmark, our reasoning-bootstrapped model achieves an accuracy of 96.2\%, outperforming \texttt{30x} larger baselines. The reasoning judge attains very high correlation with human ratings and 98.9\% percent pairwise agreement on the human-annotated meta-evaluation subset. These results establish reasoning fidelity as a quantifiable dimension of deepfake detection and demonstrate scalable supervision for interpretable deepfake reasoning. Our user study shows that participants preferred the reasonings generated by our framework 70\% of the time, in terms of faithfulness, groundedness, and usefulness, compared to those produced by other models and datasets. All of our datasets, models, and codebase are \href{https://github.com/KjAeRsTuIsK/DeepfakeJudge}{open-sourced}.</description>

      <title>Generative 6D Pose Estimation via Conditional Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing methods for instance-level 6D pose estimation typically rely on neural networks that either directly regress the pose in $\mathrm{SE}(3)$ or estimate it indirectly via local feature matching. The former struggle with object symmetries, while the latter fail in the absence of distinctive local features. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel formulation of 6D pose estimation as a conditional flow matching problem in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We introduce Flose, a generative method that infers object poses via a denoising process conditioned on local features. While prior approaches based on conditional flow matching perform denoising solely based on geometric guidance, Flose integrates appearance-based semantic features to mitigate ambiguities caused by object symmetries. We further incorporate RANSAC-based registration to handle outliers. We validate Flose on five datasets from the established BOP benchmark. Flose outperforms prior methods with an average improvement of +4.5 Average Recall. Project Website : https://tev-fbk.github.io/Flose/</description>

      <title>Towards Personalized Multi-Modal MRI Synthesis across Heterogeneous Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthesizing missing modalities in multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is vital for ensuring diagnostic completeness, particularly when full acquisitions are infeasible due to time constraints, motion artifacts, and patient tolerance. Recent unified synthesis models have enabled flexible synthesis tasks by accommodating various input-output configurations. However, their training and evaluation are typically restricted to a single dataset, limiting their generalizability across diverse clinical datasets and impeding practical deployment. To address this limitation, we propose PMM-Synth, a personalized MRI synthesis framework that not only supports various synthesis tasks but also generalizes effectively across heterogeneous datasets. PMM-Synth is jointly trained on multiple multi-modal MRI datasets that differ in modality coverage, disease types, and intensity distributions. It achieves cross-dataset generalization through three core innovations: a Personalized Feature Modulation module that dynamically adapts feature representations based on dataset identifier to mitigate the impact of distributional shifts; a Modality-Consistent Batch Scheduler that facilitates stable and efficient batch training under inconsistent modality conditions; and a selective supervision loss to ensure effective learning when ground truth modalities are partially missing. Evaluated on four clinical multi-modal MRI datasets, PMM-Synth consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both one-to-one and many-to-one synthesis tasks, achieving superior PSNR and SSIM scores. Qualitative results further demonstrate improved preservation of anatomical structures and pathological details. Additionally, downstream tumor segmentation and radiological reporting studies suggest that PMM-Synth holds potential for supporting reliable diagnosis under real-world modality-missing scenarios.</description>

      <title>VGGT-MPR: VGGT-Enhanced Multimodal Place Recognition in Autonomous Driving Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In autonomous driving, robust place recognition is critical for global localization and loop closure detection. While inter-modality fusion of camera and LiDAR data in multimodal place recognition (MPR) has shown promise in overcoming the limitations of unimodal counterparts, existing MPR methods basically attend to hand-crafted fusion strategies and heavily parameterized backbones that require costly retraining. To address this, we propose VGGT-MPR, a multimodal place recognition framework that adopts the Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) as a unified geometric engine for both global retrieval and re-ranking. In the global retrieval stage, VGGT extracts geometrically-rich visual embeddings through prior depth-aware and point map supervision, and densifies sparse LiDAR point clouds with predicted depth maps to improve structural representation. This enhances the discriminative ability of fused multimodal features and produces global descriptors for fast retrieval. Beyond global retrieval, we design a training-free re-ranking mechanism that exploits VGGT's cross-view keypoint-tracking capability. By combining mask-guided keypoint extraction with confidence-aware correspondence scoring, our proposed re-ranking mechanism effectively refines retrieval results without additional parameter optimization. Extensive experiments on large-scale autonomous driving benchmarks and our self-collected data demonstrate that VGGT-MPR achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong robustness to severe environmental changes, viewpoint shifts, and occlusions. Our code and data will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>InfScene-SR: Spatially Continuous Inference for Arbitrary-Size Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to recover high-resolution (HR) details from low-resolution (LR) inputs, a task where Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have recently shown superior performance compared to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based approaches. However, standard diffusion-based SR models, such as SR3, are typically trained on fixed-size patches and struggle to scale to arbitrary-sized images due to memory constraints. Applying these models via independent patch processing leads to visible seams and inconsistent textures across boundaries. In this paper, we propose InfScene-SR, a framework enabling spatially continuous super-resolution for large, arbitrary scenes. We adapt the iterative refinement process of diffusion models with a novel guided and variance-corrected fusion mechanism, allowing for the seamless generation of large-scale high-resolution imagery without retraining. We validate our approach on remote sensing datasets, demonstrating that InfScene-SR not only reconstructs fine details with high perceptual quality but also eliminates boundary artifacts, benefiting downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation.</description>

      <title>RAP: Fast Feedforward Rendering-Free Attribute-Guided Primitive Importance Score Prediction for Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a leading technology for high-quality 3D scene reconstruction. However, the iterative refinement and densification process leads to the generation of a large number of primitives, each contributing to the reconstruction to a substantially different extent. Estimating primitive importance is thus crucial, both for removing redundancy during reconstruction and for enabling efficient compression and transmission. Existing methods typically rely on rendering-based analyses, where each primitive is evaluated through its contribution across multiple camera viewpoints. However, such methods are sensitive to the number and selection of views, rely on specialized differentiable rasterizers, and have long calculation times that grow linearly with view count, making them difficult to integrate as plug-and-play modules and limiting scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose RAP, a fast feedforward rendering-free attribute-guided method for efficient importance score prediction in 3DGS. RAP infers primitive significance directly from intrinsic Gaussian attributes and local neighborhood statistics, avoiding rendering-based or visibility-dependent computations. A compact MLP predicts per-primitive importance scores using rendering loss, pruning-aware loss, and significance distribution regularization. After training on a small set of scenes, RAP generalizes effectively to unseen data and can be seamlessly integrated into reconstruction, compression, and transmission pipelines. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/yyyykf/RAP.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Dataset Distillation Made Simple by Prototype-Guided Data Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal learning have achieved remarkable success across diverse vision-language tasks. However, such progress heavily relies on large-scale image-text datasets, making training costly and inefficient. Prior efforts in dataset filtering and pruning attempt to mitigate this issue, but still require relatively large subsets to maintain performance and fail under very small subsets. Dataset distillation offers a promising alternative, yet existing multimodal dataset distillation methods require full-dataset training and joint optimization of image pixels and text features, making them architecture-dependent and limiting cross-architecture generalization. To overcome this, we propose a learning-free dataset distillation framework that eliminates the need for large-scale training and optimization while enhancing generalization across architectures. Our method uses CLIP to extract aligned image-text embeddings, obtains prototypes, and employs an unCLIP decoder to synthesize images, enabling efficient and scalable multimodal dataset distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms optimization-based dataset distillation and subset selection methods, achieving state-of-the-art cross-architecture generalization.</description>

      <title>Training Deep Stereo Matching Networks on Tree Branch Imagery: A Benchmark Study for Real-Time UAV Forestry Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous drone-based tree pruning needs accurate, real-time depth estimation from stereo cameras. Depth is computed from disparity maps using $Z = f B/d$, so even small disparity errors cause noticeable depth mistakes at working distances. Building on our earlier work that identified DEFOM-Stereo as the best reference disparity generator for vegetation scenes, we present the first study to train and test ten deep stereo matching networks on real tree branch images. We use the Canterbury Tree Branches dataset -- 5,313 stereo pairs from a ZED Mini camera at 1080P and 720P -- with DEFOM-generated disparity maps as training targets. The ten methods cover step-by-step refinement, 3D convolution, edge-aware attention, and lightweight designs. Using perceptual metrics (SSIM, LPIPS, ViTScore) and structural metrics (SIFT/ORB feature matching), we find that BANet-3D produces the best overall quality (SSIM = 0.883, LPIPS = 0.157), while RAFT-Stereo scores highest on scene-level understanding (ViTScore = 0.799). Testing on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Super (16 GB, independently powered) mounted on our drone shows that AnyNet reaches 6.99 FPS at 1080P -- the only near-real-time option -- while BANet-2D gives the best quality-speed balance at 1.21 FPS. We also compare 720P and 1080P processing times to guide resolution choices for forestry drone systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating explorable 3D scenes from a single image is a highly challenging problem in 3D vision. Existing methods struggle to support free exploration, often producing severe geometric distortions and noisy artifacts when the viewpoint moves far from the original perspective. We introduce \textbf{One2Scene}, an effective framework that decomposes this ill-posed problem into three tractable sub-tasks to enable immersive explorable scene generation. We first use a panorama generator to produce anchor views from a single input image as initialization. Then, we lift these 2D anchors into an explicit 3D geometric scaffold via a generalizable, feed-forward Gaussian Splatting network. Instead of treating the panorama as a single image for reconstruction, we project it into multiple sparse anchor views and reformulate the reconstruction task as multi-view stereo matching, which allows us to leverage robust geometric priors learned from large-scale multi-view datasets. A bidirectional feature fusion module is used to enforce cross-view consistency, yielding an efficient and geometrically reliable scaffold. Finally, the scaffold serves as a strong prior for a novel view generator to produce photorealistic and geometrically accurate views at arbitrary cameras. By explicitly conditioning on a 3D-consistent scaffold to perform reconstruction, One2Scene works stably under large camera motions, supporting immersive scene exploration. Extensive experiments show that One2Scene substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in panorama depth estimation, feed-forward 360{\deg} reconstruction, and explorable 3D scene generation. Code and models will be released.</description>

      <title>TraceVision: Trajectory-Aware Vision-Language Model for Human-Like Spatial Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in image understanding and natural language generation. However, current approaches focus predominantly on global image understanding, struggling to simulate human visual attention trajectories and explain associations between descriptions and specific regions. We propose TraceVision, a unified vision-language model integrating trajectory-aware spatial understanding in an end-to-end framework. TraceVision employs a Trajectory-aware Visual Perception (TVP) module for bidirectional fusion of visual features and trajectory information. We design geometric simplification to extract semantic keypoints from raw trajectories and propose a three-stage training pipeline where trajectories guide description generation and region localization. We extend TraceVision to trajectory-guided segmentation and video scene understanding, enabling cross-frame tracking and temporal attention analysis. We construct the Reasoning-based Interactive Localized Narratives (RILN) dataset to enhance logical reasoning and interpretability. Extensive experiments on trajectory-guided captioning, text-guided trajectory prediction, understanding, and segmentation demonstrate that TraceVision achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing a foundation for intuitive spatial interaction and interpretable visual understanding.</description>

      <title>Efficient endometrial carcinoma screening via cross-modal synthesis and gradient distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection of myometrial invasion is critical for the staging and life-saving management of endometrial carcinoma (EC), a prevalent global malignancy. Transvaginal ultrasound serves as the primary, accessible screening modality in resource-constrained primary care settings; however, its diagnostic reliability is severely hindered by low tissue contrast, high operator dependence, and a pronounced scarcity of positive pathological samples. Existing artificial intelligence solutions struggle to overcome this severe class imbalance and the subtle imaging features of invasion, particularly under the strict computational limits of primary care clinics. Here we present an automated, highly efficient two-stage deep learning framework that resolves both data and computational bottlenecks in EC screening. To mitigate pathological data scarcity, we develop a structure-guided cross-modal generation network that synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity ultrasound images from unpaired magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, strictly preserving clinically essential anatomical junctions. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight screening network utilizing gradient distillation, which transfers discriminative knowledge from a high-capacity teacher model to dynamically guide sparse attention towards task-critical regions. Evaluated on a large, multicenter cohort of 7,951 participants, our model achieves a sensitivity of 99.5\%, a specificity of 97.2\%, and an area under the curve of 0.987 at a minimal computational cost (0.289 GFLOPs), substantially outperforming the average diagnostic accuracy of expert sonographers. Our approach demonstrates that combining cross-modal synthetic augmentation with knowledge-driven efficient modeling can democratize expert-level, real-time cancer screening for resource-constrained primary care settings.</description>

      <title>Open-vocabulary 3D scene perception in industrial environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vision applications in production, intralogistics, or manufacturing environments require perception capabilities beyond a small, fixed set of classes. Recent open-vocabulary methods, leveraging 2D Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLFMs), target this task but often rely on class-agnostic segmentation models pre-trained on non-industrial datasets (e.g., household scenes). In this work, we first demonstrate that such models fail to generalize, performing poorly on common industrial objects. Therefore, we propose a training-free, open-vocabulary 3D perception pipeline that overcomes this limitation. Instead of using a pre-trained model to generate instance proposals, our method simply generates masks by merging pre-computed superpoints based on their semantic features. Following, we evaluate the domain-adapted VLFM "IndustrialCLIP" on a representative 3D industrial workshop scene for open-vocabulary querying. Our qualitative results demonstrate successful segmentation of industrial objects.</description>

      <title>TextShield-R1: Reinforced Reasoning for Tampered Text Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing prevalence of tampered images poses serious security threats, highlighting the urgent need for reliable detection methods. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong potential in analyzing tampered images and generating interpretations. However, they still struggle with identifying micro-level artifacts, exhibit low accuracy in localizing tampered text regions, and heavily rely on expensive annotations for forgery interpretation. To this end, we introduce TextShield-R1, the first reinforcement learning based MLLM solution for tampered text detection and reasoning. Specifically, our approach introduces Forensic Continual Pre-training, an easy-to-hard curriculum that well prepares the MLLM for tampered text detection by harnessing the large-scale cheap data from natural image forensic and OCR tasks. During fine-tuning, we perform Group Relative Policy Optimization with novel reward functions to reduce annotation dependency and improve reasoning capabilities. At inference time, we enhance localization accuracy via OCR Rectification, a method that leverages the MLLM's strong text recognition abilities to refine its predictions. Furthermore, to support rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Text Forensics Reasoning (TFR) benchmark, comprising over 45k real and tampered images across 16 languages, 10 tampering techniques, and diverse domains. Rich reasoning-style annotations are included, allowing for comprehensive assessment. Our TFR benchmark simultaneously addresses seven major limitations of existing benchmarks and enables robust evaluation under cross-style, cross-method, and cross-language conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TextShield-R1 significantly advances the state of the art in interpretable tampered text detection.</description>

      <title>M3S-Net: Multimodal Feature Fusion Network Based on Multi-scale Data for Ultra-short-term PV Power Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherent intermittency and high-frequency variability of solar irradiance, particularly during rapid cloud advection, present significant stability challenges to high-penetration photovoltaic grids. Although multimodal forecasting has emerged as a viable mitigation strategy, existing architectures predominantly rely on shallow feature concatenation and binary cloud segmentation, thereby failing to capture the fine-grained optical features of clouds and the complex spatiotemporal coupling between visual and meteorological modalities. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes M3S-Net, a novel multimodal feature fusion network based on multi-scale data for ultra-short-term PV power forecasting. First, a multi-scale partial channel selection network leverages partial convolutions to explicitly isolate the boundary features of optically thin clouds, effectively transcending the precision limitations of coarse-grained binary masking. Second, a multi-scale sequence to image analysis network employs Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based time-frequency representation to disentangle the complex periodicity of meteorological data across varying time horizons. Crucially, the model incorporates a cross-modal Mamba interaction module featuring a novel dynamic C-matrix swapping mechanism. By exchanging state-space parameters between visual and temporal streams, this design conditions the state evolution of one modality on the context of the other, enabling deep structural coupling with linear computational complexity, thus overcoming the limitations of shallow concatenation. Experimental validation on the newly constructed fine-grained PV power dataset demonstrates that M3S-Net achieves a mean absolute error reduction of 6.2% in 10-minute forecasts compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

      <title>DerMAE: Improving skin lesion classification through conditioned latent diffusion and MAE distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skin lesion classification datasets often suffer from severe class imbalance, with malignant cases significantly underrepresented, leading to biased decision boundaries during deep learning training. We address this challenge using class-conditioned diffusion models to generate synthetic dermatological images, followed by self-supervised MAE pretraining to enable huge ViT models to learn robust, domain-relevant features. To support deployment in practical clinical settings, where lightweight models are required, we apply knowledge distillation to transfer these representations to a smaller ViT student suitable for mobile devices. Our results show that MAE pretraining on synthetic data, combined with distillation, improves classification performance while enabling efficient on-device inference for practical clinical use.</description>

      <title>Contrastive meta-domain adaptation for robust skin lesion classification across clinical and acquisition conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models for dermatological image analysis remain sensitive to acquisition variability and domain-specific visual characteristics, leading to performance degradation when deployed in clinical settings. We investigate how visual artifacts and domain shifts affect deep learning-based skin lesion classification. We propose an adaptation strategy, grounded in the idea of visual meta-domains, that transfers visual representations from larger dermoscopic datasets into clinical image domains, thereby improving generalization robustness. Experiments across multiple dermatology datasets show consistent gains in classification performance and reduced gaps between dermoscopic and clinical images. These results emphasize the importance of domain-aware training for deployable systems.</description>

      <title>Brewing Stronger Features: Dual-Teacher Distillation for Multispectral Earth Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models are transforming Earth Observation (EO), yet the diversity of EO sensors and modalities makes a single universal model unrealistic. Multiple specialized EO foundation models (EOFMs) will likely coexist, making efficient knowledge transfer across modalities essential. Most existing EO pretraining relies on masked image modeling, which emphasizes local reconstruction but provides limited control over global semantic structure. To address this, we propose a dual-teacher contrastive distillation framework for multispectral imagery that aligns the student's pretraining objective with the contrastive self-distillation paradigm of modern optical vision foundation models (VFMs). Our approach combines a multispectral teacher with an optical VFM teacher, enabling coherent cross-modal representation learning. Experiments across diverse optical and multispectral benchmarks show that our model adapts to multispectral data without compromising performance on optical-only inputs, achieving state-of-the-art results in both settings, with an average improvement of 3.64 percentage points in semantic segmentation, 1.2 in change detection, and 1.31 in classification tasks. This demonstrates that contrastive distillation provides a principled and efficient approach to scalable representation learning across heterogeneous EO data sources. Code: Coming soon.</description>

      <title>ApET: Approximation-Error Guided Token Compression for Efficient VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal understanding capabilities, yet the redundant visual tokens incur prohibitive computational overhead and degrade inference efficiency. Prior studies typically relies on [CLS] attention or text-vision cross-attention to identify and discard redundant visual tokens. Despite promising results, such solutions are prone to introduce positional bias and, more critically, are incompatible with efficient attention kernels such as FlashAttention, limiting their practical deployment for VLM acceleration. In this paper, we step away from attention dependencies and revisit visual token compression from an information-theoretic perspective, aiming to maximally preserve visual information without any attention involvement. We present ApET, an Approximation-Error guided Token compression framework. ApET first reconstructs the original visual tokens with a small set of basis tokens via linear approximation, then leverages the approximation error to identify and drop the least informative tokens. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that ApET retains 95.2% of the original performance on image-understanding tasks and even attains 100.4% on video-understanding tasks, while compressing the token budgets by 88.9% and 87.5%, respectively. Thanks to its attention-free design, ApET seamlessly integrates with FlashAttention, enabling further inference acceleration and making VLM deployment more practical.

      <title>GOAL: Geometrically Optimal Alignment for Continual Generalized Category Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD) requires identifying novel classes from unlabeled data while retaining knowledge of known classes over time. Existing methods typically update classifier weights dynamically, resulting in forgetting and inconsistent feature alignment. We propose GOAL, a unified framework that introduces a fixed Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) classifier to impose a consistent geometric structure throughout learning. GOAL conducts supervised alignment for labeled samples and confidence-guided alignment for novel samples, enabling stable integration of new classes without disrupting old ones. Experiments on four benchmarks show that GOAL outperforms the prior method Happy, reducing forgetting by 16.1% and boosting novel class discovery by 3.2%, establishing a strong solution for long-horizon continual discovery.</description>

      <title>BigMaQ: A Big Macaque Motion and Animation Dataset Bridging Image and 3D Pose Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recognition of dynamic and social behavior in animals is fundamental for advancing ethology, ecology, medicine and neuroscience. Recent progress in deep learning has enabled automated behavior recognition from video, yet an accurate reconstruction of the three-dimensional (3D) pose and shape has not been integrated into this process. Especially for non-human primates, mesh-based tracking efforts lag behind those for other species, leaving pose descriptions restricted to sparse keypoints that are unable to fully capture the richness of action dynamics. To address this gap, we introduce the $\textbf{Big Ma}$ca$\textbf{Q}$ue 3D Motion and Animation Dataset ($\texttt{BigMaQ}$), a large-scale dataset comprising more than 750 scenes of interacting rhesus macaques with detailed 3D pose descriptions. Extending previous surface-based animal tracking methods, we construct subject-specific textured avatars by adapting a high-quality macaque template mesh to individual monkeys. This allows us to provide pose descriptions that are more accurate than previous state-of-the-art surface-based animal tracking methods. From the original dataset, we derive BigMaQ500, an action recognition benchmark that links surface-based pose vectors to single frames across multiple individual monkeys. By pairing features extracted from established image and video encoders with and without our pose descriptors, we demonstrate substantial improvements in mean average precision (mAP) when pose information is included. With these contributions, $\texttt{BigMaQ}$ establishes the first dataset that both integrates dynamic 3D pose-shape representations into the learning task of animal action recognition and provides a rich resource to advance the study of visual appearance, posture, and social interaction in non-human primates. The code and data are publicly available at https://martinivis.github.io/BigMaQ/ .</description>

      <title>Make Some Noise: Unsupervised Remote Sensing Change Detection Using Latent Space Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised change detection (UCD) in remote sensing aims to localise semantic changes between two images of the same region without relying on labelled data during training. Most recent approaches rely either on frozen foundation models in a training-free manner or on training with synthetic changes generated in pixel space. Both strategies inherently rely on predefined assumptions about change types, typically introduced through handcrafted rules, external datasets, or auxiliary generative models. Due to these assumptions, such methods fail to generalise beyond a few change types, limiting their real-world usage, especially in rare or complex scenarios. To address this, we propose MaSoN (Make Some Noise), an end-to-end UCD framework that synthesises diverse changes directly in the latent feature space during training. It generates changes that are dynamically estimated using feature statistics of target data, enabling diverse yet data-driven variation aligned with the target domain. It also easily extends to new modalities, such as SAR. MaSoN generalises strongly across diverse change types and achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks, improving the average F1 score by 14.1 percentage points.

      <title>Monocular Mesh Recovery and Body Measurement of Female Saanen Goats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lactation performance of Saanen dairy goats, renowned for their high milk yield, is intrinsically linked to their body size, making accurate 3D body measurement essential for assessing milk production potential, yet existing reconstruction methods lack goat-specific authentic 3D data. To address this limitation, we establish the FemaleSaanenGoat dataset containing synchronized eight-view RGBD videos of 55 female Saanen goats (6-18 months). Using multi-view DynamicFusion, we fuse noisy, non-rigid point cloud sequences into high-fidelity 3D scans, overcoming challenges from irregular surfaces and rapid movement. Based on these scans, we develop SaanenGoat, a parametric 3D shape model specifically designed for female Saanen goats. This model features a refined template with 41 skeletal joints and enhanced udder representation, registered with our scan data. A comprehensive shape space constructed from 48 goats enables precise representation of diverse individual variations. With the help of SaanenGoat model, we get high-precision 3D reconstruction from single-view RGBD input, and achieve automated measurement of six critical body dimensions: body length, height, chest width, chest girth, hip width, and hip height. Experimental results demonstrate the superior accuracy of our method in both 3D reconstruction and body measurement, presenting a novel paradigm for large-scale 3D vision applications in precision livestock farming.</description>

Abstract: While diffusion models have shown great potential in portrait generation, generating expressive, coherent, and controllable cinematic portrait videos remains a significant challenge. Existing intermediate signals for portrait generation, such as 2D landmarks and parametric models, have limited disentanglement capabilities and cannot express personalized details due to their sparse or low-rank representation. Therefore, existing methods based on these models struggle to accurately preserve subject identity and expressions, hindering the generation of highly expressive portrait videos. To overcome these limitations, we propose a high-fidelity personalized head representation that more effectively disentangles expression and identity. This representation captures both static, subject-specific global geometry and dynamic, expression-related details. Furthermore, we introduce an expression transfer module to achieve personalized transfer of head pose and expression details between different identities. We use this sophisticated and highly expressive head model as a conditional signal to train a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based generator to synthesize richly detailed portrait videos. Extensive experiments on self- and cross-reenactment tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous models in terms of identity preservation, expression accuracy, and temporal stability, particularly in capturing fine-grained details of complex motion.</description>

      <title>Gradient based Severity Labeling for Biomarker Classification in OCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel selection strategy for contrastive learning for medical images. On natural images, contrastive learning uses augmentations to select positive and negative pairs for the contrastive loss. However, in the medical domain, arbitrary augmentations have the potential to distort small localized regions that contain the biomarkers we are interested in detecting. A more intuitive approach is to select samples with similar disease severity characteristics, since these samples are more likely to have similar structures related to the progression of a disease. To enable this, we introduce a method that generates disease severity labels for unlabeled OCT scans on the basis of gradient responses from an anomaly detection algorithm. These labels are used to train a supervised contrastive learning setup to improve biomarker classification accuracy by as much as 6% above self-supervised baselines for key indicators of Diabetic Retinopathy.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Representation Learning via Semi-Supervised Rate Reduction for Generalized Category Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify both known and unknown categories, with only partial labels given for the known categories, posing a challenging open-set recognition problem. State-of-the-art approaches for GCD task are usually built on multi-modality representation learning, which is heavily dependent upon inter-modality alignment. However, few of them cast a proper intra-modality alignment to generate a desired underlying structure of representation distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective multi-modal representation learning framework for GCD via Semi-Supervised Rate Reduction, called SSR$^2$-GCD, to learn cross-modality representations with desired structural properties based on emphasizing to properly align intra-modality relationships. Moreover, to boost knowledge transfer, we integrate prompt candidates by leveraging the inter-modal alignment offered by Vision Language Models. We conduct extensive experiments on generic and fine-grained benchmark datasets demonstrating superior performance of our approach.</description>

      <title>Augmented Radiance Field: A General Framework for Enhanced Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the real-time rendering performance, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as the leading method for radiance field reconstruction. However, its reliance on spherical harmonics for color encoding inherently limits its ability to separate diffuse and specular components, making it challenging to accurately represent complex reflections. To address this, we propose a novel enhanced Gaussian kernel that explicitly models specular effects through view-dependent opacity. Meanwhile, we introduce an error-driven compensation strategy to improve rendering quality in existing 3DGS scenes. Our method begins with 2D Gaussian initialization and then adaptively inserts and optimizes enhanced Gaussian kernels, ultimately producing an augmented radiance field. Experiments demonstrate that our method not only surpasses state-of-the-art NeRF methods in rendering performance but also achieves greater parameter efficiency.

      <title>Learning Positive-Incentive Point Sampling in Neural Implicit Fields for Object Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning neural implicit fields of 3D shapes is a rapidly emerging field that enables shape representation at arbitrary resolutions. Due to the flexibility, neural implicit fields have succeeded in many research areas, including shape reconstruction, novel view image synthesis, and more recently, object pose estimation. Neural implicit fields enable learning dense correspondences between the camera space and the object's canonical space-including unobserved regions in camera space-significantly boosting object pose estimation performance in challenging scenarios like highly occluded objects and novel shapes. Despite progress, predicting canonical coordinates for unobserved camera-space regions remains challenging due to the lack of direct observational signals. This necessitates heavy reliance on the model's generalization ability, resulting in high uncertainty. Consequently, densely sampling points across the entire camera space may yield inaccurate estimations that hinder the learning process and compromise performance. To alleviate this problem, we propose a method combining an SO(3)-equivariant convolutional implicit network and a positive-incentive point sampling (PIPS) strategy. The SO(3)-equivariant convolutional implicit network estimates point-level attributes with SO(3)-equivariance at arbitrary query locations, demonstrating superior performance compared to most existing baselines. The PIPS strategy dynamically determines sampling locations based on the input, thereby boosting the network's accuracy and training efficiency. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on three pose estimation datasets. Notably, it demonstrates significant improvements in challenging scenarios, such as objects captured with unseen pose, high occlusion, novel geometry, and severe noise.</description>

      <title>Discover, Segment, and Select: A Progressive Mechanism for Zero-shot Camouflaged Object Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current zero-shot Camouflaged Object Segmentation methods typically employ a two-stage pipeline (discover-then-segment): using MLLMs to obtain visual prompts, followed by SAM segmentation. However, relying solely on MLLMs for camouflaged object discovery often leads to inaccurate localization, false positives, and missed detections. To address these issues, we propose the \textbf{D}iscover-\textbf{S}egment-\textbf{S}elect (\textbf{DSS}) mechanism, a progressive framework designed to refine segmentation step by step. The proposed method contains a Feature-coherent Object Discovery (FOD) module that leverages visual features to generate diverse object proposals, a segmentation module that refines these proposals through SAM segmentation, and a Semantic-driven Mask Selection (SMS) module that employs MLLMs to evaluate and select the optimal segmentation mask from multiple candidates. Without requiring any training or supervision, DSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple COS benchmarks, especially in multiple-instance scenes.</description>

      <title>When Pretty Isn't Useful: Investigating Why Modern Text-to-Image Models Fail as Reliable Training Data Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models produce visually stunning images and demonstrate excellent prompt following. But do they perform well as synthetic vision data generators? In this work, we revisit the promise of synthetic data as a scalable substitute for real training sets and uncover a surprising performance regression. We generate large-scale synthetic datasets using state-of-the-art T2I models released between 2022 and 2025, train standard classifiers solely on this synthetic data, and evaluate them on real test data. Despite observable advances in visual fidelity and prompt adherence, classification accuracy on real test data consistently declines with newer T2I models as training data generators. Our analysis reveals a hidden trend: These models collapse to a narrow, aesthetic-centric distribution that undermines diversity and label-image alignment. Overall, our findings challenge a growing assumption in vision research, namely that progress in generative realism implies progress in data realism. We thus highlight an urgent need to rethink the capabilities of modern T2I models as reliable training data generators.</description>

      <title>RL-RIG: A Generative Spatial Reasoner via Intrinsic Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image generation have achieved impressive results in producing high-quality images. However, existing image generation models still generally struggle with a spatial reasoning dilemma, lacking the ability to accurately capture fine-grained spatial relationships from the prompt and correctly generate scenes with structural integrity. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose RL-RIG, a Reinforcement Learning framework for Reflection-based Image Generation. Our architecture comprises four primary components: Diffuser, Checker, Actor, and Inverse Diffuser, following a Generate-Reflect-Edit paradigm to spark the Chain of Thought reasoning ability in image generation for addressing the dilemma. To equip the model with better intuition over generation trajectories, we further develop Reflection-GRPO to train the VLM Actor for edit prompts and the Image Editor for better image quality under a given prompt, respectively. Unlike traditional approaches that solely produce visually stunning yet structurally unreasonable content, our evaluation metrics prioritize spatial accuracy, utilizing Scene Graph IoU and employing a VLM-as-a-Judge strategy to assess the spatial consistency of generated images on LAION-SG dataset. Experimental results show that RL-RIG outperforms existing state-of-the-art open-source models by up to 11% in terms of controllable and precise spatial reasoning in image generation.</description>

      <title>RADE-Net: Robust Attention Network for Radar-Only Object Detection in Adverse Weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automotive perception systems are obligated to meet high requirements. While optical sensors such as Camera and Lidar struggle in adverse weather conditions, Radar provides a more robust perception performance, effectively penetrating fog, rain, and snow. Since full Radar tensors have large data sizes and very few datasets provide them, most Radar-based approaches work with sparse point clouds or 2D projections, which can result in information loss. Additionally, deep learning methods show potential to extract richer and more dense features from low level Radar data and therefore significantly increase the perception performance. Therefore, we propose a 3D projection method for fast-Fourier-transformed 4D Range-Azimuth-Doppler-Elevation (RADE) tensors. Our method preserves rich Doppler and Elevation features while reducing the required data size for a single frame by 91.9% compared to a full tensor, thus achieving higher training and inference speed as well as lower model complexity. We introduce RADE-Net, a lightweight model tailored to 3D projections of the RADE tensor. The backbone enables exploitation of low-level and high-level cues of Radar tensors with spatial and channel-attention. The decoupled detection heads predict object center-points directly in the Range-Azimuth domain and regress rotated 3D bounding boxes from rich feature maps in the cartesian scene. We evaluate the model on scenes with multiple different road users and under various weather conditions on the large-scale K-Radar dataset and achieve a 16.7% improvement compared to their baseline, as well as 6.5% improvement over current Radar-only models. Additionally, we outperform several Lidar approaches in scenarios with adverse weather conditions. The code is available under https://github.com/chr-is-tof/RADE-Net.</description>

      <title>Token-UNet: A New Case for Transformers Integration in Efficient and Interpretable 3D UNets for Brain Imaging Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Token-UNet, adopting the TokenLearner and TokenFuser modules to encase Transformers into UNets.
  While Transformers have enabled global interactions among input elements in medical imaging, current computational challenges hinder their deployment on common hardware. Models like (Swin)UNETR adapt the UNet architecture by incorporating (Swin)Transformer encoders, which process tokens that each represent small subvolumes ($8^3$ voxels) of the input.
  The Transformer attention mechanism scales quadratically with the number of tokens, which is tied to the cubic scaling of 3D input resolution.
  This work reconsiders the role of convolution and attention, introducing Token-UNets, a family of 3D segmentation models that can operate in constrained computational environments and time frames.
  To mitigate computational demands, our approach maintains the convolutional encoder of UNet-like models, and applies TokenLearner to 3D feature maps. This module pools a preset number of tokens from local and global structures.
  Our results show this tokenization effectively encodes task-relevant information, yielding naturally interpretable attention maps. The memory footprint, computation times at inference, and parameter counts of our heaviest model are reduced to 33\%, 10\%, and 35\% of the SwinUNETR values, with better average performance (86.75\% $\pm 0.19\%$ Dice score for SwinUNETR vs our 87.21\% $\pm 0.35\%$).
  This work opens the way to more efficient trainings in contexts with limited computational resources, such as 3D medical imaging. Easing model optimization, fine-tuning, and transfer-learning in limited hardware settings can accelerate and diversify the development of approaches, for the benefit of the research community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate taxonomic identification is the cornerstone of biodiversity monitoring and agricultural management, particularly for the hyper-diverse superfamily Ichneumonoidea. Comprising the families Ichneumonidae and Braconidae, these parasitoid wasps are ecologically critical for regulating insect populations, yet they remain one of the most taxonomically challenging groups due to their cryptic morphology and vast number of undescribed species. To address the scarcity of robust digital resources for these key groups, we present a curated image dataset designed to advance automated identification systems. The dataset contains 3,556 high-resolution images, primarily focused on Neotropical Ichneumonidae and Braconidae, while also including supplementary families such as Andrenidae, Apidae, Bethylidae, Chrysididae, Colletidae, Halictidae, Megachilidae, Pompilidae, and Vespidae to improve model robustness. Crucially, a subset of 1,739 images is annotated in COCO format, featuring multi-class bounding boxes for the full insect body, wing venation, and scale bars. This resource provides a foundation for developing computer vision models capable of identifying these families.</description>

      <title>Closing the gap in multimodal medical representation alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multimodal learning, CLIP has emerged as the de-facto approach for mapping different modalities into a shared latent space by bringing semantically similar representations closer while pushing apart dissimilar ones. However, CLIP-based contrastive losses exhibit unintended behaviors that negatively impact true semantic alignment, leading to sparse and fragmented latent spaces. This phenomenon, known as the modality gap, has been partially mitigated for standard text and image pairs but remains unknown and unresolved in more complex multimodal settings, such as the medical domain. In this work, we study this phenomenon in the latter case, revealing that the modality gap is present also in medical alignment, and we propose a modality-agnostic framework that closes this gap, ensuring that semantically related representations are more aligned, regardless of their source modality. Our method enhances alignment between radiology images and clinical text, improving cross-modal retrieval and image captioning.</description>

      <title>SEAL-pose: Enhancing 3D Human Pose Estimation via a Learned Loss for Structural Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D human pose estimation (HPE) is characterized by intricate local and global dependencies among joints. Conventional supervised losses are limited in capturing these correlations because they treat each joint independently. Previous studies have attempted to promote structural consistency through manually designed priors or rule-based constraints; however, these approaches typically require manual specification and are often non-differentiable, limiting their use as end-to-end training objectives. We propose SEAL-pose, a data-driven framework in which a learnable loss-net trains a pose-net by evaluating structural plausibility. Rather than relying on hand-crafted priors, our joint-graph-based design enables the loss-net to learn complex structural dependencies directly from data. Extensive experiments on three 3D HPE benchmarks with eight backbones show that SEAL-pose reduces per-joint errors and improves pose plausibility compared with the corresponding backbones across all settings. Beyond improving each backbone, SEAL-pose also outperforms models with explicit structural constraints, despite not enforcing any such constraints. Finally, we analyze the relationship between the loss-net and structural consistency, and evaluate SEAL-pose in cross-dataset and in-the-wild settings.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Defense Strategies for Robust Image Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based image watermarking, while robust against conventional distortions, remains vulnerable to advanced adversarial and regeneration attacks. Conventional countermeasures, which jointly optimize the encoder and decoder via a noise layer, face 2 inevitable challenges: (1) decrease of clean accuracy due to decoder adversarial training and (2) limited robustness due to simultaneous training of all three advanced attacks. To overcome these issues, we propose AdvMark, a novel two-stage fine-tuning framework that decouples the defense strategies. In stage 1, we address adversarial vulnerability via a tailored adversarial training paradigm that primarily fine-tunes the encoder while only conditionally updating the decoder. This approach learns to move the image into a non-attackable region, rather than modifying the decision boundary, thus preserving clean accuracy. In stage 2, we tackle distortion and regeneration attacks via direct image optimization. To preserve the adversarial robustness gained in stage 1, we formulate a principled, constrained image loss with theoretical guarantees, which balances the deviation from cover and previous encoded images. We also propose a quality-aware early-stop to further guarantee the lower bound of visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate AdvMark outperforms with the highest image quality and comprehensive robustness, i.e. up to 29\%, 33\% and 46\% accuracy improvement for distortion, regeneration and adversarial attacks, respectively.</description>

      <title>MeanFuser: Fast One-Step Multi-Modal Trajectory Generation and Adaptive Reconstruction via MeanFlow for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models have shown great potential in trajectory planning. Recent studies demonstrate that anchor-guided generative models are effective in modeling the uncertainty of driving behaviors and improving overall performance. However, these methods rely on discrete anchor vocabularies that must sufficiently cover the trajectory distribution during testing to ensure robustness, inducing an inherent trade-off between vocabulary size and model performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose MeanFuser, an end-to-end autonomous driving method that enhances both efficiency and robustness through three key designs. (1) We introduce Gaussian Mixture Noise (GMN) to guide generative sampling, enabling a continuous representation of the trajectory space and eliminating the dependency on discrete anchor vocabularies. (2) We adapt ``MeanFlow Identity" to end-to-end planning, which models the mean velocity field between GMN and trajectory distribution instead of the instantaneous velocity field used in vanilla flow matching methods, effectively eliminating numerical errors from ODE solvers and significantly accelerating inference. (3) We design a lightweight Adaptive Reconstruction Module (ARM) that enables the model to implicitly select from all sampled proposals or reconstruct a new trajectory when none is satisfactory via attention weights. Experiments on the NAVSIM closed-loop benchmark demonstrate that MeanFuser achieves outstanding performance without the supervision of the PDM Score. and exceptional inference efficiency, offering a robust and efficient solution for end-to-end autonomous driving.

      <title>HeatPrompt: Zero-Shot Vision-Language Modeling of Urban Heat Demand from Satellite Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate heat-demand maps play a crucial role in decarbonizing space heating, yet most municipalities lack detailed building-level data needed to calculate them. We introduce HeatPrompt, a zero-shot vision-language energy modeling framework that estimates annual heat demand using semantic features extracted from satellite images, basic Geographic Information System (GIS), and building-level features. We feed pretrained Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) with a domain-specific prompt to act as an energy planner and extract the visual attributes such as roof age, building density, etc, from the RGB satellite image that correspond to the thermal load. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regressor trained on these captions shows an $R^2$ uplift of 93.7% and shrinks the mean absolute error (MAE) by 30% compared to the baseline model. Qualitative analysis shows that high-impact tokens align with high-demand zones, offering lightweight support for heat planning in data-scarce regions.</description>

      <title>The Invisible Gorilla Effect in Out-of-distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks achieve high performance in vision tasks by learning features from regions of interest (ROI) within images, but their performance degrades when deployed on out-of-distribution (OOD) data that differs from training data. This challenge has led to OOD detection methods that aim to identify and reject unreliable predictions. Although prior work shows that OOD detection performance varies by artefact type, the underlying causes remain underexplored. To this end, we identify a previously unreported bias in OOD detection: for hard-to-detect artefacts (near-OOD), detection performance typically improves when the artefact shares visual similarity (e.g. colour) with the model's ROI and drops when it does not - a phenomenon we term the Invisible Gorilla Effect. For example, in a skin lesion classifier with red lesion ROI, we show the method Mahalanobis Score achieves a 31.5% higher AUROC when detecting OOD red ink (similar to ROI) compared to black ink (dissimilar) annotations. We annotated artefacts by colour in 11,355 images from three public datasets (e.g. ISIC) and generated colour-swapped counterfactuals to rule out dataset bias. We then evaluated 40 OOD methods across 7 benchmarks and found significant performance drops for most methods when artefacts differed from the ROI. Our findings highlight an overlooked failure mode in OOD detection and provide guidance for more robust detectors.

      <title>SemanticNVS: Improving Semantic Scene Understanding in Generative Novel View Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SemanticNVS, a camera-conditioned multi-view diffusion model for novel view synthesis (NVS), which improves generation quality and consistency by integrating pre-trained semantic feature extractors. Existing NVS methods perform well for views near the input view, however, they tend to generate semantically implausible and distorted images under long-range camera motion, revealing severe degradation. We speculate that this degradation is due to current models failing to fully understand their conditioning or intermediate generated scene content. Here, we propose to integrate pre-trained semantic feature extractors to incorporate stronger scene semantics as conditioning to achieve high-quality generation even at distant viewpoints. We investigate two different strategies, (1) warped semantic features and (2) an alternating scheme of understanding and generation at each denoising step. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the clear qualitative and quantitative (4.69%-15.26% in FID) improvement over state-of-the-art alternatives.</description>

      <title>Do Large Language Models Understand Data Visualization Principles?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data visualization principles, derived from decades of research in design and perception, ensure proper visual communication. While prior work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can generate charts or flag misleading figures, it remains unclear whether they and their vision-language counterparts (VLMs) can reason about and enforce visualization principles directly. Constraint based systems encode these principles as logical rules for precise automated checks, but translating them into formal specifications demands expert knowledge. This motivates leveraging LLMs and VLMs as principle checkers that can reason about visual design directly, bypassing the need for symbolic rule specification. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of both LLMs and VLMs on their ability to reason about visualization principles, using hard verification ground truth derived from Answer Set Programming (ASP). We compiled a set of visualization principles expressed as natural-language statements and generated a controlled dataset of approximately 2,000 Vega-Lite specifications annotated with explicit principle violations, complemented by over 300 real-world Vega-Lite charts. We evaluated both checking and fixing tasks, assessing how well models detect principle violations and correct flawed chart specifications. Our work highlights both the promise of large (vision-)language models as flexible validators and editors of visualization designs and the persistent gap with symbolic solvers on more nuanced aspects of visual perception. They also reveal an interesting asymmetry: frontier models tend to be more effective at correcting violations than at detecting them reliably.</description>

      <title>StructXLIP: Enhancing Vision-language Models with Multimodal Structural Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge-based representations are fundamental cues for visual understanding, a principle rooted in early vision research and still central today. We extend this principle to vision-language alignment, showing that isolating and aligning structural cues across modalities can greatly benefit fine-tuning on long, detail-rich captions, with a specific focus on improving cross-modal retrieval. We introduce StructXLIP, a fine-tuning alignment paradigm that extracts edge maps (e.g., Canny), treating them as proxies for the visual structure of an image, and filters the corresponding captions to emphasize structural cues, making them "structure-centric". Fine-tuning augments the standard alignment loss with three structure-centric losses: (i) aligning edge maps with structural text, (ii) matching local edge regions to textual chunks, and (iii) connecting edge maps to color images to prevent representation drift. From a theoretical standpoint, while standard CLIP maximizes the mutual information between visual and textual embeddings, StructXLIP additionally maximizes the mutual information between multimodal structural representations. This auxiliary optimization is intrinsically harder, guiding the model toward more robust and semantically stable minima, enhancing vision-language alignment. Beyond outperforming current competitors on cross-modal retrieval in both general and specialized domains, our method serves as a general boosting recipe that can be integrated into future approaches in a plug-and-play manner. Code and pretrained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/intelligolabs/StructXLIP.</description>

      <title>Transcending the Annotation Bottleneck: AI-Powered Discovery in Biology and Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dependence on expert annotation has long constituted the primary rate-limiting step in the application of artificial intelligence to biomedicine. While supervised learning drove the initial wave of clinical algorithms, a paradigm shift towards unsupervised and self-supervised learning (SSL) is currently unlocking the latent potential of biobank-scale datasets. By learning directly from the intrinsic structure of data - whether pixels in a magnetic resonance image (MRI), voxels in a volumetric scan, or tokens in a genomic sequence - these methods facilitate the discovery of novel phenotypes, the linkage of morphology to genetics, and the detection of anomalies without human bias. This article synthesises seminal and recent advances in "learning without labels," highlighting how unsupervised frameworks can derive heritable cardiac traits, predict spatial gene expression in histology, and detect pathologies with performance that rivals or exceeds supervised counterparts.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Unlearning for Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research in machine unlearning (MU) has gained strong momentum: MU is now widely regarded as a critical capability for building safe and fair AI. In parallel, research into transformer architectures for computer vision tasks has been highly successful: Increasingly, Vision Transformers (VTs) emerge as strong alternatives to CNNs. Yet, MU research for vision tasks has largely centered on CNNs, not VTs. While benchmarking MU efforts have addressed LLMs, diffusion models, and CNNs, none exist for VTs. This work is the first to attempt this, benchmarking MU algorithm performance in different VT families (ViT and Swin-T) and at different capacities. The work employs (i) different datasets, selected to assess the impacts of dataset scale and complexity; (ii) different MU algorithms, selected to represent fundamentally different approaches for MU; and (iii) both single-shot and continual unlearning protocols. Additionally, it focuses on benchmarking MU algorithms that leverage training data memorization, since leveraging memorization has been recently discovered to significantly improve the performance of previously SOTA algorithms. En route, the work characterizes how VTs memorize training data relative to CNNs, and assesses the impact of different memorization proxies on performance. The benchmark uses unified evaluation metrics that capture two complementary notions of forget quality along with accuracy on unseen (test) data and on retained data. Overall, this work offers a benchmarking basis, enabling reproducible, fair, and comprehensive comparisons of existing (and future) MU algorithms on VTs. And, for the first time, it sheds light on how well existing algorithms work in VT settings, establishing a promising reference performance baseline.</description>

      <title>Do Large Language Models Understand Data Visualization Rules?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data visualization rules-derived from decades of research in design and perception-ensure trustworthy chart communication. While prior work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can generate charts or flag misleading figures, it remains unclear whether they can reason about and enforce visualization rules directly. Constraint-based systems such as Draco encode these rules as logical constraints for precise automated checks, but maintaining symbolic encodings requires expert effort, motivating the use of LLMs as flexible rule validators. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of LLMs against visualization rules using hard-verification ground truth derived from Answer Set Programming (ASP). We translated a subset of Draco's constraints into natural-language statements and generated a controlled dataset of 2,000 Vega-Lite specifications annotated with explicit rule violations. LLMs were evaluated on both accuracy in detecting violations and prompt adherence, which measures whether outputs follow the required structured format. Results show that frontier models achieve high adherence (Gemma 3 4B / 27B: 100%, GPT-oss 20B: 98%) and reliably detect common violations (F1 up to 0.82),yet performance drops for subtler perceptual rules (F1 &lt; 0.15 for some categories) and for outputs generated from technical ASP formulations.Translating constraints into natural language improved performance by up to 150% for smaller models. These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs as flexible, language-driven validators while highlighting their current limitations compared to symbolic solvers.</description>

      <title>Flow3r: Factored Flow Prediction for Scalable Visual Geometry Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current feed-forward 3D/4D reconstruction systems rely on dense geometry and pose supervision -- expensive to obtain at scale and particularly scarce for dynamic real-world scenes. We present Flow3r, a framework that augments visual geometry learning with dense 2D correspondences (`flow') as supervision, enabling scalable training from unlabeled monocular videos. Our key insight is that the flow prediction module should be factored: predicting flow between two images using geometry latents from one and pose latents from the other. This factorization directly guides the learning of both scene geometry and camera motion, and naturally extends to dynamic scenes. In controlled experiments, we show that factored flow prediction outperforms alternative designs and that performance scales consistently with unlabeled data. Integrating factored flow into existing visual geometry architectures and training with ${\sim}800$K unlabeled videos, Flow3r achieves state-of-the-art results across eight benchmarks spanning static and dynamic scenes, with its largest gains on in-the-wild dynamic videos where labeled data is most scarce.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid progress in video models has largely focused on visual quality, leaving their reasoning capabilities underexplored. Video reasoning grounds intelligence in spatiotemporally consistent visual environments that go beyond what text can naturally capture, enabling intuitive reasoning over spatiotemporal structure such as continuity, interaction, and causality. However, systematically studying video reasoning and its scaling behavior is hindered by the lack of large-scale training data. To address this gap, we introduce the Very Big Video Reasoning (VBVR) Dataset, an unprecedentedly large-scale resource spanning 200 curated reasoning tasks following a principled taxonomy and over one million video clips, approximately three orders of magnitude larger than existing datasets. We further present VBVR-Bench, a verifiable evaluation framework that moves beyond model-based judging by incorporating rule-based, human-aligned scorers, enabling reproducible and interpretable diagnosis of video reasoning capabilities. Leveraging the VBVR suite, we conduct one of the first large-scale scaling studies of video reasoning and observe early signs of emergent generalization to unseen reasoning tasks. Together, VBVR lays a foundation for the next stage of research in generalizable video reasoning. The data, benchmark toolkit, and models are publicly available at https://video-reason.com/ .</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose tttLRM, a novel large 3D reconstruction model that leverages a Test-Time Training (TTT) layer to enable long-context, autoregressive 3D reconstruction with linear computational complexity, further scaling the model's capability. Our framework efficiently compresses multiple image observations into the fast weights of the TTT layer, forming an implicit 3D representation in the latent space that can be decoded into various explicit formats, such as Gaussian Splats (GS) for downstream applications. The online learning variant of our model supports progressive 3D reconstruction and refinement from streaming observations. We demonstrate that pretraining on novel view synthesis tasks effectively transfers to explicit 3D modeling, resulting in improved reconstruction quality and faster convergence. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in feedforward 3D Gaussian reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art approaches on both objects and scenes.</description>

      <title>Mobile-O: Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation on Mobile Device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unified multimodal models can both understand and generate visual content within a single architecture. Existing models, however, remain data-hungry and too heavy for deployment on edge devices. We present Mobile-O, a compact vision-language-diffusion model that brings unified multimodal intelligence to a mobile device. Its core module, the Mobile Conditioning Projector (MCP), fuses vision-language features with a diffusion generator using depthwise-separable convolutions and layerwise alignment. This design enables efficient cross-modal conditioning with minimal computational cost. Trained on only a few million samples and post-trained in a novel quadruplet format (generation prompt, image, question, answer), Mobile-O jointly enhances both visual understanding and generation capabilities. Despite its efficiency, Mobile-O attains competitive or superior performance compared to other unified models, achieving 74% on GenEval and outperforming Show-O and JanusFlow by 5% and 11%, while running 6x and 11x faster, respectively. For visual understanding, Mobile-O surpasses them by 15.3% and 5.1% averaged across seven benchmarks. Running in only ~3s per 512x512 image on an iPhone, Mobile-O establishes the first practical framework for real-time unified multimodal understanding and generation on edge devices. We hope Mobile-O will ease future research in real-time unified multimodal intelligence running entirely on-device with no cloud dependency. Our code, models, datasets, and mobile application are publicly available at https://amshaker.github.io/Mobile-O/</description>

      <title>Can Multimodal LLMs See Science Instruction? Benchmarking Pedagogical Reasoning in K-12 Classroom Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: K-12 science classrooms are rich sites of inquiry where students coordinate phenomena, evidence, and explanatory models through discourse; yet, the multimodal complexity of these interactions has made automated analysis elusive. Existing benchmarks for classroom discourse focus primarily on mathematics and rely solely on transcripts, overlooking the visual artifacts and model-based reasoning emphasized by the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). We address this gap with SciIBI, the first video benchmark for analyzing science classroom discourse, featuring 113 NGSS-aligned clips annotated with Core Instructional Practices (CIP) and sophistication levels. By evaluating eight state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs, we reveal fundamental limitations: current models struggle to distinguish pedagogically similar practices, suggesting that CIP coding requires instructional reasoning beyond surface pattern matching. Furthermore, adding video input yields inconsistent gains across architectures. Crucially, our evidence-based evaluation reveals that models often succeed through surface shortcuts rather than genuine pedagogical understanding. These findings establish science classroom discourse as a challenging frontier for multimodal AI and point toward human-AI collaboration, where models retrieve evidence to accelerate expert review rather than replace it.</description>

      <title>Wide Open Gazes: Quantifying Visual Exploratory Behavior in Soccer with Pose Enhanced Positional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to measuring visual exploratory behavior in soccer rely on counting visual exploratory actions (VEAs) based on rapid head movements exceeding 125{\deg}/s, but this method suffer from player position bias (i.e., a focus on central midfielders), annotation challenges, binary measurement constraints (i.e., a player is scanning, or not), lack the power to predict relevant short-term in-game future success, and are incompatible with fundamental soccer analytics models such as pitch control. This research introduces a novel formulaic continuous stochastic vision layer to quantify players' visual perception from pose-enhanced spatiotemporal tracking. Our probabilistic field-of-view and occlusion models incorporate head and shoulder rotation angles to create speed-dependent vision maps for individual players in a two-dimensional top-down plane. We combine these vision maps with pitch control and pitch value surfaces to analyze the awaiting phase (when a player is awaiting the ball to arrive after a pass for a teammate) and their subsequent on-ball phase. We demonstrate that aggregated visual metrics - such as the percentage of defended area observed while awaiting a pass - are predictive of controlled pitch value gained at the end of dribbling actions using 32 games of synchronized pose-enhanced tracking data and on-ball event data from the 2024 Copa America. This methodology works regardless of player position, eliminates manual annotation requirements, and provides continuous measurements that seamlessly integrate into existing soccer analytics frameworks. To further support the integration with existing soccer analytics frameworks we open-source the tools required to make these calculations.</description>

      <title>Triggering hallucinations in model-based MRI reconstruction via adversarial perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models are increasingly used to improve the quality of medical imaging, such as reconstruction of magnetic resonance images and computed tomography. However, it is well-known that such models are susceptible to hallucinations: they may insert features into the reconstructed image which are not actually present in the original image. In a medical setting, such hallucinations may endanger patient health as they can lead to incorrect diagnoses. In this work, we aim to quantify the extent to which state-of-the-art generative models suffer from hallucinations in the context of magnetic resonance image reconstruction. Specifically, we craft adversarial perturbations resembling random noise for the unprocessed input images which induce hallucinations when reconstructed using a generative model. We perform this evaluation on the brain and knee images from the fastMRI data set using UNet and end-to-end VarNet architectures to reconstruct the images. Our results show that these models are highly susceptible to small perturbations and can be easily coaxed into producing hallucinations. This fragility may partially explain why hallucinations occur in the first place and suggests that a carefully constructed adversarial training routine may reduce their prevalence. Moreover, these hallucinations cannot be reliably detected using traditional image quality metrics. Novel approaches will therefore need to be developed to detect when hallucinations have occurred.</description>

      <title>4D-UNet improves clutter rejection in human transcranial contrast enhanced ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasound imaging is limited by high skull absorption, limiting vascular imaging to only the largest vessels. Traditional clutter filters struggle with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ultrasound datasets, where blood and tissue signals cannot be easily separated, even when the echogenicity of the blood is improved with contrast agents. Here, we present a novel 4D U-Net approach for clutter filtering in transcranial 3D Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) exploiting spatial and temporal information via a 4D-UNet implementation to enhance microbubble detection in transcranial data acquired in human adults. Our results show that the 4D-UNet improves temporal clutter filters. By integrating deep learning into CEUS, this study advances neurovascular imaging, offering improved clutter rejection and visualization. The findings underscore the potential of AI-driven approaches to enhance ultrasound-based medical imaging, paving the way for more accurate diagnostics and broader clinical applications.</description>

      <title>GIST: Targeted Data Selection for Instruction Tuning via Coupled Optimization Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Targeted data selection has emerged as a crucial paradigm for efficient instruction tuning, aiming to identify a small yet influential subset of training examples for a specific target task. In practice, influence is often measured through the effect of an example on parameter updates. To make selection scalable, many approaches leverage optimizer statistics (e.g., Adam states) as an axis-aligned surrogate for update geometry (i.e., diagonal precondition), implicitly treating parameters as coordinate-wise independent. We show that this assumption breaks down in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA. In this setting, the induced optimization geometry exhibits strong cross-parameter coupling with non-trivial off-diagonal interactions, while the task-relevant update directions are confined to a low-dimensional subspace. Motivated by this mismatch, we propose GIST (Gradient Isometric Subspace Transformation), a simple yet principled alternative that replaces axis-aligned scaling with robust subspace alignment. GIST recovers a task-specific subspace from validation gradients via spectral filtering (SVD), projects training gradients into this coupled subspace, and scores examples by their alignment with target directions.Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GIST matches or outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline with only 0.29% of the storage and 25% of the computational time under the same selection budget.</description>

      <title>DM4CT: Benchmarking Diffusion Models for Computed Tomography Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse problems. While computed tomography (CT) is theoretically a linear inverse problem, it poses many practical challenges. These include correlated noise, artifact structures, reliance on system geometry, and misaligned value ranges, which make the direct application of diffusion models more difficult than in domains like natural image generation. To systematically evaluate how diffusion models perform in this context and compare them with established reconstruction methods, we introduce DM4CT, a comprehensive benchmark for CT reconstruction. DM4CT includes datasets from both medical and industrial domains with sparse-view and noisy configurations. To explore the challenges of deploying diffusion models in practice, we additionally acquire a high-resolution CT dataset at a high-energy synchrotron facility and evaluate all methods under real experimental conditions. We benchmark ten recent diffusion-based methods alongside seven strong baselines, including model-based, unsupervised, and supervised approaches. Our analysis provides detailed insights into the behavior, strengths, and limitations of diffusion models for CT reconstruction. The real-world dataset is publicly available at zenodo.org/records/15420527, and the codebase is open-sourced at github.com/DM4CT/DM4CT.</description>

      <title>OVerSeeC: Open-Vocabulary Costmap Generation from Satellite Images and Natural Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aerial imagery provides essential global context for autonomous navigation, enabling route planning at scales inaccessible to onboard sensing. We address the problem of generating global costmaps for long-range planning directly from satellite imagery when entities and mission-specific traversal rules are expressed in natural language at test time. This setting is challenging since mission requirements vary, terrain entities may be unknown at deployment, and user prompts often encode compositional traversal logic. Existing approaches relying on fixed ontologies and static cost mappings cannot accommodate such flexibility. While foundation models excel at language interpretation and open-vocabulary perception, no single model can simultaneously parse nuanced mission directives, locate arbitrary entities in large-scale imagery, and synthesize them into an executable cost function for planners. We therefore propose OVerSeeC, a zero-shot modular framework that decomposes the problem into Interpret-Locate-Synthesize: (i) an LLM extracts entities and ranked preferences, (ii) an open-vocabulary segmentation pipeline identifies these entities from high-resolution imagery, and (iii) the LLM uses the user's natural language preferences and masks to synthesize executable costmap code. Empirically, OVerSeeC handles novel entities, respects ranked and compositional preferences, and produces routes consistent with human-drawn trajectories across diverse regions, demonstrating robustness to distribution shifts. This shows that modular composition of foundation models enables open-vocabulary, preference-aligned costmap generation for scalable, mission-adaptive global planning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With fault-tolerant quantum computing on the horizon, there is growing interest in applying quantum computational methods to data-intensive scientific fields like remote sensing. Quantum machine learning (QML) has already demonstrated potential for such demanding tasks. One area of particular focus is quantum data fusion -- a complex data analysis problem that has attracted significant recent attention. In this work, we introduce an automated QML (AQML) approach for addressing data fusion challenges. We evaluate how AQML-generated quantum circuits perform compared to classical multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and manually designed QML models when processing multisource inputs. Furthermore, we apply our method to change detection using the multispectral ONERA dataset, achieving improved accuracy over previously reported QML-based change detection results.</description>

      <title>Information-Guided Noise Allocation for Efficient Diffusion Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training diffusion models typically relies on manually tuned noise schedules, which can waste computation on weakly informative noise regions and limit transfer across datasets, resolutions, and representations. We revisit noise schedule allocation through an information-theoretic lens and propose the conditional entropy rate of the forward process as a theoretically grounded, data-dependent diagnostic for identifying suboptimal noise-level allocation in existing schedules. Based on these insight, we introduce InfoNoise, a principled data-adaptive training noise schedule that replaces heuristic schedule design with an information-guided noise sampling distribution derived from entropy-reduction rates estimated from denoising losses already computed during training. Across natural-image benchmarks, InfoNoise matches or surpasses tuned EDM-style schedules, in some cases with a substantial training speedup (about $1.4\times$ on CIFAR-10). On discrete datasets, where standard image-tuned schedules exhibit significant mismatch, it reaches superior quality in up to $3\times$ fewer training steps. Overall, InfoNoise makes noise scheduling data-adaptive, reducing the need for per-dataset schedule design as diffusion models expand across domains.</description>

      <title>Systematic Analysis of Coupling Effects on Closed-Loop and Open-Loop Performance in Aerial Continuum Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates two distinct approaches to the dynamic modeling of aerial continuum manipulators (ACMs): the decoupled and the coupled formulations. Both open-loop and closed-loop behaviors of a representative ACM are analyzed. The primary objective is to determine the conditions under which the decoupled model attains accuracy comparable to the coupled model while offering reduced computational cost under identical numerical conditions. The system dynamics are first derived using the Euler--Lagrange method under the piecewise constant curvature (PCC) assumption, with explicit treatment of the near-zero curvature singularity. A decoupled model is then obtained by neglecting the coupling terms in the ACM dynamics, enabling systematic evaluation of open-loop responses under diverse actuation profiles and external wrenches. To extend the analysis to closed-loop performance, a novel dynamics-based proportional-derivative sliding mode image-based visual servoing (DPD-SM-IBVS) controller is developed for regulating image feature errors in the presence of a moving target. The controller is implemented with both coupled and decoupled models, allowing a direct comparison of their effectiveness. The open-loop simulations reveal pronounced discrepancies between the two modeling approaches, particularly under varying torque inputs and continuum arm parameters. Conversely, the closed-loop experiments demonstrate that the decoupled model achieves tracking accuracy on par with the coupled model (within subpixel error) while incurring lower computational cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How does the brain predict physical outcomes while acting in the world? Machine learning world models compress visual input into latent spaces, discarding the spatial structure that characterizes sensory cortex. We propose isomorphic world models: architectures preserving sensory topology so that physics prediction becomes geometric propagation rather than abstract state transition. We implement this using neural fields with motor-gated channels, where activity evolves through local lateral connectivity and motor commands multiplicatively modulate specific populations. Three experiments support this approach: (1) local connectivity is sufficient to learn ballistic physics, with predictions traversing intermediate locations rather than "teleporting"; (2) policies trained entirely in imagination transfer to real physics at nearly twice the rate of latent-space alternatives; and (3) motor-gated channels spontaneously develop body-selective encoding through visuomotor prediction alone. These findings suggest intuitive physics and body schema may share a common origin in spatially structured neural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Phase-Consistent Magnetic Spectral Learning for Multi-View Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to partition data into meaningful groups by leveraging complementary information from multiple views without labels, yet a central challenge is to obtain a reliable shared structural signal to guide representation learning and cross-view alignment under view discrepancy and noise. Existing approaches often rely on magnitude-only affinities or early pseudo targets, which can be unstable when different views induce relations with comparable strengths but contradictory directional tendencies, thereby distorting the global spectral geometry and degrading clustering. In this paper, we propose \emph{Phase-Consistent Magnetic Spectral Learning} for MVC: we explicitly model cross-view directional agreement as a phase term and combine it with a nonnegative magnitude backbone to form a complex-valued magnetic affinity, extract a stable shared spectral signal via a Hermitian magnetic Laplacian, and use it as structured self-supervision to guide unsupervised multi-view representation learning and clustering. To obtain robust inputs for spectral extraction at scale, we construct a compact shared structure with anchor-based high-order consensus modeling and apply a lightweight refinement to suppress noisy or inconsistent relations. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines.</description>

      <title>Compact Hadamard Latent Codes for Efficient Spectral Rendering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral rendering accurately reproduces wavelength-dependent appearance but is computationally expensive, as shading must be evaluated at many wavelength samples and scales roughly linearly with the number of samples. It also requires spectral textures and lights throughout the rendering pipeline. We propose Hadamard spectral codes, a compact latent representation that enables spectral rendering using standard RGB rendering operations. Spectral images are approximated with a small number of RGB rendering passes, followed by a decoding step. Our key requirement is latent linearity: scaling and addition in spectral space correspond to scaling and addition of codes, and the element-wise product of spectra (for example reflectance times illumination) is approximated by the element-wise product of their latent codes. We show that an exact low-dimensional algebra-preserving representation cannot exist for arbitrary spectra when the latent dimension k is smaller than the number of spectral samples n. We therefore introduce a learned non-negative linear encoder and decoder architecture that preserves scaling and addition exactly while encouraging approximate multiplicativity under the Hadamard product. With k = 6, we render k/3 = 2 RGB images per frame using an unmodified RGB renderer, reconstruct the latent image, and decode to high-resolution spectra or XYZ or RGB. Experiments on 3D scenes demonstrate that k = 6 significantly reduces color error compared to RGB baselines while being substantially faster than naive n-sample spectral rendering. Using k = 9 provides higher-quality reference results. We further introduce a lightweight neural upsampling network that maps RGB assets directly to latent codes, enabling integration of legacy RGB content into the spectral pipeline while maintaining perceptually accurate colors in rendered images.</description>

      <title>RoboCurate: Harnessing Diversity with Action-Verified Neural Trajectory for Robot Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data generated by video generative models has shown promise for robot learning as a scalable pipeline, but it often suffers from inconsistent action quality due to imperfectly generated videos. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have been leveraged to validate video quality, but they have limitations in distinguishing physically accurate videos and, even then, cannot directly evaluate the generated actions themselves. To tackle this issue, we introduce RoboCurate, a novel synthetic robot data generation framework that evaluates and filters the quality of annotated actions by comparing them with simulation replay. Specifically, RoboCurate replays the predicted actions in a simulator and assesses action quality by measuring the consistency of motion between the simulator rollout and the generated video. In addition, we unlock observation diversity beyond the available dataset via image-to-image editing and apply action-preserving video-to-video transfer to further augment appearance. We observe RoboCurate's generated data yield substantial relative improvements in success rates compared to using real data only, achieving +70.1% on GR-1 Tabletop (300 demos), +16.1% on DexMimicGen in the pre-training setup, and +179.9% in the challenging real-world ALLEX humanoid dexterous manipulation setting.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Lottery Ticket Hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are a useful tool for uncertainty quantification, but require substantially more computational resources than conventional neural networks. For non-Bayesian networks, the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) posits the existence of sparse subnetworks that can train to the same or even surpassing accuracy as the original dense network. Such sparse networks can lower the demand for computational resources at inference, and during training. The existence of the LTH and corresponding sparse subnetworks in BNNs could motivate the development of sparse training algorithms and provide valuable insights into the underlying training process. Towards this end, we translate the LTH experiments to a Bayesian setting using common computer vision models. We investigate the defining characteristics of Bayesian lottery tickets, and extend our study towards a transplantation method connecting BNNs with deterministic Lottery Tickets. We generally find that the LTH holds in BNNs, and winning tickets of matching and surpassing accuracy are present independent of model size, with degradation at very high sparsities. However, the pruning strategy should rely primarily on magnitude, secondly on standard deviation. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that models rely on mask structure and weight initialization to varying degrees.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Busemann Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic spaces provide a natural geometry for representing hierarchical and tree-structured data due to their exponential volume growth. To leverage these benefits, neural networks require intrinsic and efficient components that operate directly in hyperbolic space. In this work, we lift two core components of neural networks, Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) and Fully Connected (FC) layers, into hyperbolic space via Busemann functions, resulting in Busemann MLR (BMLR) and Busemann FC (BFC) layers with a unified mathematical interpretation. BMLR provides compact parameters, a point-to-horosphere distance interpretation, batch-efficient computation, and a Euclidean limit, while BFC generalizes FC and activation layers with comparable complexity. Experiments on image classification, genome sequence learning, node classification, and link prediction demonstrate improvements in effectiveness and efficiency over prior hyperbolic layers.

      <title>TIACam: Text-Anchored Invariant Feature Learning with Auto-Augmentation for Camera-Robust Zero-Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Camera recapture introduces complex optical degradations, such as perspective warping, illumination shifts, and Moir\'e interference, that remain challenging for deep watermarking systems. We present TIACam, a text-anchored invariant feature learning framework with auto-augmentation for camera-robust zero-watermarking. The method integrates three key innovations: (1) a learnable auto-augmentor that discovers camera-like distortions through differentiable geometric, photometric, and Moir\'e operators; (2) a text-anchored invariant feature learner that enforces semantic consistency via cross-modal adversarial alignment between image and text; and (3) a zero-watermarking head that binds binary messages in the invariant feature space without modifying image pixels. This unified formulation jointly optimizes invariance, semantic alignment, and watermark recoverability. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world camera captures demonstrate that TIACam achieves state-of-the-art feature stability and watermark extraction accuracy, establishing a principled bridge between multimodal invariance learning and physically robust zero-watermarking.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Residual Morphological Substructure Using Supervised and Unsupervised Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated characterization of galactic substructure is an essential step in understanding the transformative physical processes driving galaxy evolution. In this study, we investigate the application of deep learning (DL) frameworks to characterize different galactic substructures hosted within parametric light-profile subtracted ``residual'' images of a large sample galaxies from the CANDELS survey. We develop a supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and unsupervised Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CvAE) and train it on the single-S\'ersic profile fitting based residual images of $10,046$ bright and massive galaxies ($H&lt;24.5\,{\rm mag}$ and $M_{\rm stellar} \geq 10^{9.5}\,M_{\odot}$) spanning $1&lt;z&lt;3$, in conjunction with their visual-based classification labels indicating the nature of residual substructures hosted within them. Using our unique data preprocessing approach, we prepare our residual images such that the inputs to our DL networks comprise only ``galaxy of interest'', and augment them such that our sample span uniformly across different residual characteristics. We assess the latent space of the CNN and CvAE using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) along with independently quantified metrics of residual strength (significant pixel flux $SPF$, Bumpiness, and Residual Flux Fraction). We also employ an unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) based clustering scheme with Support Vector Classification (SVC) to identify groupings in PCA space that correspond to similar residual substructure. We find that our supervised CNN latent features in PCA space correlate with the $SPF$ values and distinguish between qualitatively strong and weak residual substructures. While our unsupervised CvAE latent space also correlates with visual and quantitative residual characteristics, but lacks clear discriminatory power when characterizing different residual substructures.</description>

      <title>PrivacyBench: Privacy Isn't Free in Hybrid Privacy-Preserving Vision Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Privacy preserving machine learning deployments in sensitive deep learning applications; from medical imaging to autonomous systems; increasingly require combining multiple techniques. Yet, practitioners lack systematic guidance to assess the synergistic and non-additive interactions of these hybrid configurations, relying instead on isolated technique analysis that misses critical system level interactions. We introduce PrivacyBench, a benchmarking framework that reveals striking failures in privacy technique combinations with severe deployment implications. Through systematic evaluation across ResNet18 and ViT models on medical datasets, we uncover that FL + DP combinations exhibit severe convergence failure, with accuracy dropping from 98% to 13% while compute costs and energy consumption substantially increase. In contrast, FL + SMPC maintains near-baseline performance with modest overhead. Our framework provides the first systematic platform for evaluating privacy-utility-cost trade-offs through automated YAML configuration, resource monitoring, and reproducible experimental protocols. PrivacyBench enables practitioners to identify problematic technique interactions before deployment, moving privacy-preserving computer vision from ad-hoc evaluation toward principled systems design. These findings demonstrate that privacy techniques cannot be composed arbitrarily and provide critical guidance for robust deployment in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>PCA-VAE: Differentiable Subspace Quantization without Codebook Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector-quantized autoencoders deliver high-fidelity latents but suffer inherent flaws: the quantizer is non-differentiable, requires straight-through hacks, and is prone to collapse. We address these issues at the root by replacing VQ with a simple, principled, and fully differentiable alternative: an online PCA bottleneck trained via Oja's rule. The resulting model, PCA-VAE, learns an orthogonal, variance-ordered latent basis without codebooks, commitment losses, or lookup noise. Despite its simplicity, PCA-VAE exceeds VQ-GAN and SimVQ in reconstruction quality on CelebAHQ while using 10-100x fewer latent bits. It also produces naturally interpretable dimensions (e.g., pose, lighting, gender cues) without adversarial regularization or disentanglement objectives. These results suggest that PCA is a viable replacement for VQ: mathematically grounded, stable, bit-efficient, and semantically structured, offering a new direction for generative models beyond vector quantization.</description>

      <title>DeepInterestGR: Mining Deep Multi-Interest Using Multi-Modal LLMs for Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent generative recommendation frameworks have demonstrated remarkable scaling potential by reformulating item prediction as autoregressive Semantic ID (SID) generation. However, existing methods primarily rely on shallow behavioral signals, encoding items solely through surface-level textual features such as titles and descriptions. This reliance results in a critical Shallow Interest problem: the model fails to capture the latent, semantically rich interests underlying user interactions, limiting both personalization depth and recommendation interpretability. DeepInterestGR introduces three key innovations: (1) Multi-LLM Interest Mining (MLIM): We leverage multiple frontier LLMs along with their multi-modal variants to extract deep textual and visual interest representations through Chain-of-Thought prompting. (2) Reward-Labeled Deep Interest (RLDI): We employ a lightweight binary classifier to assign reward labels to mined interests, enabling effective supervision signals for reinforcement learning. (3) Interest-Enhanced Item Discretization (IEID): The curated deep interests are encoded into semantic embeddings and quantized into SID tokens via RQ-VAE. We adopt a two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning aligns the generative model with deep interest signals and collaborative filtering patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with GRPO optimized by our Interest-Aware Reward. Experiments on three Amazon Review benchmarks demonstrate that DeepInterestGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across HR@K and NDCG@K metrics.</description>

      <title>A Markovian View of Iterative-Feedback Loops in Image Generative Models: Neural Resonance and Model Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI training datasets will inevitably contain AI-generated examples, leading to ``feedback'' in which the output of one model impacts the training of another. It is known that such iterative feedback can lead to model collapse, yet the mechanisms underlying this degeneration remain poorly understood. Here we show that a broad class of feedback processes converges to a low-dimensional invariant structure in latent space, a phenomenon we call neural resonance. By modeling iterative feedback as a Markov Chain, we show that two conditions are needed for this resonance to occur: ergodicity of the feedback process and directional contraction of the latent representation. By studying diffusion models on MNIST and ImageNet, as well as CycleGAN and an audio feedback experiment, we map how local and global manifold geometry evolve, and we introduce an eight-pattern taxonomy of collapse behaviors. Neural resonance provides a unified explanation for long-term degenerate behavior in generative models and provides practical diagnostics for identifying, characterizing, and eventually mitigating collapse.</description>

      <title>Automated Disentangling Analysis of Skin Colour for Lesion Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning models working on skin images often have degraded performance when the skin colour captured in images (SCCI) differs between training and deployment. Such differences arise from entangled environmental factors (e.g., illumination, camera settings), and intrinsic factors (e.g., skin tone) that cannot be accurately described by a single "skin tone" scalar. To mitigate such colour mismatch, we propose a skin-colour disentangling framework that adapts disentanglement-by-compression to learn a structured, manipulable latent space for SCCI from unlabelled dermatology images. To prevent information leakage that hinders proper learning of dark colour features, we introduce a randomized, mostly monotonic decolourization mapping. To suppress unintended colour shifts of localized patterns (e.g., ink marks, scars) during colour manipulation, we further propose a geometry-aligned post-processing step. Together, these components enable faithful counterfactual editing and answering an essential question: "What would this skin condition look like under a different SCCI?", as well as direct colour transfer between images and controlled traversal along physically meaningful directions (e.g., blood perfusion, camera white balance), enabling educational visualization of skin conditions under varying SCCI. We demonstrate that dataset-level augmentation and colour normalization based on our framework achieve competitive lesion classification performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This brief presents a runtime-adaptive, performance-enhanced vector engine featuring a low-resource, iterative CORDIC-based MAC unit for edge AI acceleration. The proposed design enables dynamic reconfiguration between approximate and accurate modes, exploiting the latency-accuracy trade-off for a wide range of workloads. Its resource-efficient approach further enables up to 4x throughput improvement within the same hardware resources by leveraging vectorised, time-multiplexed execution and flexible precision scaling. With a time-multiplexed multi-AF block and a lightweight pooling and normalisation unit, the proposed vector engine supports flexible precision (4/8/16-bit) and high MAC density. The ASIC implementation results show that each MAC stage can save up to 33% of time and 21% of power, with a 256-PE configuration that achieves higher compute density (4.83 TOPS/mm2 ) and energy efficiency (11.67 TOPS/W) than previous state-of-the-art work. A detailed hardware-software co-design methodology for object detection and classification tasks on Pynq-Z2 is discussed to assess the proposed architecture, demonstrating a scalable, energy-efficient solution for edge AI applications.</description>

      <title>WildOS: Open-Vocabulary Object Search in the Wild</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation in complex, unstructured outdoor environments requires robots to operate over long ranges without prior maps and limited depth sensing. In such settings, relying solely on geometric frontiers for exploration is often insufficient. In such settings, the ability to reason semantically about where to go and what is safe to traverse is crucial for robust, efficient exploration. This work presents WildOS, a unified system for long-range, open-vocabulary object search that combines safe geometric exploration with semantic visual reasoning. WildOS builds a sparse navigation graph to maintain spatial memory, while utilizing a foundation-model-based vision module, ExploRFM, to score frontier nodes of the graph. ExploRFM simultaneously predicts traversability, visual frontiers, and object similarity in image space, enabling real-time, onboard semantic navigation tasks. The resulting vision-scored graph enables the robot to explore semantically meaningful directions while ensuring geometric safety. Furthermore, we introduce a particle-filter-based method for coarse localization of the open-vocabulary target query, that estimates candidate goal positions beyond the robot's immediate depth horizon, enabling effective planning toward distant goals. Extensive closed-loop field experiments across diverse off-road and urban terrains demonstrate that WildOS enables robust navigation, significantly outperforming purely geometric and purely vision-based baselines in both efficiency and autonomy. Our results highlight the potential of vision foundation models to drive open-world robotic behaviors that are both semantically informed and geometrically grounded.

      <title>Time Series, Vision, and Language: Exploring the Limits of Alignment in Contrastive Representation Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis posits that learned representations from models trained on different modalities converge to a shared latent structure of the world. However, this hypothesis has largely been examined in vision and language, and it remains unclear whether time series participate in such convergence. We first examine this in a trimodal setting and find that independently pretrained time series, vision, and language encoders exhibit near-orthogonal geometry in the absence of explicit coupling. We then apply post-hoc alignment by training projection heads over frozen encoders using contrastive learning, and analyze the resulting representations with respect to geometry, scaling behavior, and dependence on information density and input modality characteristics. Our investigation reveals that overall alignment in contrastive representation spaces improves with model size, but this alignment is asymmetric: time series align more strongly with visual representations than with text, and images can act as effective intermediaries between time series and language. We further see that richer textual descriptions improve alignment only up to a threshold; training on denser captions does not lead to further improvement. Analogous effects are observed for visual representations. Our findings shed light on considerations for building multimodal systems involving non-conventional data modalities beyond vision and language.</description>

      <title>Seeing Farther and Smarter: Value-Guided Multi-Path Reflection for VLM Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving complex, long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks requires a deep understanding of physical interactions, reasoning about their long-term consequences, and precise high-level planning. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a general perceive-reason-act framework for this goal. However, previous approaches using reflective planning to guide VLMs in correcting actions encounter significant limitations. These methods rely on inefficient and often inaccurate implicit learning of state-values from noisy foresight predictions, evaluate only a single greedy future, and suffer from substantial inference latency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel test-time computation framework that decouples state evaluation from action generation. This provides a more direct and fine-grained supervisory signal for robust decision-making. Our method explicitly models the advantage of an action plan, quantified by its reduction in distance to the goal, and uses a scalable critic to estimate. To address the stochastic nature of single-trajectory evaluation, we employ beam search to explore multiple future paths and aggregate them during decoding to model their expected long-term returns, leading to more robust action generation. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight, confidence-based trigger that allows for early exit when direct predictions are reliable, invoking reflection only when necessary. Extensive experiments on diverse, unseen multi-stage robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate a 24.6% improvement in success rate over state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly reducing inference time by 56.5%.</description>

      <title>Structured Bitmap-to-Mesh Triangulation for Geometry-Aware Discretization of Image-Derived Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a template-driven triangulation framework that embeds raster- or segmentation-derived boundaries into a regular triangular grid for stable PDE discretization on image-derived domains. Unlike constrained Delaunay triangulation (CDT), which may trigger global connectivity updates, our method retriangulates only triangles intersected by the boundary, preserves the base mesh, and supports synchronization-free parallel execution. To ensure determinism and scalability, we classify all local boundary-intersection configurations up to discrete equivalence and triangle symmetries, yielding a finite symbolic lookup table that maps each case to a conflict-free retriangulation template. We prove that the resulting mesh is closed, has bounded angles, and is compatible with cotangent-based discretizations and standard finite element methods. Experiments on elliptic and parabolic PDEs, signal interpolation, and structural metrics show fewer sliver elements, more regular triangles, and improved geometric fidelity near complex boundaries. The framework is well suited for real-time geometric analysis and physically based simulation over image-derived domains.</description>

      <title>Variational Trajectory Optimization of Anisotropic Diffusion Schedules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a variational framework for diffusion models with anisotropic noise schedules parameterized by a matrix-valued path $M_t(\theta)$ that allocates noise across subspaces. Central to our framework is a trajectory-level objective that jointly trains the score network and learns $M_t(\theta)$, which encompasses general parameterization classes of matrix-valued noise schedules. We further derive an estimator for the derivative with respect to $\theta$ of the score that enables efficient optimization of the $M_t(\theta)$ schedule. For inference, we develop an efficiently-implementable reverse-ODE solver that is an anisotropic generalization of the second-order Heun discretization algorithm. Across CIFAR-10, AFHQv2, FFHQ, and ImageNet-64, our method consistently improves upon the baseline EDM model in all NFE regimes.

      <title>Classroom Final Exam: An Instructor-Tested Reasoning Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce \CFE{} (\textbf{C}lassroom \textbf{F}inal \textbf{E}xam), a multimodal benchmark for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models across more than 20 STEM domains. \CFE{} is curated from repeatedly used, authentic university homework and exam problems, together with reference solutions provided by course instructors. \CFE{} presents a significant challenge even for frontier models: the newly released Gemini-3.1-pro-preview achieves an overall accuracy of 59.69\%, while the second-best model, Gemini-3-flash-preview, reaches 55.46\%, leaving considerable room for improvement. Beyond leaderboard results, we perform a diagnostic analysis by decomposing reference solutions into reasoning flows. We find that although frontier models can often answer intermediate sub-questions correctly, they struggle to reliably derive and maintain correct intermediate states throughout multi-step solutions. We further observe that model-generated solutions typically have more reasoning steps than those provided by the instructor, indicating suboptimal step efficiency and a higher risk of error accumulation. The data and code are available at https://github.com/Analogy-AI/CFE_Bench.</description>

      <title>Sculpting the Vector Space: Towards Efficient Multi-Vector Visual Document Retrieval via Prune-then-Merge Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Document Retrieval (VDR), which aims to retrieve relevant pages within vast corpora of visually-rich documents, is of significance in current multimodal retrieval applications. The state-of-the-art multi-vector paradigm excels in performance but suffers from prohibitive overhead, a problem that current efficiency methods like pruning and merging address imperfectly, creating a difficult trade-off between compression rate and feature fidelity. To overcome this dilemma, we introduce Prune-then-Merge, a novel two-stage framework that synergizes these complementary approaches. Our method first employs an adaptive pruning stage to filter out low-information patches, creating a refined, high-signal set of embeddings. Subsequently, a hierarchical merging stage compresses this pre-filtered set, effectively summarizing semantic content without the noise-induced feature dilution seen in single-stage methods. Extensive experiments on 29 VDR datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms existing methods, significantly extending the near-lossless compression range and providing robust performance at high compression ratios.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Framework for Aligning Human Linguistic Descriptions with Visual Perceptual Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Establishing stable mappings between natural language expressions and visual percepts is a foundational problem for both cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Humans routinely ground linguistic reference in noisy, ambiguous perceptual contexts, yet the mechanisms supporting such cross-modal alignment remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a computational framework designed to model core aspects of human referential interpretation by integrating linguistic utterances with perceptual representations derived from large-scale, crowd-sourced imagery. The system approximates human perceptual categorization by combining scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) alignment with the Universal Quality Index (UQI) to quantify similarity in a cognitively plausible feature space, while a set of linguistic preprocessing and query-transformation operations captures pragmatic variability in referring expressions. We evaluate the model on the Stanford Repeated Reference Game corpus (15,000 utterances paired with tangram stimuli), a paradigm explicitly developed to probe human-level perceptual ambiguity and coordination. Our framework achieves robust referential grounding. It requires 65\% fewer utterances than human interlocutors to reach stable mappings and can correctly identify target objects from single referring expressions 41.66\% of the time (versus 20\% for humans).These results suggest that relatively simple perceptual-linguistic alignment mechanisms can yield human-competitive behavior on a classic cognitive benchmark, and offers insights into models of grounded communication, perceptual inference, and cross-modal concept formation.

      <title>Iconographic Classification and Content-Based Recommendation for Digitized Artworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a proof-of-concept system that automates iconographic classification and content-based recommendation of digitized artworks using the Iconclass vocabulary and selected artificial intelligence methods. The prototype implements a four-stage workflow for classification and recommendation, which integrates YOLOv8 object detection with algorithmic mappings to Iconclass codes, rule-based inference for abstract meanings, and three complementary recommenders (hierarchical proximity, IDF-weighted overlap, and Jaccard similarity). Although more engineering is still needed, the evaluation demonstrates the potential of this solution: Iconclass-aware computer vision and recommendation methods can accelerate cataloging and enhance navigation in large heritage repositories. The key insight is to let computer vision propose visible elements and to use symbolic structures (Iconclass hierarchy) to reach meaning.</description>

      <title>Using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Semantic Segmentation for Pulmonary Embolism Detection in Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While deep learning has demonstrated considerable promise in computer-aided diagnosis for pulmonary embolism (PE), practical deployment in Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is often hindered by "domain shift" and the prohibitive cost of expert annotations. To address these challenges, an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) framework is proposed, utilizing a Transformer backbone and a Mean-Teacher architecture for cross-center semantic segmentation. The primary focus is placed on enhancing pseudo-label reliability by learning deep structural information within the feature space. Specifically, three modules are integrated and designed for this task: (1) a Prototype Alignment (PA) mechanism to reduce category-level distribution discrepancies; (2) Global and Local Contrastive Learning (GLCL) to capture both pixel-level topological relationships and global semantic representations; and (3) an Attention-based Auxiliary Local Prediction (AALP) module designed to reinforce sensitivity to small PE lesions by automatically extracting high-information slices from Transformer attention maps. Experimental validation conducted on cross-center datasets (FUMPE and CAD-PE) demonstrates significant performance gains. In the FUMPE -&gt; CAD-PE task, the IoU increased from 0.1152 to 0.4153, while the CAD-PE -&gt; FUMPE task saw an improvement from 0.1705 to 0.4302. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved a 69.9% Dice score in the CT -&gt; MRI cross-modality task on the MMWHS dataset without utilizing any target-domain labels for model selection, confirming its robustness and generalizability for diverse clinical environments.</description>

      <title>Expanding the Role of Diffusion Models for Robust Classifier Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating diffusion-generated synthetic data into adversarial training (AT) has been shown to substantially improve the training of robust image classifiers. In this work, we extend the role of diffusion models beyond merely generating synthetic data, examining whether their internal representations, which encode meaningful features of the data, can provide additional benefits for robust classifier training. Through systematic experiments, we show that diffusion models offer representations that are both diverse and partially robust, and that explicitly incorporating diffusion representations as an auxiliary learning signal during AT consistently improves robustness across settings. Furthermore, our representation analysis indicates that incorporating diffusion models into AT encourages more disentangled features, while diffusion representations and diffusion-generated synthetic data play complementary roles in shaping representations. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet validate these findings, demonstrating the effectiveness of jointly leveraging diffusion representations and synthetic data within AT.</description>

      <title>EEG-Driven Intention Decoding: Offline Deep Learning Benchmarking on a Robotic Rover</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide a hands-free control modality for mobile robotics, yet decoding user intent during real-world navigation remains challenging. This work presents a brain-robot control framework for offline decoding of driving commands during robotic rover operation. A 4WD Rover Pro platform was remotely operated by 12 participants who navigated a predefined route using a joystick, executing the commands forward, reverse, left, right, and stop. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded with a 16-channel OpenBCI cap and aligned with motor actions at Delta = 0 ms and future prediction horizons (Delta &gt; 0 ms). After preprocessing, several deep learning models were benchmarked, including convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and Transformer architectures. ShallowConvNet achieved the highest performance for both action prediction and intent prediction. By combining real-world robotic control with multi-horizon EEG intention decoding, this study introduces a reproducible benchmark and reveals key design insights for predictive deep learning-based BCI systems.</description>

      <title>To Move or Not to Move: Constraint-based Planning Enables Zero-Shot Generalization for Interactive Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual navigation typically assumes the existence of at least one obstacle-free path between start and goal, which must be discovered/planned by the robot. However, in real-world scenarios, such as home environments and warehouses, clutter can block all routes. Targeted at such cases, we introduce the Lifelong Interactive Navigation problem, where a mobile robot with manipulation abilities can move clutter to forge its own path to complete sequential object- placement tasks - each involving placing an given object (eg. Alarm clock, Pillow) onto a target object (eg. Dining table, Desk, Bed). To address this lifelong setting - where effects of environment changes accumulate and have long-term effects - we propose an LLM-driven, constraint-based planning framework with active perception. Our framework allows the LLM to reason over a structured scene graph of discovered objects and obstacles, deciding which object to move, where to place it, and where to look next to discover task-relevant information. This coupling of reasoning and active perception allows the agent to explore the regions expected to contribute to task completion rather than exhaustively mapping the environment. A standard motion planner then executes the corresponding navigate-pick-place, or detour sequence, ensuring reliable low-level control. Evaluated in physics-enabled ProcTHOR-10k simulator, our approach outperforms non-learning and learning-based baselines. We further demonstrate our approach qualitatively on real-world hardware.</description>

      <title>NovaPlan: Zero-Shot Long-Horizon Manipulation via Closed-Loop Video Language Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving long-horizon tasks requires robots to integrate high-level semantic reasoning with low-level physical interaction. While vision-language models (VLMs) and video generation models can decompose tasks and imagine outcomes, they often lack the physical grounding necessary for real-world execution. We introduce NovaPlan, a hierarchical framework that unifies closed-loop VLM and video planning with geometrically grounded robot execution for zero-shot long-horizon manipulation. At the high level, a VLM planner decomposes tasks into sub-goals and monitors robot execution in a closed loop, enabling the system to recover from single-step failures through autonomous re-planning. To compute low-level robot actions, we extract and utilize both task-relevant object keypoints and human hand poses as kinematic priors from the generated videos, and employ a switching mechanism to choose the better one as a reference for robot actions, maintaining stable execution even under heavy occlusion or depth inaccuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NovaPlan on three long-horizon tasks and the Functional Manipulation Benchmark (FMB). Our results show that NovaPlan can perform complex assembly tasks and exhibit dexterous error recovery behaviors without any prior demonstrations or training.

      <title>Simulation-Ready Cluttered Scene Estimation via Physics-aware Joint Shape and Pose Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating simulation-ready scenes from real-world observations is crucial for downstream planning and policy learning tasks. Regretfully, existing methods struggle in cluttered environments, often exhibiting prohibitive computational cost, poor robustness, and restricted generality when scaling to multiple interacting objects. We propose a unified optimization-based formulation for real-to-sim scene estimation that jointly recovers the shapes and poses of multiple rigid objects under physical constraints. Our method is built on two key technical innovations. First, we leverage the recently introduced shape-differentiable contact model, whose global differentiability permits joint optimization over object geometry and pose while modeling inter-object contacts. Second, we exploit the structured sparsity of the augmented Lagrangian Hessian to derive an efficient linear system solver whose computational cost scales favorably with scene complexity. Building on this formulation, we develop an end-to-end real-to-sim scene estimation pipeline that integrates learning-based object initialization, physics-constrained joint shape-pose optimization, and differentiable texture refinement. Experiments on cluttered scenes with up to 5 objects and 22 convex hulls demonstrate that our approach robustly reconstructs physically valid, simulation-ready object shapes and poses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel Face Pyramid Vision Transformer (FPVT) is proposed to learn a discriminative multi-scale facial representations for face recognition and verification. In FPVT, Face Spatial Reduction Attention (FSRA) and Dimensionality Reduction (FDR) layers are employed to make the feature maps compact, thus reducing the computations. An Improved Patch Embedding (IPE) algorithm is proposed to exploit the benefits of CNNs in ViTs (e.g., shared weights, local context, and receptive fields) to model lower-level edges to higher-level semantic primitives. Within FPVT framework, a Convolutional Feed-Forward Network (CFFN) is proposed that extracts locality information to learn low level facial information. The proposed FPVT is evaluated on seven benchmark datasets and compared with ten existing state-of-the-art methods, including CNNs, pure ViTs, and Convolutional ViTs. Despite fewer parameters, FPVT has demonstrated excellent performance over the compared methods. Project page is available at https://khawar-islam.github.io/fpvt/</description>

      <title>Learning to See the Elephant in the Room: Self-Supervised Context Reasoning in Humans and AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.12817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans rarely perceive objects in isolation but interpret scenes through relationships among co-occurring elements. How such contextual knowledge is acquired without explicit supervision remains unclear. Here we combine human psychophysics experiments with computational modelling to study the emergence of contextual reasoning. Participants were exposed to novel objects embedded in naturalistic scenes that followed predefined contextual rules capturing global context, local context and crowding. After viewing short training videos, participants completed a "lift-the-flap" task in which a hidden object had to be inferred from the surrounding context under variations in size, resolution and spatial arrangement. Humans rapidly learned these contextual associations without labels or feedback and generalised robustly across contextual changes. We then introduce SeCo (Self-supervised learning for Context Reasoning), a biologically inspired model that learns contextual relationships from complex scenes. SeCo encodes targets and context with separate vision encoders and stores latent contextual priors in a learnable external memory module. Given contextual cues, the model retrieves likely object representations to infer hidden targets. SeCo outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches and predicts object placements most consistent with human behaviour, highlighting the central role of contextual associations in scene understanding.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Runge-Kutta Dynamics for Spatiotemporal Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal prediction is important in solving natural problems and processing video frames, especially in weather forecasting and human action recognition. Recent advances attempt to incorporate prior physical knowledge into the deep learning framework to estimate the unknown governing partial differential equations (PDEs) in complex dynamics, which have shown promising results in spatiotemporal prediction tasks. However, previous approaches only restrict neural network architectures or loss functions to acquire physical or PDE features, which decreases the representative capacity of a neural network. Meanwhile, the updating process of the physical state cannot be effectively estimated. To solve the problems mentioned above, we introduce a physical-guided neural network, which utilizes an adaptive second-order Runge-Kutta method with physical constraints to model the physical states more precisely. Furthermore, we propose a frequency-enhanced Fourier module to strengthen the model's ability to estimate the spatiotemporal dynamics. We evaluate our model on both spatiotemporal and video prediction tasks. The experimental results show that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and performs the best in several spatiotemporal scenarios with a much smaller parameter count.</description>

      <title>(PASS) Visual Prompt Locates Good Structure Sparsity through a Recurrent HyperNetwork</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance in different domains like vision and language processing, although at the cost of massive computation resources. As illustrated by compression literature, structural model pruning is a prominent algorithm to encourage model efficiency, thanks to its acceleration-friendly sparsity patterns. One of the key questions of structural pruning is how to estimate the channel significance. In parallel, work on data-centric AI has shown that prompting-based techniques enable impressive generalization of large language models across diverse downstream tasks. In this paper, we investigate a charming possibility - \textit{leveraging visual prompts to capture the channel importance and derive high-quality structural sparsity}. To this end, we propose a novel algorithmic framework, namely \texttt{PASS}. It is a tailored hyper-network to take both visual prompts and network weight statistics as input, and output layer-wise channel sparsity in a recurrent manner. Such designs consider the intrinsic channel dependency between layers. Comprehensive experiments across multiple network architectures and six datasets demonstrate the superiority of \texttt{PASS} in locating good structural sparsity. For example, at the same FLOPs level, \texttt{PASS} subnetworks achieve $1\%\sim 3\%$ better accuracy on Food101 dataset; or with a similar performance of $80\%$ accuracy, \texttt{PASS} subnetworks obtain $0.35\times$ more speedup than the baselines.</description>

      <title>$R^2$-Mesh: Reinforcement Learning Powered Mesh Reconstruction via Geometry and Appearance Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mesh reconstruction from Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is widely used in 3D reconstruction and has been applied across numerous domains. However, existing methods typically rely solely on the given training set images, which restricts supervision to limited observations and makes it difficult to fully constrain geometry and appearance. Moreover, the contribution of each viewpoint for training is not uniform and changes dynamically during the optimization process, which can result in suboptimal guidance for both geometric refinement and rendering quality. To address these limitations, we propose $R^2$-Mesh, a reinforcement learning framework that combines NeRF-rendered pseudo-supervision with online viewpoint selection. Our key insight is to exploit NeRF's rendering ability to synthesize additional high-quality images, enriching training with diverse viewpoint information. To ensure that supervision focuses on the most beneficial perspectives, we introduce a UCB-based strategy with a geometry-aware reward, which dynamically balances exploration and exploitation to identify informative viewpoints throughout training. Within this framework, we jointly optimize SDF geometry and view-dependent appearance under differentiable rendering, while periodically refining meshes to capture fine geometric details. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive results in both geometric accuracy and rendering quality.</description>

Abstract: Neural representations of 3D data have been widely adopted across various applications, particularly in recent work leveraging coordinate-based networks to model scalar or vector fields. However, these approaches face inherent challenges, such as handling thin structures and non-watertight geometries, which limit their flexibility and accuracy. In contrast, we propose a novel geometric data representation that models geometry as distributions-a powerful representation that makes no assumptions about surface genus, connectivity, or boundary conditions. Our approach uses diffusion models with a novel network architecture to learn surface point distributions, capturing fine-grained geometric details. We evaluate our representation qualitatively and quantitatively across various object types, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving high geometric fidelity. Additionally, we explore applications using our representation, such as textured mesh representation, neural surface compression, dynamic object modeling, and rendering, highlighting its potential to advance 3D geometric learning.</description>

      <title>MEt3R: Measuring Multi-View Consistency in Generated Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce MEt3R, a metric for multi-view consistency in generated images. Large-scale generative models for multi-view image generation are rapidly advancing the field of 3D inference from sparse observations. However, due to the nature of generative modeling, traditional reconstruction metrics are not suitable to measure the quality of generated outputs and metrics that are independent of the sampling procedure are desperately needed. In this work, we specifically address the aspect of consistency between generated multi-view images, which can be evaluated independently of the specific scene. Our approach uses DUSt3R to obtain dense 3D reconstructions from image pairs in a feed-forward manner, which are used to warp image contents from one view into the other. Then, feature maps of these images are compared to obtain a similarity score that is invariant to view-dependent effects. Using MEt3R, we evaluate the consistency of a large set of previous methods for novel view and video generation, including our open, multi-view latent diffusion model.</description>

      <title>Exploring Interpretability for Visual Prompt Tuning with Cross-layer Concepts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual prompt tuning offers significant advantages for adapting pre-trained visual foundation models to specific tasks. However, current research provides limited insight into the interpretability of this approach, which is essential for enhancing AI reliability and enabling AI-driven knowledge discovery. In this paper, rather than learning abstract prompt embeddings, we propose the first framework, named Interpretable Visual Prompt Tuning (IVPT), to explore interpretability for visual prompts by introducing cross-layer concept prototypes. Specifically, visual prompts are linked to human-understandable semantic concepts, represented as a set of category-agnostic prototypes, each corresponding to a specific region of the image. IVPT then aggregates features from these regions to generate interpretable prompts for multiple network layers, allowing the explanation of visual prompts at different network depths and semantic granularities. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on fine-grained classification benchmarks show its superior interpretability and performance over visual prompt tuning methods and existing interpretable methods.</description>

      <title>Hier-COS: Making Deep Features Hierarchy-aware via Composition of Orthogonal Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional classifiers treat all labels as mutually independent, thereby considering all negative classes to be equally incorrect. This approach fails severely in many real-world scenarios, where a known semantic hierarchy defines a partial order of preferences over negative classes. While hierarchy-aware feature representations have shown promise in mitigating this problem, their performance is typically assessed using metrics like MS and AHD. In this paper, we highlight important shortcomings in existing hierarchical evaluation metrics, demonstrating that they are often incapable of measuring true hierarchical performance. Our analysis reveals that existing methods learn sub-optimal hierarchical representations, despite competitive MS and AHD scores. To counter these issues, we introduce Hier-COS, a novel framework for unified hierarchy-aware fine-grained and hierarchical multi-level classification. We show that Hier-COS is theoretically guaranteed to be consistent with the given hierarchy tree. Furthermore, our framework implicitly adapts the learning capacity for different classes based on their position within the hierarchy tree-a vital property absent in existing methods. Finally, to address the limitations of evaluation metrics, we propose HOPS, a ranking-based metric that demonstrably overcomes the deficiencies of current evaluation standards. We benchmark Hier-COS on four challenging datasets, including the deep and imbalanced tieredImageNet-H and iNaturalist-19. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Hier-COS achieves SOTA across all hierarchical metrics for every dataset, while simultaneously beating the top-1 accuracy in all but one case. Lastly, we show that Hier-COS can effectively learn to transform the frozen features extracted from a pretrained backbone (ViT) to be hierarchy-aware, yielding substantial benefits for hierarchical classification performance.</description>

      <title>SphOR: A Representation Learning Perspective on Open-set Recognition for Identifying Unknown Classes in Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reliance on Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based classifiers in safety-critical and real-world applications necessitates Open-Set Recognition (OSR). OSR enables the identification of input data from classes unknown during training as unknown, as opposed to misclassifying them as belonging to a known class. DNNs consist of a feature extraction backbone and classifier head; however, most OSR methods typically train both components jointly, often yielding feature representations that adapt poorly to unknown data. Other approaches employ off-the-shelf objectives, such as supervised contrastive learning, which are not specifically designed for OSR. To address these limitations, we propose SpHOR, which explicitly shapes the feature space via supervised representation learning, before training a classifier. Instead of relying on generic feature learning, SpHOR custom-designs representation learning for OSR through three key innovations: (1) enforcing discriminative class-specific features via orthogonal label embeddings, ensuring clearer separation between classes. (2) imposing a spherical constraint, modeling representations as a mixture of von Mises-Fisher distributions. (3) integrating Mixup and Label Smoothing (LS) directly into the representation learning stage. To quantify how these techniques enhance representations for OSR, we introduce two metrics: the Angular Separability (AS) and Norm Separability (NS). Combining all three innovations, SpHOR achieves state-of-the-art results (in AUROC and OSCR) across various coarse-grained and fine-grained open-set benchmarks, particularly excelling on the Semantic Shift Benchmark with improvements up to 5.1\%.

      <title>PSGait: Gait Recognition using Parsing Skeleton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gait recognition has emerged as a robust biometric modality due to its non-intrusive nature. Conventional gait recognition methods mainly rely on silhouettes or skeletons. While effective in controlled laboratory settings, their limited information entropy restricts generalization to real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we propose a novel representation called \textbf{Parsing Skeleton}, which uses a skeleton-guided human parsing method to capture fine-grained body dynamics with much higher information entropy. To effectively explore the capability of the Parsing Skeleton, we also introduce \textbf{PSGait}, a framework that fuses Parsing Skeleton with silhouettes to enhance individual differentiation. Comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate that PSGait outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal methods while significantly reducing computational resources. As a plug-and-play method, it achieves an improvement of up to 15.7\% in the accuracy of Rank-1 in various models. These results validate the Parsing Skeleton as a \textbf{lightweight}, \textbf{effective}, and highly \textbf{generalizable} representation for gait recognition in the wild.

      <title>VideoMind: A Chain-of-LoRA Agent for Temporal-Grounded Video Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Videos, with their unique temporal dimension, demand precise grounded understanding, where answers are directly linked to visual, interpretable evidence. Despite significant breakthroughs in text-based reasoning with large language models, multi-modal reasoning - especially for videos - remains limited. In this work, we fill this gap by introducing VideoMind, a novel video-language agent for temporal-grounded video reasoning. Our method involves two key innovations: (1) We identify four essential capabilities for grounded video reasoning and propose a role-based agentic workflow, comprising a planner to coordinate roles, a grounder for temporal event localization, a verifier to assess event candidates, and an answerer for question answering. (2) To efficiently integrate these roles during inference, we propose a novel Chain-of-LoRA mechanism, where a unified base model with multiple LoRA adapters is leveraged to enable seamless role switching, balancing efficiency and flexibility. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks across Grounded VideoQA, Video Temporal Grounding, and General VideoQA tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in advancing video agent, test-time scaling, and long-form video reasoning. Code, models, datasets, and demos are available at https://videomind.github.io/.</description>

      <title>ShapeShift: Text-to-Mosaic Synthesis via Semantic Phase-Field Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present ShapeShift, a method for arranging rigid objects into configurations that visually convey semantic concepts specified by natural language. While pretrained diffusion models provide powerful semantic guidance, such as Score Distillation Sampling, enforcing physical validity poses a fundamental challenge. Naive overlap resolution disrupts semantic structure -- separating overlapping shapes along geometrically optimal directions (minimum translation vectors) often destroys the very arrangements that make concepts recognizable.
  Our intuition is that diffusion model features encode not just what a concept looks like, but its geometric, directional structure -- how it is oriented and shaped -- which we leverage to make overlap resolution semantically aware. We introduce a deformable boundary represented as a phase field that expands anisotropically, guided by intermediate features from the diffusion model, creating space along semantically coherent directions. Experiments demonstrate that ShapeShift, by coupling semantic guidance and feasibility constraint resolution, produces arrangements achieving both semantic clarity and overlap-free validity, significantly outperforming baselines that treat these objectives independently.</description>

      <title>Can Vision-Language Models Answer Face to Face Questions in the Real-World?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19356v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI models have made significant strides in recent years in their ability to describe and answer questions about real-world images. They have also made progress in the ability to converse with users in real-time using audio input. This raises the question: have we reached the point where AI models, connected to a camera and microphone, can converse with users in real-time about scenes and events that are unfolding live in front of the camera? This has been a long-standing goal in AI and is a prerequisite for real-world AI assistants and humanoid robots to interact with humans in everyday situations. In this work, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark, the Qualcomm Interactive Video Dataset (IVD), which allows us to assess the extent to which existing models can support these abilities, and to what degree these capabilities can be instilled through fine-tuning. The dataset is based on a simple question-answering setup, where users ask questions that the system has to answer, in real-time, based on the camera and audio input. We show that existing models fall far behind human performance on this task, and we identify the main sources for the performance gap. However, we also show that for many of the required perceptual skills, fine-tuning on this form of data can significantly reduce this gap.</description>

      <title>Learn by Reasoning: Analogical Weight Generation for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental Learning (FSCIL) enables models to learn new classes from limited data while retaining performance on previously learned classes. Traditional FSCIL methods often require fine-tuning parameters with limited new class data and suffer from a separation between learning new classes and utilizing old knowledge. Inspired by the analogical learning mechanisms of the human brain, we propose a novel analogical generative method. Our approach includes the Brain-Inspired Analogical Generator (BiAG), which derives new class weights from existing classes without parameter fine-tuning during incremental stages. BiAG consists of three components: Weight Self-Attention Module (WSA), Weight &amp; Prototype Analogical Attention Module (WPAA), and Semantic Conversion Module (SCM). SCM uses Neural Collapse theory for semantic conversion, WSA supplements new class weights, and WPAA computes analogies to generate new class weights. Experiments on miniImageNet, CUB-200, and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves higher final and average accuracy compared to SOTA methods.</description>

      <title>JavisDiT: Joint Audio-Video Diffusion Transformer with Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Prior Synchronization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces JavisDiT, a novel Joint Audio-Video Diffusion Transformer designed for synchronized audio-video generation (JAVG). Based on the powerful Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, JavisDiT simultaneously generates high-quality audio and video content from open-ended user prompts in a unified framework. To ensure audio-video synchronization, we introduce a fine-grained spatio-temporal alignment mechanism through a Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Synchronized Prior (HiST-Sypo) Estimator. This module extracts both global and fine-grained spatio-temporal priors, guiding the synchronization between the visual and auditory components. Furthermore, we propose a new benchmark, JavisBench, which consists of 10,140 high-quality text-captioned sounding videos and focuses on synchronization evaluation in diverse and complex real-world scenarios. Further, we specifically devise a robust metric for measuring the synchrony between generated audio-video pairs in real-world content. Experimental results demonstrate that JavisDiT significantly outperforms existing methods by ensuring both high-quality generation and precise synchronization, setting a new standard for JAVG tasks. Our code, model, and data are available at https://javisverse.github.io/JavisDiT-page/.</description>

      <title>Order Matters: On Parameter-Efficient Image-to-Video Probing for Recognizing Nearly Symmetric Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-grained understanding of human actions is essential for safe and intuitive human--robot interaction. We study the challenge of recognizing nearly symmetric actions, such as picking up vs. placing down a tool or opening vs. closing a drawer. These actions are common in close human-robot collaboration, yet they are rare and largely overlooked in mainstream vision frameworks. Pretrained vision foundation models (VFMs) are often adapted using probing, valued in robotics for its efficiency and low data needs, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which adds temporal modeling through adapters or prompts. However, our analysis shows that probing is permutation-invariant and blind to frame order, while PEFT is prone to overfitting on smaller HRI datasets, and less practical in real-world robotics due to compute constraints.
  To address this, we introduce STEP (Self-attentive Temporal Embedding Probing), a lightweight extension to probing that models temporal order via frame-wise positional encodings, a global CLS token, and a simplified attention block. Compared to conventional probing, STEP improves accuracy by 4--10% on nearly symmetric actions and 6--15% overall across action recognition benchmarks in human-robot-interaction, industrial assembly, and driver assistance. Beyond probing, STEP surpasses heavier PEFT methods and even outperforms fully fine-tuned models on all three benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code and models will be made publicly available: https://github.com/th-nesh/STEP.</description>

      <title>Meta-DAN: towards an efficient prediction strategy for page-level handwritten text recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in text recognition led to a paradigm shift for page-level recognition, from multi-step segmentation-based approaches to end-to-end attention-based ones. However, the na\"ive character-level autoregressive decoding process results in long prediction times: it requires several seconds to process a single page image on a modern GPU. We propose the Meta Document Attention Network (Meta-DAN) as a novel decoding strategy to reduce the prediction time while enabling a better context modeling. It relies on two main components: windowed queries, to process several transformer queries altogether, enlarging the context modeling with near future; and multi-token predictions, whose goal is to predict several tokens per query instead of only the next one. We evaluate the proposed approach on 10 full-page handwritten datasets and demonstrate state-of-the-art results on average in terms of character error rate. Source code and weights of trained models are available at https://github.com/FactoDeepLearning/meta_dan.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Landmark detection is central to many medical applications, such as identifying critical structures for treatment planning or defining control points for biometric measurements. However, manual annotation is labor-intensive and requires expert anatomical knowledge. While deep learning shows promise in automating this task, fair evaluation and interpretation of methods in a broader context are hindered by limited public benchmarking, inconsistent baseline implementations, and non-standardized experimentation. To overcome these pitfalls, we present nnLandmark, a self-configuring framework for 3D landmark detection that combines tailored heatmap generation, loss design, inference logic, and a robust set of hyperparameters for heatmap regression, while reusing components from nnU-Net's underlying self-configuration and training engine. nnLandmark achieves state-of-the-art performance across five public and one private dataset, benchmarked against three recently published methods. Its out-of-the-box usability enables training strong landmark detection models on new datasets without expert knowledge or dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning. Beyond accuracy, nnLandmark provides both a strong, common baseline and a flexible, standardized environment for developing and evaluating new methodological contributions. It further streamlines evaluation across multiple datasets by offering data conversion utilities for current public benchmarks. Together, these properties position nnLandmark as a central tool for advancing 3D medical landmark detection through systematic, transparent benchmarking, enabling to genuinely measure methodological progress.

      <title>Not All Pixels Are Equal: Confidence-Guided Attention for Feature Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-dense feature matching methods have been significantly advanced by leveraging attention mechanisms to extract discriminative descriptors. However, most existing approaches treat all pixels equally during attention computations, which can potentially introduce noise and redundancy from irrelevant regions. To address this issue, we propose a confidence-guided attention that adaptively prunes attention weights for each pixel based on precomputed matching confidence maps. These maps are generated by evaluating the mutual similarity between feature pairs extracted from the backbone, where high confidence indicates a high potential for matching. Then the attention is refined through two steps: (1) a confidence-guided bias is introduced to adaptively adjust the attention distributions for each query pixel, avoiding irrelevant interactions between non-overlap pixels; (2) the corresponding confidence map is additionally employed to rescale value features during feature aggregation, attenuating the influence of uncertain regions. Moreover, a classification loss is introduced to encourage the backbone's features to discriminate between matchable and non-matchable regions. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposal outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>U2-BENCH: Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models on Ultrasound Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17779v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrasound is a widely-used imaging modality critical to global healthcare, yet its interpretation remains challenging due to its varying image quality on operators, noises, and anatomical structures. Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal capabilities across natural and medical domains, their performance on ultrasound remains largely unexplored. We introduce U2-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate LVLMs on ultrasound understanding across classification, detection, regression, and text generation tasks. U2-BENCH aggregates 7,241 cases spanning 15 anatomical regions and defines 8 clinically inspired tasks, such as diagnosis, view recognition, lesion localization, clinical value estimation, and report generation, across 50 ultrasound application scenarios. We evaluate 23 state-of-the-art LVLMs, both open- and closed-source, general-purpose and medical-specific. Our results reveal strong performance on image-level classification, but persistent challenges in spatial reasoning and clinical language generation. U2-BENCH establishes a rigorous and unified testbed to assess and accelerate LVLM research in the uniquely multimodal domain of medical ultrasound imaging.</description>

      <title>Inverse Virtual Try-On: Generating Multi-Category Product-Style Images from Clothed Individuals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virtual try-on (VTON) has been widely explored for rendering garments onto person images, while its inverse task, virtual try-off (VTOFF), remains largely overlooked. VTOFF aims to recover standardized product images of garments directly from photos of clothed individuals. This capability is of great practical importance for e-commerce platforms, large-scale dataset curation, and the training of foundation models. Unlike VTON, which must handle diverse poses and styles, VTOFF naturally benefits from a consistent output format in the form of flat garment images. However, existing methods face two major limitations: (i) exclusive reliance on visual cues from a single photo often leads to ambiguity, and (ii) generated images usually suffer from loss of fine details, limiting their real-world applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce TEMU-VTOFF, a Text-Enhanced MUlti-category framework for VTOFF. Our architecture is built on a dual DiT-based backbone equipped with a multimodal attention mechanism that jointly exploits image, text, and mask information to resolve visual ambiguities and enable robust feature learning across garment categories. To explicitly mitigate detail degradation, we further design an alignment module that refines garment structures and textures, ensuring high-quality outputs. Extensive experiments on VITON-HD and Dress Code show that TEMU-VTOFF achieves new state-of-the-art performance, substantially improving both visual realism and consistency with target garments.</description>

      <title>SABER: Spatially Consistent 3D Universal Adversarial Objects for BEV Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adversarial robustness of BEV 3D object detectors is critical for autonomous driving (AD). Existing invasive attacks require altering the target vehicle itself (e.g. attaching patches), making them unrealistic and impractical for real-world evaluation. While non-invasive attacks that place adversarial objects in the environment are more practical, current methods still lack the multi-view and temporal consistency needed for physically plausible threats. In this paper, we present the first framework for generating universal, non-invasive, and 3D-consistent adversarial objects that expose fundamental vulnerabilities for BEV 3D object detectors. Instead of modifying target vehicles, our method inserts rendered objects into scenes with an occlusion-aware module that enforces physical plausibility across views and time. To maintain attack effectiveness across views and frames, we optimize adversarial object appearance using a BEV spatial feature-guided optimization strategy that attacks the detector's internal representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our learned universal adversarial objects can consistently degrade multiple BEV detectors from various viewpoints and distances. More importantly, the new environment-manipulation attack paradigm exposes models' over-reliance on contextual cues and provides a practical pipeline for robustness evaluation in AD systems.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models for Face Anti-Spoofing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) typically depends on a single visual modality when defending against presentation attacks such as print attacks, screen replays, and 3D masks, resulting in limited generalization across devices, environments, and attack types. Meanwhile, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved breakthroughs in image-text understanding and semantic reasoning, suggesting that integrating visual and linguistic co-inference into FAS can substantially improve both robustness and interpretability. However, the lack of a high-quality vision-language multimodal dataset has been a critical bottleneck. To address this, we introduce FaceCoT (Face Chain-of-Thought), the first large-scale Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset tailored for FAS. FaceCoT covers 14 spoofing attack types and enriches model learning with high-quality CoT VQA annotations. Meanwhile, we develop a caption model refined via reinforcement learning to expand the dataset and enhance annotation quality. Furthermore, we introduce a CoT-Enhanced Progressive Learning (CEPL) strategy to better leverage the CoT data and boost model performance on FAS tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained with FaceCoT and CEPL outperform state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>See-in-Pairs: Reference Image-Guided Comparative Vision-Language Models for Medical Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image diagnosis is challenging because many diseases resemble normal anatomy and exhibit substantial interpatient variability. Clinicians routinely rely on comparative diagnosis, such as referencing cross-patient healthy control images to identify subtle but clinically meaningful abnormalities. Although healthy reference images are abundant in practice, existing medical vision-language models (VLMs) primarily operate in a single-image or single-series setting and lack explicit mechanisms for comparative diagnosis. This work investigates whether incorporating clinically motivated comparison can enhance VLM performance. We show that providing VLMs with both a query image and a matched healthy reference image, accompanied by cross-patient comparative prompts, significantly improves diagnostic performance. This performance can be further augmented by lightweight supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a small amount of data. At the same time, we evaluate multiple strategies for selecting reference images, including random sampling, demographic attribute matching, embedding-based retrieval, and cross-center selection, and find consistently strong performance across all settings. Finally, we investigate why comparative diagnosis is effective theoretically, and observe improved sample efficiency and tighter alignment between visual and textual representations. Our findings highlight the clinical relevance of comparison-based diagnosis, provide practical strategies for incorporating reference images into VLMs, and demonstrate improved performance across diverse medical imaging tasks.</description>

      <title>Modulate and Reconstruct: Learning Hyperspectral Imaging from Misaligned Smartphone Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01835v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperspectral reconstruction (HSR) from RGB images is a highly promising direction for accurate color reproduction and material color measurement. While most existing approaches rely on a single RGB image - thereby limiting reconstruction accuracy - the majority of modern smartphones are equipped with two or more cameras. In this work, we propose a novel multi-image-to-hyperspectral reconstruction (MI-HSR) framework that leverages a triple-camera smartphone system, where two lenses are equipped with carefully selected spectral filters. Our easy-to-implement configuration, based on theoretical and empirical analysis, allows to obtain more complete and diverse spectral data than traditional single-chamber setups. To support this new paradigm, we introduce Doomer, the first dataset for MI-HSR, comprising aligned images from three smartphone cameras and a hyperspectral reference camera across diverse scenes. We further introduce a lightweight alignment module for MI-HSR that effectively fuses multi-view inputs while mitigating parallax- and occlusion-induced artifacts. Proposed module demonstrate consistent quality improvements for modern HSR methods. In a nutshell, our setup allows 30% more accurate estimations of spectra compared to an ordinary RGB camera, while the proposed alignment module boosts the reconstruction quality of SotA methods by an additional 5%. Our findings suggest that spectral filtering of multiple views with commodity hardware unlocks more accurate and practical hyperspectral imaging.</description>

      <title>Query-Based Adaptive Aggregation for Multi-Dataset Joint Training Toward Universal Visual Place Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03831v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning methods for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) have advanced significantly, largely driven by large-scale datasets. However, most existing approaches are trained on a single dataset, which can introduce dataset-specific inductive biases and limit model generalization. While multi-dataset joint training offers a promising solution for developing universal VPR models, divergences among training datasets can saturate the limited information capacity in feature aggregation layers, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose Query-based Adaptive Aggregation (QAA), a novel feature aggregation technique that leverages learned queries as reference codebooks to effectively enhance information capacity without significant computational or parameter complexity. We show that computing the Cross-query Similarity (CS) between query-level image features and reference codebooks provides a simple yet effective way to generate robust descriptors. Our results demonstrate that QAA outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving balanced generalization across diverse datasets while maintaining peak performance comparable to dataset-specific models. Ablation studies further explore QAA's mechanisms and scalability. Visualizations reveal that the learned queries exhibit diverse attention patterns across datasets.

      <title>Exploring Partial Multi-Label Learning via Integrating Semantic Co-occurrence Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial multi-label learning aims to extract knowledge from incompletely annotated data, which includes known correct labels, known incorrect labels, and unknown labels. The core challenge lies in accurately identifying the ambiguous relationships between labels and instances. In this paper, we emphasize that matching co-occurrence patterns between labels and instances is key to addressing this challenge. To this end, we propose Semantic Co-occurrence Insight Network (SCINet), a novel and effective framework for partial multi-label learning. Specifically, SCINet introduces a bi-dominant prompter module, which leverages an off-the-shelf multimodal model to capture text-image correlations and enhance semantic alignment. To reinforce instance-label interdependencies, we develop a cross-modality fusion module that jointly models inter-label correlations, inter-instance relationships, and co-occurrence patterns across instance-label assignments. Moreover, we propose an intrinsic semantic augmentation strategy that enhances the model's understanding of intrinsic data semantics by applying diverse image transformations, thereby fostering a synergistic relationship between label confidence and sample difficulty. Extensive experiments on four widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCINet surpasses state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present MoVieS, a Motion-aware View Synthesis model that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from monocular videos in one second. It represents dynamic 3D scenes with pixel-aligned Gaussian primitives and explicitly supervises their time-varying motions. This allows, for the first time, the unified modeling of appearance, geometry and motion from monocular videos, and enables reconstruction, view synthesis and 3D point tracking within a single learning-based framework. By bridging view synthesis with geometry reconstruction, MoVieS enables large-scale training on diverse datasets with minimal dependence on task-specific supervision. As a result, it also naturally supports a wide range of zero-shot applications, such as scene flow estimation and moving object segmentation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of MoVieS across multiple tasks, achieving competitive performance while offering several orders of magnitude speedups.</description>

      <title>Winsor-CAM: Human-Tunable Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Layer-Wise Winsorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpreting Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is critical for safety-sensitive applications such as healthcare and autonomous systems. Popular visual explanation methods like Grad-CAM use a single convolutional layer, potentially missing multi-scale cues and producing unstable saliency maps. We introduce Winsor-CAM, a single-pass gradient-based method that aggregates Grad-CAM maps from all convolutional layers and applies percentile-based Winsorization to attenuate outlier contributions. A user-controllable percentile parameter p enables semantic-level tuning from low-level textures to high-level object patterns. We evaluate Winsor-CAM on six CNN architectures using PASCAL VOC 2012 and PolypGen, comparing localization (IoU, center-of-mass distance) and fidelity (insertion/deletion AUC) against seven baselines including Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, LayerCAM, ScoreCAM, AblationCAM, ShapleyCAM, and FullGrad. On DenseNet121 with a subset of Pascal VOC 2012, Winsor-CAM achieves 46.8% IoU and 0.059 CoM distance versus 39.0% and 0.074 for Grad-CAM, with improved insertion AUC (0.656 vs. 0.623) and deletion AUC (0.197 vs. 0.242). Notably, even the worst-performing fixed p-value configuration outperforms FullGrad across all metrics. An ablation study confirms that incorporating earlier layers improves localization. Similar evaluation on PolypGen polyp segmentation further validates Winsor-CAM's effectiveness in medical imaging contexts. Winsor-CAM provides an efficient, robust, and human-tunable explanation tool for expert-in-the-loop analysis.</description>

      <title>LRR-Bench: Left, Right or Rotate? Vision-Language models Still Struggle With Spatial Understanding Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and humanoid robot manipulation, require precise spatial perception. However, it remains underexplored how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) recognize spatial relationships and perceive spatial movement. In this work, we introduce a spatial evaluation pipeline and construct a corresponding benchmark. Specifically, we categorize spatial understanding into two main types: absolute spatial understanding, which involves querying the absolute spatial position (e.g., left, right) of an object within an image, and 3D spatial understanding, which includes movement and rotation. Notably, our dataset is entirely synthetic, enabling the generation of test samples at a low cost while also preventing dataset contamination. We conduct experiments on multiple state-of-the-art VLMs and observe that there is significant room for improvement in their spatial understanding abilities. Explicitly, in our experiments, humans achieve near-perfect performance on all tasks, whereas current VLMs attain human-level performance only on the two simplest tasks. For the remaining tasks, the performance of VLMs is distinctly lower than that of humans. In fact, the best-performing Vision-Language Models even achieve near-zero scores on multiple tasks. The dataset and code are available on https://github.com/kong13661/LRR-Bench.</description>

      <title>Follow-Your-Shape: Shape-Aware Image Editing via Trajectory-Guided Region Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08134v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While recent flow-based image editing models demonstrate general-purpose capabilities across diverse tasks, they often struggle to specialize in challenging scenarios -- particularly those involving large-scale shape transformations. When performing such structural edits, these methods either fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120 new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape replacement.</description>

This project introduces a real-time assistive technology solution that leverages advanced deep learning techniques to translate sign language gestures into textual and audible speech. By employing convolution neural networks (CNN) trained on the Sign Language MNIST dataset, the system accurately classifies hand gestures captured live via webcam. Detected gestures are instantaneously translated into their corresponding meanings and transcribed into spoken language using text-to-speech synthesis, thus facilitating seamless communication. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate high model accuracy and robust real-time performance with some latency, highlighting the system's practical applicability as an accessible, reliable, and user-friendly tool for enhancing the autonomy and integration of sign language users in diverse social settings.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Multi-Modal Coding for High-Quality 3D Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds). Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.</description>

      <title>MOGS: Monocular Object-guided Gaussian Splatting in Large Scenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06685v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) deliver striking photorealism, and extending it to large scenes opens new opportunities for semantic reasoning and prediction in applications such as autonomous driving. Today's state-of-the-art systems for large scenes primarily originate from LiDAR-based pipelines that utilize long-range depth sensing. However, they require costly high-channel sensors whose dense point clouds strain memory and computation, limiting scalability, fleet deployment, and optimization speed. We present MOGS, a monocular 3DGS framework that replaces active LiDAR depth with object-anchored, metrized dense depth derived from sparse visual-inertial (VI) structure-from-motion (SfM) cues. Our key idea is to exploit image semantics to hypothesize per-object shape priors, anchor them with sparse but metrically reliable SfM points, and propagate the resulting metric constraints across each object to produce dense depth. To address two key challenges, i.e., insufficient SfM coverage within objects and cross-object geometric inconsistency, MOGS introduces (1) a multi-scale shape consensus module that adaptively merges small segments into coarse objects best supported by SfM and fits them with parametric shape models, and (2) a cross-object depth refinement module that optimizes per-pixel depth under a combinatorial objective combining geometric consistency, prior anchoring, and edge-aware smoothness. Experiments on public datasets show that, with a low-cost VI sensor suite, MOGS reduces training time by up to 30.4% and memory consumption by 19.8%, while achieving high-quality rendering competitive with costly LiDAR-based approaches in large scenes.</description>

      <title>Modelling and analysis of the 8 filters from the "master key filters hypothesis" for depthwise-separable deep networks in relation to idealized receptive fields based on scale-space theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the results of analysing and modelling a set of 8 ``master key filters'', which have been extracted by applying a clustering approach to the receptive fields learned in depthwise-separable deep networks based on the ConvNeXt architecture.
  For this purpose, we first compute spatial spread measures in terms of weighted mean values and weighted variances of the absolute values of the learned filters, which support the working hypotheses that: (i) the learned filters can be modelled by separable filtering operations over the spatial domain, and that (ii) the spatial offsets of the those learned filters that are non-centered are rather close to half a grid unit. Then, we model the clustered ``master key filters'' in terms of difference operators applied to a spatial smoothing operation in terms of the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, and demonstrate that the resulting idealized models of the receptive fields show good qualitative similarity to the learned filters.
  This modelling is performed in two different ways: (i) using possibly different values of the scale parameters in the coordinate directions for each filter, and (ii) using the same value of the scale parameter in both coordinate directions. Then, we perform the actual model fitting by either (i) requiring spatial spread measures in terms of spatial variances of the absolute values of the receptive fields to be equal, or (ii) minimizing the discrete $l_1$- or $l_2$-norms between the idealized receptive field models and the learned filters.
  Complementary experimental results then demonstrate the idealized models of receptive fields have good predictive properties for replacing the learned filters by idealized filters in depthwise-separable deep networks, thus showing that the learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be well approximated by discrete scale-space filters.</description>

      <title>RangeSAM: On the Potential of Visual Foundation Models for Range-View represented LiDAR segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15886v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point cloud segmentation is central to autonomous driving and 3D scene understanding. While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research due to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture fine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular memory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view methods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic segmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the rapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot recognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current state-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for LiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view. We present , to our knowledge, the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation, coupling efficient 2D feature extraction with standard projection/back-projection to operate on point clouds. To optimize SAM2 for range-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to the encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies inherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to the geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism in the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial patterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images. Our approach achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines. This work highlights the viability of VFMs as general-purpose backbones for 3D perception and opens a path toward unified, foundation-model-driven LiDAR segmentation. Results lets us conclude that range-view segmentation methods using VFMs leads to promising results.</description>

      <title>Comparing and Integrating Different Notions of Representational Correspondence in Neural Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21628v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extent to which different biological and artificial neural systems rely on equivalent internal representations to support similar tasks remains a central question in neuroscience and machine learning. Prior work typically compares systems using a single representational similarity metric, even though different metrics emphasize distinct facets of representational correspondence. Here we evaluate a suite of representational similarity measures by asking how well each metric recovers known structure across two domains: for artificial models, whether procedurally dissimilar models (differing in architecture or training paradigm) are assigned lower similarity than procedurally matched models; and for neural data, whether responses from distinct cortical regions are separated while responses from the same region align across subjects. Across both vision models and neural recordings, metrics that preserve representational geometry or tuning structure more reliably separate this structure than more flexible mappings such as linear predictivity. To integrate these complementary facets, we adapt Similarity Network Fusion, originally developed for multi-omics integration, to combine similarity graphs across metrics. The resulting fused similarity yields sharper separation of procedurally defined model families and, when applied to neural data, recovers a clearer hierarchical organization of the ventral visual stream that aligns more closely with established anatomical and functional hierarchies than single metrics. Overall, this approach reveals which dimensions of representational correspondence recover meaningful structure in models and brains, and how complementary notions of similarity can be integrated.</description>

      <title>WAVE: Learning Unified &amp; Versatile Audio-Visual Embeddings with Multimodal LLM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While embeddings from multimodal large language models (LLMs) excel as general-purpose representations, their application to dynamic modalities like audio and video remains underexplored. We introduce WAVE (\textbf{u}nified \&amp; \textbf{v}ersatile \textbf{a}udio-\textbf{v}isual \textbf{e}mbeddings), the first LLM-based embedding that creates a unified representation space for text, audio, and video modalities. WAVE employs a novel hierarchical feature fusion strategy and a joint multi-modal, multi-task training approach to enable two key capabilities: any-to-any cross-modal retrieval and the generation of prompt-aware embeddings tailored to user instructions. Experimentally, WAVE sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB-v2 video benchmark and achieves superior results in audio and video-to-audio retrieval. Its prompt-aware nature also yields remarkable performance in multimodal question answering, significantly outperforming existing embedding models. Ablation studies validate our joint training strategy, demonstrating improved performance across all modalities. With a newly introduced benchmark for versatile audio-visual learning, WAVE opens up broad possibilities for cross-modal, any-to-any applications. Our code and checkpoints are released at \href{https://github.com/TCL606/WAVE}{https://github.com/TCL606/WAVE}.</description>

      <title>CMT: Mid-Training for Efficient Learning of Consistency, Mean Flow, and Flow Map Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flow map models such as Consistency Models (CM) and Mean Flow (MF) enable few-step generation by learning the long jump of the ODE solution of diffusion models, yet training remains unstable, sensitive to hyperparameters, and costly. Initializing from a pre-trained diffusion model helps, but still requires converting infinitesimal steps into a long-jump map, leaving instability unresolved. We introduce mid-training, the first concept and practical method that inserts a lightweight intermediate stage between the (diffusion) pre-training and the final flow map training (i.e., post-training) for vision generation. Concretely, Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) is a compact and principled stage that trains a model to map points along a solver trajectory from a pre-trained model, starting from a prior sample, directly to the solver-generated clean sample. It yields a trajectory-consistent and stable initialization. This initializer outperforms random and diffusion-based baselines and enables fast, robust convergence without heuristics. Initializing post-training with CMT weights further simplifies flow map learning. Empirically, CMT achieves state of the art two step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10, 1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98% less training data and GPU time, compared to CMs. On ImageNet 256x256, CMT reaches 1-step FID 3.34 while cutting total training time by about 50% compared to MF from scratch (FID 3.43). This establishes CMT as a principled, efficient, and general framework for training flow map models.</description>

      <title>ZOO-Prune: Training-Free Token Pruning via Zeroth-Order Gradient Estimation in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable strong multimodal reasoning but incur heavy inference costs from redundant visual tokens. Token pruning alleviates this issue, yet existing approaches face limitations. Attention-based methods rely on raw attention scores, which are often unstable across layers and heads and can lead to redundant selections. Diversity-based methods improve robustness by selecting tokens far apart in feature space, but risk dropping regions needed for accurate prediction. We propose ZOO-Prune, a training-free framework built on the intuition that highly sensitive tokens have a stronger influence on the model's output and capture complementary visual cues rather than redundant ones. To achieve this, we estimate token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at the lightweight projection layer. This measures how small random perturbations affect the projected features and enables efficient approximation of each token's influence without backpropagation. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs and benchmarks show that ZOO-Prune consistently outperforms prior methods while pruning up to 94.4% of tokens without sacrificing accuracy. Our method also improves efficiency, reaching up to 2.30x faster end-to-end inference compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>AlignTok: Aligning Visual Foundation Encoders to Tokenizers for Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose aligning pretrained visual encoders to serve as tokenizers for latent diffusion models in image generation. Unlike training a variational autoencoder (VAE) from scratch, which primarily emphasizes low-level details, our approach leverages the rich semantic structure of foundation encoders. We introduce a three-stage alignment strategy called AlignTok: (1) freeze the encoder and train an adapter and a decoder to establish a semantic latent space; (2) jointly optimize all components with an additional semantic preservation loss, enabling the encoder to capture perceptual details while retaining high-level semantics; and (3) refine the decoder for improved reconstruction quality. This alignment yields semantically rich image tokenizers that benefit diffusion models. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, our tokenizer accelerates the convergence of diffusion models, reaching a gFID of 1.90 within just 64 epochs, and improves generation both with and without classifier-free guidance. Scaling to LAION, text-to-image models trained with our tokenizer consistently outperforms FLUX VAE and VA-VAE under the same training steps. Overall, our method is simple, scalable, and establishes a semantically grounded paradigm for continuous tokenizer design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA across eight benchmarks. Notably, our method obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED only using 4096D global descriptors. The code and model are available at https://github.com/chenshunpeng/SAGE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Flower, a solver for linear inverse problems. It leverages a pre-trained flow model to produce reconstructions that are consistent with the observed measurements. Flower operates through an iterative procedure over three steps: (i) a flow-consistent destination estimation, where the velocity network predicts a denoised target; (ii) a refinement step that projects the estimated destination onto a feasible set defined by the forward operator; and (iii) a time-progression step that re-projects the refined destination along the flow trajectory. We provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates how Flower approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, thereby unifying perspectives from plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers. On the practical side, Flower achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while using nearly identical hyperparameters across various linear inverse problems. Our code is available at https://github.com/mehrsapo/Flower.</description>

      <title>RewardMap: Tackling Sparse Rewards in Fine-grained Visual Reasoning via Multi-Stage Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning (RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover, models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6 benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding and reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>OBS-Diff: Accurate Pruning For Diffusion Models in One-Shot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, while powerful, suffer from prohibitive computational cost. Existing one-shot network pruning methods can hardly be directly applied to them due to the iterative denoising nature of diffusion models. To bridge the gap, this paper presents OBS-Diff, a novel one-shot pruning framework that enables accurate and training-free compression of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, (i) OBS-Diff revitalizes the classic Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS), adapting it to the complex architectures of modern diffusion models and supporting diverse pruning granularity, including unstructured, N:M semi-structured, and structured (MHA heads and FFN neurons) sparsity; (ii) To align the pruning criteria with the iterative dynamics of the diffusion process, by examining the problem from an error-accumulation perspective, we propose a novel timestep-aware Hessian construction that incorporates a logarithmic-decrease weighting scheme, assigning greater importance to earlier timesteps to mitigate potential error accumulation; (iii) Furthermore, a computationally efficient group-wise sequential pruning strategy is proposed to amortize the expensive calibration process. Extensive experiments show that OBS-Diff achieves state-of-the-art one-shot pruning for diffusion models, delivering inference acceleration with minimal degradation in visual quality.</description>

      <title>Efficient Discriminative Joint Encoders for Large Scale Vision-Language Reranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal retrieval still leans on embedding-based models like CLIP for fast vector search over pre-computed image embeddings. Yet, unlike text retrieval, where joint-encoder rerankers are standard, comparable vision-language rerankers are largely absent. We find that seminal joint encoders such as BLIP are severely bottlenecked by an expensive visual feature-extraction stage, preventing practical deployment at scale. Motivated by this bottleneck, we introduce EDJE, an Efficient Discriminative Joint Encoder that precomputes vision tokens offline and compresses them via a lightweight attention-based adapter, so online inference runs only a compact joint encoder over a small set of visual tokens plus the text. EDJE preserves strong retrieval performance while drastically reducing storage and online compute, enabling high-throughput inference. Specifically, EDJE processes 50k image--text pairs/second while requiring 49kB of disk storage per image, matching prior art on Flickr (zero-shot) and COCO (fine-tuned) retrieval.</description>

      <title>LinVideo: A Post-Training Framework towards O(n) Attention in Efficient Video Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis. However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.</description>

      <title>Action-Dynamics Modeling and Cross-Temporal Interaction for Online Action Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Action understanding, encompassing action detection and anticipation, plays a crucial role in numerous practical applications. However, untrimmed videos are often characterized by substantial redundant information and noise. Moreover, in modeling action understanding, the influence of the agent's intention on the action is often overlooked. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel framework called the State-Specific Model (SSM), designed to unify and enhance both action detection and anticipation tasks. In the proposed framework, the Critical State-Based Memory Compression module compresses frame sequences into critical states, reducing information redundancy. The Action Pattern Learning module constructs a state-transition graph with multi-dimensional edges to model action dynamics in complex scenarios, on the basis of which potential future cues can be generated to represent intention. Furthermore, our Cross-Temporal Interaction module models the mutual influence between intentions and past as well as current information through cross-temporal interactions, thereby refining present and future features and ultimately realizing simultaneous action detection and anticipation. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets -- including EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14, TVSeries, and the introduced Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset -- demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the importance of action dynamics learning and cross-temporal interactions, laying a foundation for future action understanding research.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Words -- Towards Native Vision-Language Primitives at Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The edifice of native Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has emerged as a rising contender to typical modular VLMs, shaped by evolving model architectures and training paradigms. Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread exploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs apart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-) How to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby accelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges and outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one native VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word representations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the strengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently embody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language encoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of native VLMs built from first principles, greatly narrowing the gap with top-tier modular counterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With 390M image-text examples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while mitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model crafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for scalable and powerful native VLM development, paired with a rich set of reusable components that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem. Our code and models are publicly available at: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/NEO.</description>

      <title>The Intricate Dance of Prompt Complexity, Quality, Diversity, and Consistency in T2I Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to motivate the difficulty of generalization with regard to prompt complexity and explain the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.</description>

      <title>MergeMix: A Unified Augmentation Paradigm for Visual and Multi-Modal Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language alignment in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL). To align multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in the post-training stage, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a stable choice but requires human annotations and lacks task generalizations, while Reinforcement Learning (RL) searches for better answers from reward signals but suffers from computational overhead and instability. To achieve balance among scalability, efficiency, and alignment generalizations, we propose MergeMix, a unified paradigm that bridges SFT and RL with an efficient Token Merge based Mixup augmentation. As for the Mixup policy, we generate contextual aligned mixed images with the corresponding labels according to the merged attention maps with cluster regions. Then, we enhance the preference-driven paradigm for MLLMs by building preference pairs with raw images and MergeMix-generated ones and optimizing the soft preference margin with the mixed SimPO loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MergeMix not only achieves dominant classification accuracy as an augmentation method but also improves generalization abilities and alignment of MLLMs, providing a new learning paradigm for preference alignment with training efficiency and stability.</description>

      <title>SYNAPSE-Net: A Unified Framework with Lesion-Aware Hierarchical Gating for Robust Segmentation of Heterogeneous Brain Lesions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic segmentation of diverse heterogeneous brain lesions using multi-modal MRI is a challenging problem in clinical neuroimaging, mainly because of the lack of generalizability and high prediction variance of pathology-specific deep learning models. In this work, we propose a unified and adaptive multi-stream framework called SYNAPSE-Net to perform robust multi-pathology segmentation with reduced performance variance. The framework is based on multi-stream convolutional encoders with global context modeling and a cross-modal attention fusion strategy to ensure stable and effective multi-modal feature integration. It also employs a variance-aware training strategy to enhance the robustness of the network across diverse tasks. The framework is extensively validated using three public challenge datasets: WMH MICCAI 2017, ISLES 2022, and BraTS 2020. The results show consistent improvements in boundary accuracy, delineation quality, and stability across diverse pathologies. This proposed framework achieved a high Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.831 and a low Hausdorff distance at the 95th percentile (HD95) of 3.03 on the WMH MICCAI 2017 dataset. It also achieved the lowest HD95 of 9.69 on the ISLES 2022 dataset and the highest tumor core DSC of 0.8651 on the BraTS 2020 dataset. These results validate the robustness of the proposed framework in providing a clinically relevant computer-aided solution for automated brain lesion segmentation.

      <title>Countering Multi-modal Representation Collapse through Rank-targeted Fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-modal fusion methods often suffer from two types of representation collapse: feature collapse where individual dimensions lose their discriminative power (as measured by eigenspectra), and modality collapse where one dominant modality overwhelms the other. Applications like human action anticipation that require fusing multifarious sensor data are hindered by both feature and modality collapse. However, existing methods attempt to counter feature collapse and modality collapse separately. This is because there is no unifying framework that efficiently addresses feature and modality collapse in conjunction. In this paper, we posit the utility of effective rank as an informative measure that can be utilized to quantify and counter both the representation collapses. We propose \textit{Rank-enhancing Token Fuser}, a theoretically grounded fusion framework that selectively blends less informative features from one modality with complementary features from another modality. We show that our method increases the effective rank of the fused representation. To address modality collapse, we evaluate modality combinations that mutually increase each others' effective rank. We show that depth maintains representational balance when fused with RGB, avoiding modality collapse. We validate our method on action anticipation, where we present \texttt{R3D}, a depth-informed fusion framework. Extensive experiments on NTURGBD, UTKinect, and DARai demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by up to 3.74\%.

Abstract: Generative models are reshaping the live-streaming industry by redefining how content is created, styled, and delivered. Previous image-based streaming diffusion models have powered efficient and creative live streaming products but have hit limits on temporal consistency due to the foundation of image-based designs. Recent advances in video diffusion have markedly improved temporal consistency and sampling efficiency for offline generation. However, offline generation systems primarily optimize throughput by batching large workloads. In contrast, live online streaming operates under strict service-level objectives (SLOs): time-to-first-frame must be minimal, and every frame must meet a per-frame deadline with low jitter. Besides, scalable multi-GPU serving for real-time streams remains largely unresolved so far. To address this, we present StreamDiffusionV2, a training-free pipeline for interactive live streaming with video diffusion models. StreamDiffusionV2 integrates an SLO-aware batching scheduler and a block scheduler, together with a sink-token--guided rolling KV cache, a motion-aware noise controller, and other system-level optimizations. Moreover, we introduce a scalable pipeline orchestration that parallelizes the diffusion process across denoising steps and network layers, achieving near-linear FPS scaling without violating latency guarantees. The system scales seamlessly across heterogeneous GPU environments and supports flexible denoising steps (e.g., 1--4), enabling both ultra-low-latency and higher-quality modes. Without TensorRT or quantization, StreamDiffusionV2 renders the first frame within 0.5s and attains 58.28 FPS with a 14B-parameter model and 64.52 FPS with a 1.3B-parameter model on four H100 GPUs, making state-of-the-art generative live streaming practical and accessible--from individual creators to enterprise-scale platforms.</description>

Abstract: Embodied navigation is a fundamental capability for robotic agents operating. Real-world deployment requires open vocabulary generalization and low training overhead, motivating zero-shot methods rather than task-specific RL training. However, existing zero-shot methods that build explicit 3D scene graphs often compress rich visual observations into text-only relations, leading to high construction cost, irreversible loss of visual evidence, and constrained vocabularies. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multi-modal 3D Scene Graph (M3DSG), which preserves visual cues by replacing textual relation</description>

      <title>MoDES: Accelerating Mixture-of-Experts Multimodal Large Language Models via Dynamic Expert Skipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks, but they suffer from high computational inefficiency. To reduce inference overhead, expert skipping methods have been proposed to deactivate redundant experts based on the current input tokens. However, we find that applying these methods-originally designed for unimodal large language models (LLMs)-to MLLMs results in considerable performance degradation. This is primarily because such methods fail to account for the heterogeneous contributions of experts across MoE layers and modality-specific behaviors of tokens within these layers. Motivated by these findings, we propose MoDES, the first training-free framework that adaptively skips experts to enable efficient and accurate MoE MLLM inference. It incorporates a globally-modulated local gating (GMLG) mechanism that integrates global layer-wise importance into local routing probabilities to accurately estimate per-token expert importance. A dual-modality thresholding (DMT) method is then applied, which processes tokens from each modality separately, to derive the skipping schedule. To set the optimal thresholds, we introduce a frontier search algorithm that exploits monotonicity properties, cutting convergence time from several days to a few hours. Extensive experiments for 3 model series across 13 benchmarks demonstrate that MoDES far outperforms previous approaches. For instance, when skipping 88% experts for Qwen3-VL-MoE-30B-A3B-Instruct, the performance boost is up to 10.67% (97.33% vs. 86.66%). Furthermore, MoDES significantly enhances inference speed, improving the prefilling time by 2.16$\times$ and the decoding time by 1.26$\times$.

      <title>Mantis: A Versatile Vision-Language-Action Model with Disentangled Visual Foresight</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate that visual signals can effectively complement sparse action supervisions. However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $\pi_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability. Code and weights are released to support the open-source community.</description>

      <title>GuideFlow: Constraint-Guided Flow Matching for Planning in End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Driving planning is a critical component of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving. However, prevailing Imitative E2E Planners often suffer from multimodal trajectory mode collapse, failing to produce diverse trajectory proposals. Meanwhile, Generative E2E Planners struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization stage to refine their outputs. In this paper, we propose \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}}, a novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely, \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}} explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning signals. Our core contribution lies in directly enforcing explicit constraints within the flow matching generation process, rather than relying on implicit constraint encoding. Crucially, \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}} unifies the training of the flow matching with the Energy-Based Model (EBM) to enhance the model's autonomous optimization capability to robustly satisfy physical constraints. Secondly, \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}} parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style.

      <title>MapReduce LoRA: Advancing the Pareto Front in Multi-Preference Optimization for Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20629v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) with reward models has advanced alignment of generative models to human aesthetic and perceptual preferences. However, jointly optimizing multiple rewards often incurs an alignment tax, improving one dimension while degrading others. To address this, we introduce two complementary methods: MapReduce LoRA and Reward-aware Token Embedding (RaTE). MapReduce LoRA trains preference-specific LoRA experts in parallel and iteratively merges them to refine a shared base model; RaTE learns reward-specific token embeddings that compose at inference for flexible preference control. Experiments on Text-to-Image generation (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX.1-dev) show improvements of 36.1%, 4.6%, and 55.7%, and 32.7%, 4.3%, and 67.1% on GenEval, PickScore, and OCR, respectively. On Text-to-Video generation (HunyuanVideo), visual and motion quality improve by 48.1% and 90.0%, respectively. On the language task, Helpful Assistant, with Llama-2 7B, helpful and harmless improve by 43.4% and 136.7%, respectively. Our framework sets a new state-of-the-art multi-preference alignment recipe across modalities.</description>

      <title>LocateAnything3D: Vision-Language 3D Detection with Chain-of-Sight</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To act in the world, a model must name what it sees and know where it is in 3D. Today's vision-language models (VLMs) excel at open-ended 2D description and grounding, yet multi-object 3D detection remains largely missing from the VLM toolbox. We present LocateAnything3D, a VLM-native recipe that casts 3D detection as a next-token prediction problem. The key is a short, explicit Chain-of-Sight (CoS) sequence that mirrors how human reason from images: find an object in 2D, then infer its distance, size, and pose. The decoder first emits 2D detections as a visual chain-of-thought, then predicts 3D boxes under an easy-to-hard curriculum: across objects, a near-to-far order reduces early ambiguity and matches ego-centric utility; within each object, a center-from-camera, dimensions, and rotation factorization ranks information by stability and learnability. This VLM-native interface preserves open-vocabulary and visual-prompting capability without specialized heads. On the challenging Omni3D benchmark, our model achieves state-of-the-art results, with 38.90 AP_3D, surpassing the previous best by +13.98 absolute improvement even when the baseline is given ground-truth 2D boxes. It also generalizes zero-shot to held-out categories with strong robustness. By turning 3D detection into a disciplined next-token problem, LocateAnything3D offers a practical foundation for models to perceive in 3D.</description>

      <title>VLM-Pruner: Buffering for Spatial Sparsity in an Efficient VLM Centrifugal Token Pruning Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image understanding tasks, but the large number of visual tokens imposes significant computational costs, hindering deployment on mobile devices. Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate that VLM-Pruner consistently outperforms strong baselines across five VLMs with an 88.9\% pruning rate, while delivering an end-to-end inference speedup. The code is available at https://github.com/Casey-bit/VLMPruner.</description>

      <title>Generative Neural Video Compression via Video Diffusion Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present GNVC-VD, the first DiT-based generative neural video compression framework built upon an advanced video generation foundation model, where spatio-temporal latent compression and sequence-level generative refinement are unified within a single codec. Existing perceptual codecs primarily rely on pre-trained image generative priors to restore high-frequency details, but their frame-wise nature lacks temporal modeling and inevitably leads to perceptual flickering. To address this, GNVC-VD introduces a unified flow-matching latent refinement module that leverages a video diffusion transformer to jointly enhance intra- and inter-frame latents through sequence-level denoising, ensuring consistent spatio-temporal details. Instead of denoising from pure Gaussian noise as in video generation, GNVC-VD initializes refinement from decoded spatio-temporal latents and learns a correction term that adapts the diffusion prior to compression-induced degradation. A conditioning adaptor further injects compression-aware cues into intermediate DiT layers, enabling effective artifact removal while maintaining temporal coherence under extreme bitrate constraints. Extensive experiments show that GNVC-VD surpasses both traditional and learned codecs in perceptual quality and significantly reduces the flickering artifacts that persist in prior generative approaches, even below 0.01 bpp, highlighting the promise of integrating video-native generative priors into neural codecs for next-generation perceptual video compression.</description>

      <title>MedDIFT: Multi-Scale Diffusion-Based Correspondence in 3D Medical Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate spatial correspondence between medical images is essential for longitudinal analysis, lesion tracking, and image-guided interventions. Medical image registration methods rely on local intensity-based similarity measures, which fail to capture global semantic structure and often yield mismatches in low-contrast or anatomically variable regions. Recent advances in diffusion models suggest that their intermediate representations encode rich geometric and semantic information. We present MedDIFT, a training-free 3D correspondence framework that leverages multi-scale features from a pretrained latent medical diffusion model as voxel descriptors. MedDIFT fuses diffusion activations into rich voxel-wise descriptors and matches them via cosine similarity, with an optional local-search prior. On a publicly available lung CT dataset, MedDIFT shows promising capability in identifying anatomical correspondence without requiring any task-specific model training. Ablation experiments confirm that multi-level feature fusion and modest diffusion noise improve performance. Code is available online.</description>

      <title>A Conditional Generative Framework for Synthetic Data Augmentation in Segmenting Thin and Elongated Structures in Biological Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thin and elongated filamentous structures, such as microtubules and actin filaments, often play important roles in biological systems. Segmenting these filaments in biological images is a fundamental step for quantitative analysis. Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the performance of filament segmentation. However, there is a big challenge in acquiring high quality pixel-level annotated dataset for filamentous structures, as the dense distribution and geometric properties of filaments making manual annotation extremely laborious and time-consuming. To address the data shortage problem, we propose a conditional generative framework based on the Pix2Pix architecture to generate realistic filaments in microscopy images from binary masks. We also propose a filament-aware structural loss to improve the structure similarity when generating synthetic images. Our experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach and outperformed existing model trained without synthetic data.</description>

      <title>CheXmask-U: Quantifying uncertainty in landmark-based anatomical segmentation for X-ray images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study uncertainty estimation for anatomical landmark-based segmentation on chest X-rays. Inspired by hybrid neural network architectures that combine standard image convolutional encoders with graph-based generative decoders, and leveraging their variational latent space, we derive two complementary measures: (i) latent uncertainty, captured directly from the learned distribution parameters, and (ii) predictive uncertainty, obtained by generating multiple stochastic output predictions from latent samples. Through controlled corruption experiments we show that both uncertainty measures increase with perturbation severity, reflecting both global and local degradation. We demonstrate that these uncertainty signals can identify unreliable predictions by comparing with manual ground-truth, and support out-of-distribution detection on the CheXmask dataset. More importantly, we release CheXmask-U (huggingface.co/datasets/mcosarinsky/CheXmask-U), a large scale dataset of 657,566 chest X-ray landmark segmentations with per-node uncertainty estimates, enabling researchers to account for spatial variations in segmentation quality when using these anatomical masks. Our findings establish uncertainty estimation as a promising direction to enhance robustness and safe deployment of landmark-based anatomical segmentation methods in chest X-ray. A fully working interactive demo of the method is available at huggingface.co/spaces/matiasky/CheXmask-U and the source code at github.com/mcosarinsky/CheXmask-U.</description>

      <title>MRD: Using Physically Based Differentiable Rendering to Probe Vision Models for 3D Scene Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12307v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved impressive success in many vision benchmarks, it remains difficult to understand and explain the representations and decisions of these models. Though vision models are typically trained on 2D inputs, they are often assumed to develop an implicit representation of the underlying 3D scene (for example, showing tolerance to partial occlusion, or the ability to reason about relative depth). Here, we introduce MRD (metamers rendered differentiably), an approach that uses physically based differentiable rendering to probe vision models' implicit understanding of generative 3D scene properties, by finding 3D scene parameters that are physically different but produce the same model activation (i.e. are model metamers). Unlike previous pixel-based methods for evaluating model representations, these reconstruction results are always grounded in physical scene descriptions. This means we can, for example, probe a model's sensitivity to object shape while holding material and lighting constant. As a proof-of-principle, we assess multiple models in their ability to recover scene parameters of geometry (shape) and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (material). The results show high similarity in model activation between target and optimized scenes, with varying visual results. Qualitatively, these reconstructions help investigate the physical scene attributes to which models are sensitive or invariant. MRD holds promise for advancing our understanding of both computer and human vision by enabling analysis of how physical scene parameters drive changes in model responses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image classifiers detect gastrointestinal diseases well, but they do not explain their decisions. Large language models can generate clinical text, yet they struggle with visual reasoning and often produce unstable or incorrect explanations. This leaves a gap between what a model sees and the type of reasoning a clinician expects. We introduce a framework that links image classification with structured clinical reasoning. A new hybrid model, MobileCoAtNet, is designed for endoscopic images and achieves high accuracy across eight stomach-related classes. Its outputs are then used to drive reasoning by several LLMs. To judge this reasoning, we build two expert-verified benchmarks covering causes, symptoms, treatment, lifestyle, and follow-up care. Thirty-two LLMs are evaluated against these gold standards. Strong classification improves the quality of their explanations, but none of the models reach human-level stability. Even the best LLMs change their reasoning when prompts vary. Our study shows that combining DL with LLMs can produce useful clinical narratives, but current LLMs remain unreliable for high-stakes medical decisions. The framework provides a clearer view of their limits and a path for building safer reasoning systems. The complete source code and datasets used in this study are available at https://github.com/souravbasakshuvo/DL3M.</description>

      <title>Foundation Model Priors Enhance Object Focus in Feature Space for Source-Free Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art approaches in Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) typically rely on Mean-Teacher self-labeling. However, domain shift often reduces the detector's ability to maintain strong object-focused representations, causing high-confidence activations over background clutter. This weak object focus results in unreliable pseudo-labels from the detection head. While prior works mainly refine these pseudo-labels, they overlook the underlying need to strengthen the feature space itself. We propose FALCON-SFOD (Foundation-Aligned Learning with Clutter suppression and Noise robustness), a framework designed to enhance object-focused adaptation under domain shift. It consists of two complementary components. SPAR (Spatial Prior-Aware Regularization) leverages the generalization strength of vision foundation models to regularize the detector's feature space. Using class-agnostic binary masks derived from OV-SAM, SPAR promotes structured and foreground-focused activations by guiding the network toward object regions. IRPL (Imbalance-aware Noise Robust Pseudo-Labeling) complements SPAR by promoting balanced and noise-tolerant learning under severe foreground-background imbalance. Guided by a theoretical analysis that connects these designs to tighter localization and classification error bounds, FALCON-SFOD achieves competitive performance across SFOD benchmarks.</description>

      <title>REVEALER: Reinforcement-Guided Visual Reasoning for Element-Level Text-Image Alignment Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating the alignment between textual prompts and generated images is critical for ensuring the reliability and usability of text-to-image (T2I) models. However, most existing evaluation methods rely on coarse-grained metrics or static QA pipelines, which lack fine-grained interpretability and struggle to reflect human preferences. To address this, we propose REVEALER, a unified framework for element-level alignment evaluation based on reinforcement-guided visual reasoning. Adopting a structured "grounding-reasoning-conclusion" paradigm, our method enables Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to explicitly localize semantic elements and derive interpretable alignment judgments. We optimize the model via Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO) using a composite reward function that incorporates structural format, grounding accuracy, and alignment fidelity. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks-EvalMuse-40K, RichHF, MHaluBench, and GenAI-Bench-demonstrate that REVEALER achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our approach consistently outperforms both strong proprietary models and supervised baselines while demonstrating superior inference efficiency compared to existing iterative visual reasoning methods.</description>

      <title>Object-WIPER : Training-Free Object and Associated Effect Removal in Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Object-WIPER, a training-free framework for removing dynamic objects and their associated visual effects from videos, and inpainting them with semantically consistent and temporally coherent content. Our approach leverages a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion transformer (DiT). Given an input video, a user-provided object mask, and query tokens describing the target object and its effects, we localize relevant visual tokens via visual-text cross-attention and visual self-attention. This produces an intermediate effect mask that we fuse with the user mask to obtain a final foreground token mask to replace. We first invert the video through the DiT to obtain structured noise, then reinitialize the masked tokens with Gaussian noise while preserving background tokens. During denoising, we copy values for the background tokens saved during inversion to maintain scene fidelity. To address the lack of suitable evaluation, we introduce a new object removal metric that rewards temporal consistency among foreground tokens across consecutive frames, coherence between foreground and background tokens within each frame, and dissimilarity between the input and output foreground tokens. Experiments on DAVIS and a newly curated real-world associated effect benchmark (WIPER-Bench) show that Object-WIPER surpasses both training-based and training-free baselines in terms of the metric, achieving clean removal and temporally stable reconstruction without any retraining. Our new benchmark, source code, and pre-trained models will be publicly available.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present LookBench (We use the term "look" to reflect retrieval that mirrors how people shop -- finding the exact item, a close substitute, or a visually consistent alternative.), a live, holistic and challenging benchmark for fashion image retrieval in real e-commerce settings. LookBench includes both recent product images sourced from live websites and AI-generated fashion images, reflecting contemporary trends and use cases. Each test sample is time-stamped and we intend to update the benchmark periodically, enabling contamination-aware evaluation aligned with declared training cutoffs. Grounded in our fine-grained attribute taxonomy, LookBench covers single-item and outfit-level retrieval across. Our experiments reveal that LookBench poses a significant challenge on strong baselines, with many models achieving below $60\%$ Recall@1. Our proprietary model achieves the best performance on LookBench, and we release an open-source counterpart that ranks second, with both models attaining state-of-the-art results on legacy Fashion200K evaluations. LookBench is designed to be updated semi-annually with new test samples and progressively harder task variants, providing a durable measure of progress. We publicly release our leaderboard, dataset, evaluation code, and trained models.</description>

Abstract: Discrete video VAEs underpin modern text-to-video generation and video understanding systems, yet existing tokenizers typically learn visual codebooks at a single scale with limited vocabularies and shallow language supervision, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and zero-shot transfer. We introduce PyraTok, a language-aligned pyramidal tokenizer that learns semantically structured discrete latents across multiple spatiotemporal resolutions. PyraTok builds on a pretrained video VAE and a novel Language aligned Pyramidal Quantization (LaPQ) module that discretizes encoder features at several depths using a shared large binary codebook, yielding compact yet expressive video token sequences. To tightly couple visual tokens with language, PyraTok jointly optimizes multi-scale text-guided quantization and a global autoregressive objective over the token hierarchy. Across ten benchmarks, PyraTok delivers state-of-the-art (SOTA) video reconstruction, consistently improves text-to-video quality, and sets new SOTA zero-shot performance on video segmentation, temporal action localization, and video understanding, scaling robustly to up to 4K/8K resolutions.</description>

      <title>Emotion-LLaMAv2 and MMEVerse: A New Framework and Benchmark for Multimodal Emotion Understanding</title>

Abstract: Understanding human emotions from multimodal signals poses a significant challenge in affective computing and human-robot interaction. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have excelled in general vision-language tasks, their capabilities in emotional reasoning remain limited. The field currently suffers from a scarcity of large-scale datasets with high-quality, descriptive emotion annotations and lacks standardized benchmarks for evaluation. Our preliminary framework, Emotion-LLaMA, pioneered instruction-tuned multimodal learning for emotion reasoning but was restricted by explicit face detectors, implicit fusion strategies, and low-quality training data with limited scale. To address these limitations, we present Emotion-LLaMAv2 and the MMEVerse benchmark, establishing an end-to-end pipeline together with a standardized evaluation setting for emotion recognition and reasoning. Emotion-LLaMAv2 introduces three key advances. First, an end-to-end multiview encoder eliminates external face detection and captures nuanced emotional cues via richer spatial and temporal multiview tokens. Second, a Conv Attention pre-fusion module is designed to enable simultaneous local and global multimodal feature interactions external to the LLM backbone. Third, a perception-to-cognition curriculum instruction tuning scheme within the LLaMA2 backbone unifies emotion recognition and free-form emotion reasoning. To support large-scale training and reproducible evaluation, MMEVerse aggregates twelve publicly available emotion datasets, including IEMOCAP, MELD, DFEW, and MAFW, into a unified multimodal instruction format. The data are re-annotated via a multi-agent pipeline involving Qwen2 Audio, Qwen2.5 VL, and GPT 4o, producing 130k training clips and 36k testing clips across 18 evaluation benchmarks.</description>

      <title>FineVAU: A Novel Human-Aligned Benchmark for Fine-Grained Video Anomaly Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU) is a novel task focused on describing unusual occurrences in videos. Despite growing interest, the evaluation of VAU remains an open challenge. Existing benchmarks rely on n-gram-based metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE-L) or LLM-based evaluation. The first fails to capture the rich, free-form, and visually grounded nature of LVLM responses, while the latter focuses on assessing language quality over factual relevance, often resulting in subjective judgments that are misaligned with human perception. In this work, we address this issue by proposing FineVAU, a new benchmark for VAU that shifts the focus towards rich, fine-grained and domain-specific understanding of anomalous videos. We formulate VAU as a three-fold problem, with the goal of comprehensively understanding key descriptive elements of anomalies in video: events (What), participating entities (Who) and location (Where). Our benchmark introduces a) FVScore, a novel, human-aligned evaluation metric that assesses the presence of critical visual elements in LVLM answers, providing interpretable, fine-grained feedback; and b) FineW3, a novel, comprehensive dataset curated through a structured and fully automatic procedure that augments existing human annotations with high quality, fine-grained visual information. Human evaluation reveals that our proposed metric has a superior alignment with human perception of anomalies in comparison to current approaches. Detailed experiments on FineVAU unveil critical limitations in LVLM's ability to perceive anomalous events that require spatial and fine-grained temporal understanding, despite strong performance on coarse grain, static information, and events with strong visual cues.</description>

      <title>AGE-Net: Spectral--Spatial Fusion and Anatomical Graph Reasoning with Evidential Ordinal Regression for Knee Osteoarthritis Grading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated Kellgren--Lawrence (KL) grading from knee radiographs is challenging due to subtle structural changes, long-range anatomical dependencies, and ambiguity near grade boundaries. We propose AGE-Net, a ConvNeXt-based framework that integrates Spectral--Spatial Fusion (SSF), Anatomical Graph Reasoning (AGR), and Differential Refinement (DFR). To capture predictive uncertainty and preserve label ordinality, AGE-Net employs a Normal-Inverse-Gamma (NIG) evidential regression head and a pairwise ordinal ranking constraint. On a knee KL dataset, AGE-Net achieves a quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) of 0.9017 +/- 0.0045 and a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.2349 +/- 0.0028 over three random seeds, outperforming strong CNN baselines and showing consistent gains in ablation studies. We further outline evaluations of uncertainty quality, robustness, and explainability, with additional experimental figures to be included in the full manuscript.</description>

      <title>PocketGS: On-Device Training of 3D Gaussian Splatting for High Perceptual Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient and high-fidelity 3D scene modeling is a long-standing pursuit in computer graphics. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods achieve impressive real-time modeling performance, they rely on resource-unconstrained training assumptions that fail on mobile devices, which are limited by minute-scale training budgets and hardware-available peak-memory. We present PocketGS, a mobile scene modeling paradigm that enables on-device 3DGS training under these tightly coupled constraints while preserving high perceptual fidelity. Our method resolves the fundamental contradictions of standard 3DGS through three co-designed operators: G builds geometry-faithful point-cloud priors; I injects local surface statistics to seed anisotropic Gaussians, thereby reducing early conditioning gaps; and T unrolls alpha compositing with cached intermediates and index-mapped gradient scattering for stable mobile backpropagation. Collectively, these operators satisfy the competing requirements of training efficiency, memory compactness, and modeling fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PocketGS is able to outperform the powerful mainstream workstation 3DGS baseline to deliver high-quality reconstructions, enabling a fully on-device, practical capture-to-rendering workflow.</description>

      <title>Inference-Time Dynamic Modality Selection for Incomplete Multimodal Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal deep learning (MDL) has achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet its practical deployment is often hindered by incomplete multimodal data. Existing incomplete MDL methods either discard missing modalities, risking the loss of valuable task-relevant information, or recover them, potentially introducing irrelevant noise, leading to the discarding-imputation dilemma. To address this dilemma, in this paper, we propose DyMo, a new inference-time dynamic modality selection framework that adaptively identifies and integrates reliable recovered modalities, fully exploring task-relevant information beyond the conventional discard-or-impute paradigm. Central to DyMo is a novel selection algorithm that maximizes multimodal task-relevant information for each test sample. Since direct estimation of such information at test time is intractable due to the unknown data distribution, we theoretically establish a connection between information and the task loss, which we compute at inference time as a tractable proxy. Building on this, a novel principled reward function is proposed to guide modality selection. In addition, we design a flexible multimodal network architecture compatible with arbitrary modality combinations, alongside a tailored training strategy for robust representation learning. Extensive experiments on diverse natural and medical image datasets show that DyMo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art incomplete/dynamic MDL methods across various missing-data scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com//siyi-wind/DyMo.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Purification and Fusion for Small-Object RGB-D Transmission-Line Defect Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01696v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transmission line defect detection remains challenging for automated UAV inspection due to the dominance of small-scale defects, complex backgrounds, and illumination variations. Existing RGB-based detectors, despite recent progress, struggle to distinguish geometrically subtle defects from visually similar background structures under limited chromatic contrast. This paper proposes CMAFNet, a Cross-Modal Alignment and Fusion Network that integrates RGB appearance and depth geometry through a principled purify-then-fuse paradigm. CMAFNet consists of a Semantic Recomposition Module that performs dictionary-based feature purification via a learned codebook to suppress modality-specific noise while preserving defect-discriminative information, and a Contextual Semantic Integration Framework that captures global spatial dependencies using partial-channel attention to enhance structural semantic reasoning. Position-wise normalization within the purification stage enforces explicit reconstruction-driven cross-modal alignment, ensuring statistical compatibility between heterogeneous features prior to fusion. Extensive experiments on the TLRGBD benchmark, where 94.5% of instances are small objects, demonstrate that CMAFNet achieves 32.2% mAP@50 and 12.5% APs, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8 and 4.0 percentage points, respectively. A lightweight variant reaches 24.8% mAP50 at 228 FPS with only 4.9M parameters, surpassing all YOLO-based detectors while matching transformer-based methods at substantially lower computational cost.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Aware Rotary Position Embedding for Consistent Video World Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predictive world models that simulate future observations under explicit camera control are fundamental to interactive AI. Despite rapid advances, current systems lack spatial persistence: they fail to maintain stable scene structures over long trajectories, frequently hallucinating details when cameras revisit previously observed locations. We identify that this geometric drift stems from reliance on screen-space positional embeddings, which conflict with the projective geometry required for 3D consistency. We introduce \textbf{ViewRope}, a geometry-aware encoding that injects camera-ray directions directly into video transformer self-attention layers. By parameterizing attention with relative ray geometry rather than pixel locality, ViewRope provides a model-native inductive bias for retrieving 3D-consistent content across temporal gaps. We further propose \textbf{Geometry-Aware Frame-Sparse Attention}, which exploits these geometric cues to selectively attend to relevant historical frames, improving efficiency without sacrificing memory consistency. We also present \textbf{ViewBench}, a diagnostic suite measuring loop-closure fidelity and geometric drift. Our results demonstrate that ViewRope substantially improves long-term consistency while reducing computational costs.</description>

      <title>GOT-Edit: Geometry-Aware Generic Object Tracking via Online Model Editing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human perception for effective object tracking in a 2D video stream arises from the implicit use of prior 3D knowledge combined with semantic reasoning. In contrast, most generic object tracking (GOT) methods primarily rely on 2D features of the target and its surroundings while neglecting 3D geometric cues, which makes them susceptible to partial occlusion, distractors, and variations in geometry and appearance. To address this limitation, we introduce GOT-Edit, an online cross-modality model editing approach that integrates geometry-aware cues into a generic object tracker from a 2D video stream. Our approach leverages features from a pre-trained Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer to enable geometric cue inference from only a few 2D images. To tackle the challenge of seamlessly combining geometry and semantics, GOT-Edit performs online model editing with null-space constrained updates that incorporate geometric information while preserving semantic discrimination, yielding consistently better performance across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple GOT benchmarks demonstrate that GOT-Edit achieves superior robustness and accuracy, particularly under occlusion and clutter, establishing a new paradigm for combining 2D semantics with 3D geometric reasoning for generic object tracking.</description>

      <title>Agent Banana: High-Fidelity Image Editing with Agentic Thinking and Tooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study instruction-based image editing under professional workflows and identify three persistent challenges: (i) editors often over-edit, modifying content beyond the user's intent; (ii) existing models are largely single-turn, while multi-turn edits can alter object faithfulness; and (iii) evaluation at around 1K resolution is misaligned with real workflows that often operate on ultra high-definition images (e.g., 4K). We propose Agent Banana, a hierarchical agentic planner-executor framework for high-fidelity, object-aware, deliberative editing. Agent Banana introduces two key mechanisms: (1) Context Folding, which compresses long interaction histories into structured memory for stable long-horizon control; and (2) Image Layer Decomposition, which performs localized layer-based edits to preserve non-target regions while enabling native-resolution outputs. To support rigorous evaluation, we build HDD-Bench, a high-definition, dialogue-based benchmark featuring verifiable stepwise targets and native 4K images (11.8M pixels) for diagnosing long-horizon failures. On HDD-Bench, Agent Banana achieves the best multi-turn consistency and background fidelity (e.g., IC 0.871, SSIM-OM 0.84, LPIPS-OM 0.12) while remaining competitive on instruction following, and also attains strong performance on standard single-turn editing benchmarks. We hope this work advances reliable, professional-grade agentic image editing and its integration into real workflows.</description>

      <title>Tele-Omni: a Unified Multimodal Framework for Video Generation and Editing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have substantially improved visual fidelity and temporal coherence. However, most existing approaches remain task-specific and rely primarily on textual instructions, limiting their ability to handle multimodal inputs, contextual references, and diverse video generation and editing scenarios within a unified framework. Moreover, many video editing methods depend on carefully engineered pipelines tailored to individual operations, which hinders scalability and composability. In this paper, we propose Tele-Omni, a unified multimodal framework for video generation and editing that follows multimodal instructions, including text, images, and reference videos, within a single model. Tele-Omni leverages pretrained multimodal large language models to parse heterogeneous instructions and infer structured generation or editing intents, while diffusion-based generators perform high-quality video synthesis conditioned on these structured signals. To enable joint training across heterogeneous video tasks, we introduce a task-aware data processing pipeline that unifies multimodal inputs into a structured instruction format while preserving task-specific constraints. Tele-Omni supports a wide range of video-centric tasks, including text-to-video generation, image-to-video generation, first-last-frame video generation, in-context video generation, and in-context video editing. By decoupling instruction parsing from video synthesis and combining it with task-aware data design, Tele-Omni achieves flexible multimodal control while maintaining strong temporal coherence and visual consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that Tele-Omni achieves competitive performance across multiple tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain Generalized Video Semantic Segmentation (DGVSS) is trained on a single labeled driving domain and is directly deployed on unseen domains without target labels and test-time adaptation while maintaining temporally consistent predictions over video streams. In practice, both domain shift and temporal-sampling shift break correspondence-based propagation and fixed-stride temporal aggregation, causing severe frame-to-frame flicker even in label-stable regions. We propose Time2General, a DGVSS framework built on Stability Queries. Time2General introduces a Spatio-Temporal Memory Decoder that aggregates multi-frame context into a clip-level spatio-temporal memory and decodes temporally consistent per-frame masks without explicit correspondence propagation. To further suppress flicker and improve robustness to varying sampling rates, the Masked Temporal Consistency Loss is proposed to regularize temporal prediction discrepancies across different strides, and randomize training strides to expose the model to diverse temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on multiple driving benchmarks show that Time2General achieves a substantial improvement in cross-domain accuracy and temporal stability over prior DGSS and VSS baselines while running at up to 18 FPS. Code will be released after the review process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world data collection for embodied agents remains costly and unsafe, calling for scalable, realistic, and simulator-ready 3D environments. However, existing scene-generation systems often rely on rule-based or task-specific pipelines, yielding artifacts and physically invalid scenes. We present SAGE, an agentic framework that, given a user-specified embodied task (e.g., "pick up a bowl and place it on the table"), understands the intent and automatically generates simulation-ready environments at scale. The agent couples multiple generators for layout and object composition with critics that evaluate semantic plausibility, visual realism, and physical stability. Through iterative reasoning and adaptive tool selection, it self-refines the scenes until meeting user intent and physical validity. The resulting environments are realistic, diverse, and directly deployable in modern simulators for policy training. Policies trained purely on this data exhibit clear scaling trends and generalize to unseen objects and layouts, demonstrating the promise of simulation-driven scaling for embodied AI. Code, demos, and the SAGE-10k dataset can be found on the project page here: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/sage/.</description>

      <title>Handling Supervision Scarcity in Chest X-ray Classification: Long-Tailed and Zero-Shot Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chest X-Ray (CXR) classification in clinical practice is often limited by imperfect supervision, arising from (i) extreme long-tailed multi-label disease distributions and (ii) missing annotations for rare or previously unseen findings. The CXR-LT 2026 challenge addresses these issues on a PadChest-based benchmark with a 36-class label space split into 30 in-distribution classes for training and 6 out-of-distribution (OOD) classes for zero-shot evaluation. We present task-specific solutions tailored to the distinct supervision regimes. For Task 1 (long-tailed multi-label classification), we adopt an imbalance-aware multi-label learning strategy to improve recognition of tail classes while maintaining stable performance on frequent findings. For Task 2 (zero-shot OOD recognition), we propose a prediction approach that produces scores for unseen disease categories without using any supervised labels or examples from the OOD classes during training.

      <title>Embed-RL: Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning-Driven Multimodal Embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has become pivotal for advancing Universal Multimodal Embeddings (UME) in addressing diverse cross-modal tasks. Recent studies demonstrate that incorporating generative Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning can substantially enhance task-specific representations compared to discriminative methods. However, the generated reasoning CoTs of existing generative embedding methods are limited to the textual analysis of queries and are irrelevant to the retrieval of the targets. To address these limitations, we propose a reasoning-driven UME framework that integrates Embedder-Guided Reinforcement Learning (EG-RL) to optimize the Reasoner to produce evidential Traceability CoT (T-CoT). Our key contributions are threefold: (1) We design an EG-RL framework where the Embedder provides explicit supervision to the Reasoner, ensuring the generated CoT traces are aligned with embedding tasks. (2) We introduce T-CoT, which extracts critical multimodal cues to focus on retrieval-relevant elements and provides multimodal inputs for the Embedder. (3) With limited computational resources, our framework outperforms the pioneering embedding model on both MMEB-V2 and UVRB benchmarks. The integration of multimodal evidence in structured reasoning, paired with retrieval-oriented alignment, effectively strengthens cross-modal semantic consistency and boosts the fine-grained matching capability of the model as well as the generalization across complex scenarios. Our work demonstrates that targeted reasoning optimization can significantly improve multimodal embedding quality, providing a practical and efficient solution for reasoning-driven UME development.</description>

      <title>MedVAR: Towards Scalable and Efficient Medical Image Generation via Next-scale Autoregressive Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image generation is pivotal in applications like data augmentation for low-resource clinical tasks and privacy-preserving data sharing. However, developing a scalable generative backbone for medical imaging requires architectural efficiency, sufficient multi-organ data, and principled evaluation, yet current approaches leave these aspects unresolved. Therefore, we introduce MedVAR, the first autoregressive-based foundation model that adopts the next-scale prediction paradigm to enable fast and scale-up-friendly medical image synthesis. MedVAR generates images in a coarse-to-fine manner and produces structured multi-scale representations suitable for downstream use. To support hierarchical generation, we curate a harmonized dataset of around 440,000 CT and MRI images spanning six anatomical regions. Comprehensive experiments across fidelity, diversity, and scalability show that MedVAR achieves state-of-the-art generative performance and offers a promising architectural direction for future medical generative foundation models.</description>

      <title>A Novel Public Dataset for Strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) Ripeness Detection and Comparative Evaluation of YOLO-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa), known worldwide for its economic value and nutritional richness, is a widely cultivated fruit. Determining the correct ripeness level during the harvest period is crucial for both preventing losses for producers and ensuring consumers receive a quality product. However, traditional methods, i.e., visual assessments alone, can be subjective and have a high margin of error. Therefore, computer-assisted systems are needed. However, the scarcity of comprehensive datasets accessible to everyone in the literature makes it difficult to compare studies in this field. In this study, a new and publicly available strawberry ripeness dataset, consisting of 566 images and 1,201 labeled objects, prepared under variable light and environmental conditions in two different greenhouses in Turkey, is presented to the literature. Comparative tests conducted on the data set using YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLO11-based models showed that the highest precision value was 90.94% in the YOLOv9c model, while the highest recall value was 83.74% in the YOLO11s model. In terms of the general performance criterion mAP@50, YOLOv8s was the best performing model with a success rate of 86.09%. The results show that small and medium-sized models work more balanced and efficiently on this type of dataset, while also establishing a fundamental reference point for smart agriculture applications.</description>

      <title>Can Vision-Language Models See Squares? Text-Recognition Mediates Spatial Reasoning Across Three Model Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple experiment that exposes a fundamental limitation in vision-language models (VLMs): the inability to accurately localize filled cells in binary grids when those cells lack textual identity. We generate fifteen 15x15 grids with varying density (10.7%-41.8% filled cells) and render each as two image types -- text symbols (. and #) and filled squares without gridlines -- then ask three frontier VLMs (Claude Opus, ChatGPT 5.2, and Gemini 3 Thinking) to transcribe them. In the text-symbol condition, Claude and ChatGPT achieve approximately 91% cell accuracy and 84% F1, while Gemini achieves 84% accuracy and 63% F1. In the filled-squares condition, all three models collapse to 60-73% accuracy and 29-39% F1. Critically, all conditions pass through the same visual encoder -- the text symbols are images, not tokenized text. The text-vs-squares F1 gap ranges from 34 to 54 points across models, demonstrating that VLMs behave as if they possess a high-fidelity text-recognition pathway for spatial reasoning that dramatically outperforms their native visual pathway. Each model exhibits a distinct failure mode in the squares condition -- systematic under-counting (Claude), massive over-counting (ChatGPT), and template hallucination (Gemini) -- but all share the same underlying deficit: severely degraded spatial localization for non-textual visual elements.</description>

      <title>ReMoRa: Multimodal Large Language Model based on Refined Motion Representation for Long-Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable success across a wide range of tasks, long-form video understanding remains a significant challenge. In this study, we focus on video understanding by MLLMs. This task is challenging because processing a full stream of RGB frames is computationally intractable and highly redundant, as self-attention have quadratic complexity with sequence length. In this paper, we propose ReMoRa, a video MLLM that processes videos by operating directly on their compressed representations. A sparse set of RGB keyframes is retained for appearance, while temporal dynamics are encoded as a motion representation, removing the need for sequential RGB frames. These motion representations act as a compact proxy for optical flow, capturing temporal dynamics without full frame decoding. To refine the noise and low fidelity of block-based motions, we introduce a module to denoise and generate a fine-grained motion representation. Furthermore, our model compresses these features in a way that scales linearly with sequence length. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ReMoRa through extensive experiments across a comprehensive suite of long-video understanding benchmarks. ReMoRa outperformed baseline methods on multiple challenging benchmarks, including LongVideoBench, NExT-QA, and MLVU.</description>

      <title>StructCore: Structure-Aware Image-Level Scoring for Training-Free Unsupervised Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Max pooling is the de facto standard for converting anomaly score maps into image-level decisions in memory-bank-based unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD). However, because it relies on a single extreme response, it discards most information about how anomaly evidence is distributed and structured across the image, often causing normal and anomalous scores to overlap.
  We propose StructCore, a training-free, structure-aware image-level scoring method that goes beyond max pooling. Given an anomaly score map, StructCore computes a low-dimensional structural descriptor phi(S) that captures distributional and spatial characteristics, and refines image-level scoring via a diagonal Mahalanobis calibration estimated from train-good samples, without modifying pixel-level localization.
  StructCore achieves image-level AUROC scores of 99.6% on MVTec AD and 98.4% on VisA, demonstrating robust image-level anomaly detection by exploiting structural signatures missed by max pooling.</description>

      <title>GraphThinker: Reinforcing Video Reasoning with Event Graph Thinking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video reasoning requires understanding the causal relationships between events in a video. However, such relationships are often implicit and costly to annotate manually. While existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often infer event relations through dense captions or video summaries for video reasoning, such modeling still lacks causal understanding. Without explicit causal structure modeling within and across video events, these models suffer from hallucinations during the video reasoning. In this work, we propose GraphThinker, a reinforcement finetuning-based method that constructs structural event-level scene graphs and enhances visual grounding to jointly reduce hallucinations in video reasoning. Specifically, we first employ an MLLM to construct an event-based video scene graph (EVSG) that explicitly models both intra- and inter-event relations, and incorporate these formed scene graphs into the MLLM as an intermediate thinking process. We also introduce a visual attention reward during reinforcement finetuning, which strengthens video grounding and further mitigates hallucinations. We evaluate GraphThinker on two datasets, RexTime and VidHalluc, where it shows superior ability to capture object and event relations with more precise event localization, reducing hallucinations in video reasoning compared to prior methods.</description>

      <title>OpenEarthAgent: A Unified Framework for Tool-Augmented Geospatial Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has enabled agents that can interpret imagery, connect it with language, and perform structured analytical tasks. Extending such capabilities to the remote sensing domain remains challenging, as models must reason over spatial scale, geographic structures, and multispectral indices while maintaining coherent multi-step logic. To bridge this gap, OpenEarthAgent introduces a unified framework for developing tool-augmented geospatial agents trained on satellite imagery, natural-language queries, and detailed reasoning traces. The training pipeline relies on supervised fine-tuning over structured reasoning trajectories, aligning the model with verified multistep tool interactions across diverse analytical contexts. The accompanying corpus comprises 14,538 training and 1,169 evaluation instances, with more than 100K reasoning steps in the training split and over 7K reasoning steps in the evaluation split. It spans urban, environmental, disaster, and infrastructure domains, and incorporates GIS-based operations alongside index analyses such as NDVI, NBR, and NDBI. Grounded in explicit reasoning traces, the learned agent demonstrates structured reasoning, stable spatial understanding, and interpretable behaviour through tool-driven geospatial interactions across diverse conditions. We report consistent improvements over a strong baseline and competitive performance relative to recent open and closed-source models.</description>

      <title>VidEoMT: Your ViT is Secretly Also a Video Segmentation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing online video segmentation models typically combine a per-frame segmenter with complex specialized tracking modules. While effective, these modules introduce significant architectural complexity and computational overhead. Recent studies suggest that plain Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders, when scaled with sufficient capacity and large-scale pre-training, can conduct accurate image segmentation without requiring specialized modules. Motivated by this observation, we propose the Video Encoder-only Mask Transformer (VidEoMT), a simple encoder-only video segmentation model that eliminates the need for dedicated tracking modules. To enable temporal modeling in an encoder-only ViT, VidEoMT introduces a lightweight query propagation mechanism that carries information across frames by reusing queries from the previous frame. To balance this with adaptability to new content, it employs a query fusion strategy that combines the propagated queries with a set of temporally-agnostic learned queries. As a result, VidEoMT attains the benefits of a tracker without added complexity, achieving competitive accuracy while being 5x-10x faster, running at up to 160 FPS with a ViT-L backbone.

Abstract: Short-video platforms now host vast multimodal ads whose deceptive visuals, speech and subtitles demand finer-grained, policy-driven moderation than community safety filters. We present BLM-Guard, a content-audit framework for commercial ads that fuses Chain-of-Thought reasoning with rule-based policy principles and a critic-guided reward. A rule-driven ICoT data-synthesis pipeline jump-starts training by generating structured scene descriptions, reasoning chains and labels, cutting annotation costs. Reinforcement learning then refines the model using a composite reward balancing causal coherence with policy adherence. A multitask architecture models intra-modal manipulations (e.g., exaggerated imagery) and cross-modal mismatches (e.g., subtitle-speech drift), boosting robustness. Experiments on real short-video ads show BLM-Guard surpasses strong baselines in accuracy, consistency and generalization.</description>

Abstract: Despite the successes of deep learning in computer vision, difficulties persist in recognizing objects that have undergone group-symmetric transformations rarely seen during training$\unicode{x2013}$for example objects seen in unusual poses, scales, positions, or combinations thereof. Equivariant neural networks are a solution to the problem of generalizing across symmetric transformations, but require knowledge of transformations a priori. An alternative family of architectures proposes to learn equivariant operators in a latent space, from examples of symmetric transformations. Here, using simple datasets of rotated and translated noisy MNIST, we illustrate how such architectures can successfully be harnessed for out-of-distribution classification, thus overcoming the limitations of both traditional and equivariant networks. While conceptually enticing, we discuss challenges ahead on the path of scaling these architectures to more complex datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15702v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactive computer vision (CV) plays a crucial role in various real-world applications, whose performance is highly dependent on communication networks. Nonetheless, the data-oriented characteristics of conventional communications often do not align with the special needs of interactive CV tasks. To alleviate this issue, the recently emerged semantic communications only transmit task-related semantic information and exhibit a promising landscape to address this problem. However, the communication challenges associated with Semantic Facial Editing, one of the most important interactive CV applications on social media, still remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing Editable-DeepSC, a novel cross-modal semantic communication approach for facial editing. Firstly, we theoretically discuss different transmission schemes that separately handle communications and editings, and emphasize the necessity of Joint Editing-Channel Coding (JECC) via iterative attributes matching, which integrates editings into the communication chain to preserve more semantic mutual information. To compactly represent the high-dimensional data, we leverage inversion methods via pre-trained StyleGAN priors for semantic coding. To tackle the dynamic channel noise conditions, we propose SNR-aware channel coding via model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments indicate that Editable-DeepSC can achieve superior editings while significantly saving the transmission bandwidth, even under high-resolution and out-of-distribution (OOD) settings.</description>

Abstract: How do humans move? Advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have produced impressive results in capturing human motion using physics-based humanoid control. However, torque-controlled humanoids fail to model key aspects of human motor control such as biomechanical joint constraints \&amp; non-linear and overactuated musculotendon control. We present KINESIS, a model-free motion imitation framework that tackles these challenges. KINESIS is trained on 1.8 hours of locomotion data and achieves strong motion imitation performance on unseen trajectories. Through a negative mining approach, KINESIS learns robust locomotion priors that we leverage to deploy the policy on several downstream tasks such as text-to-control, target point reaching, and football penalty kicks. Importantly, KINESIS learns to generate muscle activity patterns that correlate well with human EMG activity. We show that these results scale seamlessly across biomechanical model complexity, demonstrating control of up to 290 muscles. Overall, the physiological plausibility makes KINESIS a promising model for tackling challenging problems in human motor control. Code, videos and benchmarks are available at https://github.com/amathislab/Kinesis.</description>

      <title>Noise-Aware Generalization: Robustness to In-Domain Noise and Out-of-Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Methods addressing Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) and multi-source Domain Generalization (DG) use training techniques to improve downstream task performance in the presence of label noise or domain shifts, respectively. Prior work often explores these tasks in isolation, and the limited work that does investigate their intersection, which we refer to as Noise-Aware Generalization (NAG), only benchmarks existing methods without also proposing an approach to reduce its effect. We find that this is likely due, in part, to the new challenges that arise when exploring NAG, which does not appear in LNL or DG alone. For example, we show that the effectiveness of DG methods is compromised in the presence of label noise, making them largely ineffective. Similarly, LNL methods often overfit to easy-to-learn domains as they confuse domain shifts for label noise. Instead, we propose Domain Labels for Noise Detection (DL4ND), the first direct method developed for NAG which uses our observation that noisy samples that may appear indistinguishable within a single domain often show greater variation when compared across domains. We find DL4ND outperforms DG and LNL methods, including their combinations, even when simplifying the NAG challenge by using domain labels to isolate domain shifts from noise. Performance gains up to 12.5% over seven diverse datasets with three noise types demonstrates DL4ND's ability to generalize to a wide variety of settings.</description>

      <title>GRILL: Restoring Gradient Signal in Ill-Conditioned Layers for More Effective Adversarial Attacks on Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03646v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial robustness of deep autoencoders (AEs) has received less attention than that of discriminative models, although their compressed latent representations induce ill-conditioned mappings that can amplify small input perturbations and destabilize reconstructions. Existing white-box attacks for AEs, which optimize norm-bounded adversarial perturbations to maximize output damage, often stop at suboptimal attacks. We observe that this limitation stems from vanishing adversarial loss gradients during backpropagation through ill-conditioned layers, caused by near-zero singular values in their Jacobians. To address this issue, we introduce GRILL, a technique that locally restores gradient signals in ill-conditioned layers, enabling more effective norm-bounded attacks. Through extensive experiments across multiple AE architectures, considering both sample-specific and universal attacks under both standard and adaptive attack settings, we show that GRILL significantly increases attack effectiveness, leading to a more rigorous evaluation of AE robustness. Beyond AEs, we provide empirical evidence that modern multimodal architectures with encoder-decoder structures exhibit similar vulnerabilities under GRILL.</description>

      <title>Feature Representation Transferring to Lightweight Models via Perception Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for transferring feature representation to lightweight student models from larger teacher models. We mathematically define a new notion called \textit{perception coherence}. Based on this notion, we propose a loss function, which takes into account the dissimilarities between data points in feature space through their ranking. At a high level, by minimizing this loss function, the student model learns to mimic how the teacher model \textit{perceives} inputs. More precisely, our method is motivated by the fact that the representational capacity of the student model is weaker than the teacher model. Hence, we aim to develop a new method allowing for a better relaxation. This means that, the student model does not need to preserve the absolute geometry of the teacher one, while preserving global coherence through dissimilarity ranking. Importantly, while rankings are defined only on finite sets, our notion of \textit{perception coherence} extends them into a probabilistic form. This formulation depends on the input distribution and applies to general dissimilarity metrics. Our theoretical insights provide a probabilistic perspective on the process of feature representation transfer. Our experiments results show that our method outperforms or achieves on-par performance compared to strong baseline methods for representation transferring.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Motion Compression and Selective Temporal Fusion for Neural B-Frame Video Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the remarkable progress in neural P-frame video coding, neural B-frame coding has recently emerged as a critical research direction. However, most existing neural B-frame codecs directly adopt P-frame coding tools without adequately addressing the unique challenges of B-frame compression, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose novel enhancements for motion compression and temporal fusion for neural B-frame coding. First, we design a fine-grained motion compression method. This method incorporates an interactive dual-branch motion auto-encoder with per-branch adaptive quantization steps, which enables fine-grained compression of bi-directional motion vectors while accommodating their asymmetric bitrate allocation and reconstruction quality requirements. Furthermore, this method involves an interactive motion entropy model that exploits correlations between bi-directional motion latent representations by interactively leveraging partitioned latent segments as directional priors. Second, we propose a selective temporal fusion method that predicts bi-directional fusion weights to achieve discriminative utilization of bi-directional multi-scale temporal contexts with varying qualities. Additionally, this method introduces a hyperprior-based implicit alignment mechanism for contextual entropy modeling. By treating the hyperprior as a surrogate for the contextual latent representation, this mechanism implicitly mitigates the misalignment in the fused bi-directional temporal priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed codec achieves an average BD-rate reduction of approximately 10% compared to the state-of-the-art neural B-frame codec, DCVC-B, and delivers comparable or even superior compression performance to the H.266/VVC reference software under random-access configurations.</description>

      <title>Perception Characteristics Distance: Measuring Stability and Robustness of Perception System in Dynamic Conditions under a Certain Decision Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The safety of autonomous driving systems (ADS) depends on accurate perception across distance and driving conditions. The outputs of AI perception algorithms are stochastic, which have a major impact on decision making and safety outcomes, including time-to-collision estimation. However, current perception evaluation metrics do not reflect the stochastic nature of perception algorithms. We introduce the Perception Characteristics Distance (PCD), a novel metric incorporating model output uncertainty as represented by the farthest distance at which an object can be reliably detected. To represent a system's overall perception capability in terms of reliable detection distance, we average PCD values across multiple detection quality and probabilistic thresholds to produce the average PCD (aPCD). For empirical validation, we present the SensorRainFall dataset, collected on the Virginia Smart Road using a sensor-equipped vehicle (cameras, radar, and LiDAR) under different weather (clear and rainy) and illumination conditions (daylight, streetlight, and nighttime). The dataset includes ground-truth distances, bounding boxes, and segmentation masks for target objects. Experiments with state-of-the-art models show that aPCD captures meaningful differences across weather, daylight, and illumination conditions, which traditional evaluation metrics fail to reflect. PCD provides an uncertainty-aware measure of perception performance, supporting safer and more robust ADS operation, while the SensorRainFall dataset offers a valuable benchmark for evaluation. The SensorRainFall dataset is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datadrivenwheels/sensorrainfall, and the evaluation code is available at https://github.com/datadrivenwheels/PCD_Python.</description>

      <title>Can Generalist Vision Language Models (VLMs) Rival Specialist Medical VLMs? Benchmarking and Strategic Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in automating image diagnosis and interpretation in clinical settings. However, developing specialist medical VLMs requires substantial computational resources and carefully curated datasets, and it remains unclear under which conditions generalist and specialist medical VLMs each perform best. This study highlights the complementary strengths of specialist medical and generalist VLMs. Specialists remain valuable in modality-aligned use cases, but we find that efficiently fine-tuned generalist VLMs can achieve comparable or even superior performance in most tasks, particularly when transferring to unseen or rare OOD medical modalities. These results suggest that generalist VLMs, rather than being constrained by their lack of specialist medical pretraining, may offer a scalable and cost-effective pathway for advancing clinical AI development.</description>

      <title>FLUID: A Fine-Grained Lightweight Urban Signalized-Intersection Dataset of Dense Conflict Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The trajectory data of traffic participants (TPs) is a fundamental resource for evaluating traffic conditions and optimizing policies, especially at urban intersections. Although data acquisition using drones is efficient, existing datasets still have limitations in scene representativeness, information richness, and data fidelity. This study introduces FLUID, comprising a fine-grained trajectory dataset that captures dense conflicts at typical urban signalized intersections, and a lightweight, full-pipeline framework for drone-based trajectory processing. FLUID covers three distinct intersection types, with approximately 5 hours of recording time and featuring over 20,000 TPs across 8 categories. Notably, the dataset records an average of 2.8 vehicle conflicts per minute across all scenes, with roughly 15% of all recorded motor vehicles directly involved in these conflicts. FLUID provides comprehensive data, including trajectories, traffic signals, maps, and raw videos. Comparison with the DataFromSky platform and ground-truth measurements validates its high spatio-temporal accuracy. Through a detailed classification of motor vehicle conflicts and violations, FLUID reveals a diversity of interactive behaviors, demonstrating its value for human preference mining, traffic behavior modeling, and autonomous driving research.</description>

      <title>Decoding Tourist Perception in Historic Urban Quarters with Multimodal Social Media Data: An AI-Based Framework and Evidence from Shanghai</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Historic urban quarters are increasingly shaped by tourism and lifestyle consumption, yet planners often lack scalable evidence on what visitors notice, prefer, and criticize in these environments. This study proposes an AI-based, multimodal framework to decode tourist perception by combining visual attention, color-based aesthetic representation, and multidimensional satisfaction. We collect geotagged photos and review texts from a major Chinese platform and assemble a street view image set as a baseline for comparison across 12 historic urban quarters in Shanghai. We train a semantic segmentation model to quantify foregrounded visual elements in tourist-shared imagery, extract and compare color palettes between social media photos and street views, and apply a multi-task sentiment classifier to assess satisfaction across four experience dimensions that correspond to activity, physical setting, supporting services, and commercial offerings. Results show that tourist photos systematically foreground key streetscape elements and that the color composition represented on social media can differ from on-site street views, indicating a perception-reality gap that varies by quarter. The framework offers an interpretable and transferable approach to diagnose such gaps and to inform heritage management and visitor-oriented urban design.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Power of Discrete-Time State Representation: Ultrafast Target-based IMU-Camera Spatial-Temporal Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual-inertial fusion is crucial for a large amount of intelligent and autonomous applications, such as robot navigation and augmented reality. To bootstrap and achieve optimal state estimation, the spatial-temporal displacements between IMU and cameras must be calibrated in advance. Most existing calibration methods adopt continuous-time state representation, more specifically the B-spline. Despite these methods achieve precise spatial-temporal calibration, they suffer from high computational cost caused by continuous-time state representation. To this end, we propose a novel and extremely efficient calibration method that unleashes the power of discrete-time state representation. Moreover, the weakness of discrete-time state representation in temporal calibration is tackled in this paper. With the increasing production of drones, cellphones and other visual-inertial platforms, if one million devices need calibration around the world, saving one minute for the calibration of each device means saving 2083 work days in total. To benefit both the research and industry communities, the open-source implementation is released at https://github.com/JunlinSong/DT-VI-Calib.</description>

      <title>VIRTUE: Visual-Interactive Text-Image Universal Embedder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal representation learning models have demonstrated successful operation across complex tasks, and the integration of vision-language models (VLMs) has further enabled embedding models with instruction-following capabilities. However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn entity-level information within images to complement their global representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.</description>

      <title>BEAT: Visual Backdoor Attacks on VLM-based Embodied Agents via Contrastive Trigger Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have propelled embodied agents by enabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from visual inputs. However, such vision-driven embodied agents open a new attack surface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a visual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an attacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to inject such visual backdoors into VLM-based embodied agents using objects in the environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit wide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant reliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that spans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger variability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning (CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between trigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision boundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent benchmarks and VLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while maintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to out-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL boosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data. These findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in VLM-based embodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>SelfAI: A self-directed framework for long-horizon scientific discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific discovery increasingly entails long-horizon exploration of complex hypothesis spaces, yet most existing approaches emphasize final performance while offering limited insight into how scientific exploration unfolds over time, particularly balancing efficiency-diversity trade-offs and supporting reproducible, human-in-the-loop discovery workflows. We introduce SelfAI, a self-directed, multi-agent-enabled discovery system that automates scientific exploration as a strategic, trajectory-driven decision-making process. SelfAI translates high-level research intent into executable experiments, reasons over accumulated experimental trajectories to guide subsequent exploration, and applies adaptive stopping decisions to terminate unproductive search paths within a closed-loop workflow governed by explicit efficiency-diversity trade-offs. Evaluated using real-world experiments spanning domains from machine learning to drug discovery, SelfAI consistently discovers high-quality solutions with substantially fewer redundant trials than classical optimization and recent LLM-based baselines. The proposed methods establish a general framework for organizing long-horizon scientific discovery and adaptive decision-making in complex scientific and engineering systems.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Aligned Calibration for Post-Training Quantization of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in image synthesis by progressively estimating a smooth transition from a Gaussian distribution of noise to a real image. Unfortunately, their practical deployment is limited by slow inference speed, high memory usage, and the computational demands of the noise estimation process. Post-training quantization (PTQ) emerges as a promising solution to accelerate sampling and reduce memory overhead for diffusion models. Existing PTQ methods for diffusion models typically apply uniform weights to calibration samples across timesteps, which is sub-optimal since data at different timesteps may contribute differently to the diffusion process. Additionally, due to varying activation distributions and gradients across timesteps, a uniform quantization approach is sub-optimal. Each timestep requires a different gradient direction for optimal quantization, and treating them equally can lead to conflicting gradients that degrade performance. In this paper, we propose a novel PTQ method that addresses these challenges by assigning appropriate weights to calibration samples. Specifically, our approach learns to assign optimal weights to calibration samples to align the quantized model's gradients across timesteps, facilitating the quantization process. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, LSUN-Bedrooms, and ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to other PTQ methods for diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot Multi-Contrast Brain MRI Registration by Intensity Randomizing T1-weighted MRI (LUMIR25)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present our submission to the LUMIR25 task of Learn2Reg 2025, which ranked 1st overall on the test set. Extended from LUMIR24, this year's task focuses on zero-shot registration under domain shifts (e.g., high-field MRI, pathological brains, and various MRI contrasts), while the training data comprises only in-domain T1-weighted brain MRI. We start with a meticulous analysis of LUMIR24 winners to identify the main contributors to strong monomodal registration performance. We highlight the importance of registration-specific inductive biases, including multi-resolution pyramids, inverse and group consistency, topological preservation or diffeomorphism, and correlation-based correspondence establishment. To further generalize to diverse contrasts, we employ three simple but effective strategies: (i) a multimodal loss based on the modality-independent neighborhood descriptor (MIND), (ii) intensity randomization for unseen contrast augmentation, and (iii) lightweight instance-specific optimization (ISO) on feature encoders at inference time. On the validation set, the proposed approach substantially improves T1-T2 registration accuracy, demonstrating robust cross-contrast generalization without relying on explicit image synthesis. These results suggest a practical step toward a registration foundation model that can leverage a single training domain yet remain robust across domain shifts.</description>

      <title>Refine Now, Query Fast: A Decoupled Refinement Paradigm for Implicit Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as promising surrogates for large 3D scientific simulations due to their ability to continuously model spatial and conditional fields, yet they face a critical fidelity-speed dilemma: deep MLPs suffer from high inference cost, while efficient embedding-based models lack sufficient expressiveness. To resolve this, we propose the Decoupled Representation Refinement (DRR) architectural paradigm. DRR leverages a deep refiner network, alongside non-parametric transformations, in a one-time offline process to encode rich representations into a compact and efficient embedding structure. This approach decouples slow neural networks with high representational capacity from the fast inference path. We introduce DRR-Net, a simple network that validates this paradigm, and a novel data augmentation strategy, Variational Pairs (VP) for improving INRs under complex tasks like high-dimensional surrogate modeling. Experiments on several ensemble simulation datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art fidelity, while being up to 27$\times$ faster at inference than high-fidelity baselines and remaining competitive with the fastest models. The DRR paradigm offers an effective strategy for building powerful and practical neural field surrogates and \rev{INRs in broader applications}, with a minimal compromise between speed and quality.</description>

      <title>DesignAsCode: Bridging Structural Editability and Visual Fidelity in Graphic Design Generation</title>

Abstract: Graphic design generation demands a delicate balance between high visual fidelity and fine-grained structural editability. However, existing approaches typically bifurcate into either non-editable raster image synthesis or abstract layout generation devoid of visual content. Recent combinations of these two approaches attempt to bridge this gap but often suffer from rigid composition schemas and unresolvable visual dissonances (e.g., text-background conflicts) due to their inexpressive representation and open-loop nature. To address these challenges, we propose DesignAsCode, a novel framework that reimagines graphic design as a programmatic synthesis task using HTML/CSS. Specifically, we introduce a Plan-Implement-Reflect pipeline, incorporating a Semantic Planner to construct dynamic, variable-depth element hierarchies and a Visual-Aware Reflection mechanism that iteratively optimizes the code to rectify rendering artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DesignAsCode significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both structural validity and aesthetic quality. Furthermore, our code-native representation unlocks advanced capabilities, including automatic layout retargeting, complex document generation (e.g., resumes), and CSS-based animation.
