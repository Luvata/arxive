      <title>FedDW: Distilling Weights through Consistency Optimization in Heterogeneous Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an innovative distributed machine learning paradigm that enables neural network training across devices without centralizing data. While this addresses issues of information sharing and data privacy, challenges arise from data heterogeneity across clients and increasing network scale, leading to impacts on model performance and training efficiency. Previous research shows that in IID environments, the parameter structure of the model is expected to adhere to certain specific consistency principles. Thus, identifying and regularizing these consistencies can mitigate issues from heterogeneous data. We found that both soft labels derived from knowledge distillation and the classifier head parameter matrix, when multiplied by their own transpose, capture the intrinsic relationships between data classes. These shared relationships suggest inherent consistency. Therefore, the work in this paper identifies the consistency between the two and leverages it to regulate training, underpinning our proposed FedDW framework. Experimental results show FedDW outperforms 10 state-of-the-art FL methods, improving accuracy by an average of 3% in highly heterogeneous settings. Additionally, we provide a theoretical proof that FedDW offers higher efficiency, with the additional computational load from backpropagation being negligible.

      <title>Leveraging Multimodal Protein Representations to Predict Protein Melting Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting protein melting temperature changes (Delta Tm) is fundamental for assessing protein stability and guiding protein engineering. Leveraging multi-modal protein representations has shown great promise in capturing the complex relationships among protein sequences, structures, and functions. In this study, we develop models based on powerful protein language models, including ESM-2, ESM-3, SaProt, and AlphaFold, using various feature extraction methods to enhance prediction accuracy. By utilizing the ESM-3 model, we achieve a new state-of-the-art performance on the s571 test dataset, obtaining a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.50. Furthermore, we conduct a fair evaluation to compare the performance of different protein language models in the Delta Tm prediction task. Our results demonstrate that integrating multi-modal protein representations could advance the prediction of protein melting temperatures.</description>

      <title>WinTSR: A Windowed Temporal Saliency Rescaling Method for Interpreting Time Series Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpreting complex time series forecasting models is challenging due to the temporal dependencies between time steps and the dynamic relevance of input features over time. Existing interpretation methods are limited by focusing mostly on classification tasks, evaluating using custom baseline models instead of the latest time series models, using simple synthetic datasets, and requiring training another model. We introduce a novel interpretation method called Windowed Temporal Saliency Rescaling (WinTSR) addressing these limitations. WinTSR explicitly captures temporal dependencies among the past time steps and efficiently scales the feature importance with this time importance. We benchmark WinTSR against 10 recent interpretation techniques with 5 state-of-the-art deep-learning models of different architectures, including a time series foundation model. We use 3 real-world datasets for both time-series classification and regression. Our comprehensive analysis shows that WinTSR significantly outranks the other local interpretation methods in overall performance. Finally, we provide a novel and open-source framework to interpret the latest time series transformers and foundation models.</description>

      <title>Communication Compression for Distributed Learning without Control Variates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed learning algorithms, such as the ones employed in Federated Learning (FL), require communication compression to reduce the cost of client uploads. The compression methods used in practice are often biased, which require error feedback to achieve convergence when the compression is aggressive. In turn, error feedback requires client-specific control variates, which directly contradicts privacy-preserving principles and requires stateful clients. In this paper, we propose Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe), a novel distributed learning framework that allows highly compressible client updates by exploiting past aggregated updates, and does not require control variates. We consider Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) as a representative algorithm and provide a theoretical proof of CAFe's superiority to Distributed Compressed Gradient Descent (DCGD) with biased compression in the non-smooth regime with bounded gradient dissimilarity. Experimental results confirm that CAFe consistently outperforms distributed learning with direct compression and highlight the compressibility of the client updates with CAFe.</description>

      <title>Solving High-dimensional Inverse Problems Using Amortized Likelihood-free Inference with Noisy and Incomplete Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel likelihood-free probabilistic inversion method based on normalizing flows for high-dimensional inverse problems. The proposed method is comprised of two complementary networks: a summary network for data compression, and an inference network for parameter estimation. The summary network encodes raw observations into a fixed-size vector of summary statistics, while the inference network generates samples of the approximate posterior distribution of the model parameters based on these summary statistics. The posterior samples are produced in a deep generative fashion by sampling from a latent Gaussian distribution and passing these samples through an invertible transformation. We construct this invertible transformation by sequentially alternating conditional invertible neural network (cINN) and conditional neural spline flow (cNSF) layers. The summary and inference networks are trained simultaneously. We apply the proposed method to an inversion problem in groundwater hydrology to estimate the posterior distribution of the system's log-conductivity field conditioned on spatially sparse time-series observations of the system's hydraulic head responses. The conductivity field is represented with 706 degrees of freedom in the considered problem. The comparison with the likelihood-based iterative ensemble smoother PEST-IES method demonstrates that the proposed method accurately estimates the parameter posterior distribution and the observations' predictive posterior distribution at a fraction of the inference time of PEST-IES.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven, Parameterized Reduced-order Models for Predicting Distortion in Metal 3D Printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), the applied laser energy produces high thermal gradients that lead to unacceptable final part distortion. Accurate distortion prediction is essential for optimizing the 3D printing process and manufacturing a part that meets geometric accuracy requirements. This study introduces data-driven parameterized reduced-order models (ROMs) to predict distortion in LPBF across various machine process settings. We propose a ROM framework that combines Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and compare its performance against a deep-learning based parameterized graph convolutional autoencoder (GCA). The POD-GPR model demonstrates high accuracy, predicting distortions within $\pm0.001mm$, and delivers a computational speed-up of approximately 1800x.</description>

      <title>Learning Symmetries via Weight-Sharing with Doubly Stochastic Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group equivariance has emerged as a valuable inductive bias in deep learning, enhancing generalization, data efficiency, and robustness. Classically, group equivariant methods require the groups of interest to be known beforehand, which may not be realistic for real-world data. Additionally, baking in fixed group equivariance may impose overly restrictive constraints on model architecture. This highlights the need for methods that can dynamically discover and apply symmetries as soft constraints. For neural network architectures, equivariance is commonly achieved through group transformations of a canonical weight tensor, resulting in weight sharing over a given group $G$. In this work, we propose to learn such a weight-sharing scheme by defining a collection of learnable doubly stochastic matrices that act as soft permutation matrices on canonical weight tensors, which can take regular group representations as a special case. This yields learnable kernel transformations that are jointly optimized with downstream tasks. We show that when the dataset exhibits strong symmetries, the permutation matrices will converge to regular group representations and our weight-sharing networks effectively become regular group convolutions. Additionally, the flexibility of the method enables it to effectively pick up on partial symmetries.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Operator Learning Using Energy Minimization and MLPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and evaluate a method for learning solution operators to nonlinear problems governed by partial differential equations. The approach is based on a finite element discretization and aims at representing the solution operator by an MLP that takes latent variables as input. The latent variables will typically correspond to parameters in a parametrization of input data such as boundary conditions, coefficients, and right-hand sides. The loss function is most often an energy functional and we formulate efficient parallelizable training algorithms based on assembling the energy locally on each element. For large problems, the learning process can be made more efficient by using only a small fraction of randomly chosen elements in the mesh in each iteration. The approach is evaluated on several relevant test cases, where learning the solution operator turns out to be beneficial compared to classical numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Extractive Structures Learned in Pretraining Enable Generalization on Finetuned Facts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretrained language models (LMs) can generalize to implications of facts that they are finetuned on. For example, if finetuned on ``John Doe lives in Tokyo," LMs can correctly answer ``What language do the people in John Doe's city speak?'' with ``Japanese''. However, little is known about the mechanisms that enable this generalization or how they are learned during pretraining. We introduce extractive structures as a framework for describing how components in LMs (e.g., MLPs or attention heads) coordinate to enable this generalization. The structures consist of informative components that store training facts as weight changes, and upstream and downstream extractive components that query and process the stored information to produce the correct implication. We hypothesize that extractive structures are learned during pretraining when encountering implications of previously known facts. This yields two predictions: a data ordering effect where extractive structures can be learned only if facts precede their implications, and a weight grafting effect where extractive structures can be transferred to predict counterfactual implications. We empirically demonstrate these phenomena in the OLMo-7b, Llama 3-8b, Gemma 2-9b, and Qwen 2-7b models. Of independent interest, our results also indicate that fact learning can occur at both early and late layers, which lead to different forms of generalization.</description>

      <title>Sometimes I am a Tree: Data Drives Unstable Hierarchical Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks often favor shortcut heuristics based on surface-level patterns. As one example, language models (LMs) behave like n-gram models early in training. However, to correctly apply grammatical rules, LMs must rely on hierarchical syntactic representations instead of n-grams. In this work, we use cases studies of English grammar to explore how latent structure in training data drives models toward improved out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization.We then investigate how data composition can lead to inconsistent OOD behavior across random seeds and to unstable training dynamics. Our results show that models stabilize in their OOD behavior only when they fully commit to either a surface-level linear rule or a hierarchical rule. The hierarchical rule, furthermore, is induced by grammatically complex sequences with deep embedding structures, whereas the linear rule is induced by simpler sequences. When the data contains a mix of simple and complex examples, potential rules compete; each independent training run either stabilizes by committing to a single rule or remains unstable in its OOD behavior. These conditions lead `stable seeds' to cluster around simple rules, forming bimodal performance distributions across seeds. We also identify an exception to the relationship between stability and generalization: models which memorize patterns from low-diversity training data can overfit stably, with different rules for memorized and unmemorized patterns. Our findings emphasize the critical role of training data in shaping generalization patterns and how competition between data subsets contributes to inconsistent generalization outcomes across random seeds.

      <title>BigDocs: An Open and Permissively-Licensed Dataset for Training Multimodal Models on Document and Code Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal AI has the potential to significantly enhance document-understanding tasks, such as processing receipts, understanding workflows, extracting data from documents, and summarizing reports. Code generation tasks that require long-structured outputs can also be enhanced by multimodality. Despite this, their use in commercial applications is often limited due to limited access to training data and restrictive licensing, which hinders open access. To address these limitations, we introduce BigDocs-7.5M, a high-quality, open-access dataset comprising 7.5 million multimodal documents across 30 tasks. We use an efficient data curation process to ensure our data is high-quality and license-permissive. Our process emphasizes accountability, responsibility, and transparency through filtering rules, traceable metadata, and careful content analysis. Additionally, we introduce BigDocs-Bench, a benchmark suite with 10 novel tasks where we create datasets that reflect real-world use cases involving reasoning over Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) and code generation from images. Our experiments show that training with BigDocs-Bench improves average performance up to 25.8% over closed-source GPT-4o in document reasoning and structured output tasks such as Screenshot2HTML or Image2Latex generation. Finally, human evaluations showed a preference for outputs from models trained on BigDocs over GPT-4o. This suggests that BigDocs can help both academics and the open-source community utilize and improve AI tools to enhance multimodal capabilities and document reasoning.

      <title>SWEPO: Simultaneous Weighted Preference Optimization for Group Contrastive Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Simultaneous Weighted Preference Optimization (SWEPO), a novel extension of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) designed to accommodate multiple dynamically chosen positive and negative responses for each query. SWEPO employs a weighted group contrastive loss, assigning weights to responses based on their deviation from the mean reward score. This approach effectively prioritizes responses that are significantly better or worse than the average, enhancing optimization. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that simultaneously considering multiple preferences reduces alignment bias, resulting in more robust alignment. Additionally, we provide insights into the training dynamics of our loss function and a related function, InfoNCA. Empirical validation on the UltraFeedback dataset establishes SWEPO as state-of-the-art, with superior performance in downstream evaluations using the AlpacaEval dataset.</description>

      <title>Disentangled Representation Learning for Causal Inference with Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent confounders are a fundamental challenge for inferring causal effects from observational data. The instrumental variable (IV) approach is a practical way to address this challenge. Existing IV based estimators need a known IV or other strong assumptions, such as the existence of two or more IVs in the system, which limits the application of the IV approach. In this paper, we consider a relaxed requirement, which assumes there is an IV proxy in the system without knowing which variable is the proxy. We propose a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) based disentangled representation learning method to learn an IV representation from a dataset with latent confounders and then utilise the IV representation to obtain an unbiased estimation of the causal effect from the data. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing IV based estimators and VAE-based estimators.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be effective on tabular prediction tasks in the low-data regime, leveraging their internal knowledge and ability to learn from instructions and examples. However, LLMs can fail to generate predictions that satisfy group fairness, that is, produce equitable outcomes across groups. Critically, conventional debiasing approaches for natural language tasks do not directly translate to mitigating group unfairness in tabular settings. In this work, we systematically investigate four empirical approaches to improve group fairness of LLM predictions on tabular datasets, including fair prompt optimization, soft prompt tuning, strategic selection of few-shot examples, and self-refining predictions via chain-of-thought reasoning. Through experiments on four tabular datasets using both open-source and proprietary LLMs, we show the effectiveness of these methods in enhancing demographic parity while maintaining high overall performance. Our analysis provides actionable insights for practitioners in selecting the most suitable approach based on their specific requirements and constraints.</description>

      <title>One Communication Round is All It Needs for Federated Fine-Tuning Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent advancement of large foundation models (FMs) has increased the demand for fine-tuning these models on large-scale and cross-domain datasets. To address this, federated fine-tuning has emerged as a solution, allowing models to be fine-tuned on distributed datasets across multiple devices while ensuring data privacy. However, the substantial parameter size of FMs and the multi-round communication required by traditional federated fine-tuning algorithms result in prohibitively high communication costs, challenging the practicality of federated fine-tuning. In this paper, we are the first to reveal, both theoretically and empirically, that the traditional multi-round aggregation algorithms may not be necessary for federated fine-tuning large FMs. Our experiments reveal that a single round of communication (i.e., one-shot federated fine-tuning) yields a global model performance comparable to that achieved through multiple rounds of communication. Through rigorous mathematical and empirical analyses, we demonstrate that large FMs, due to their extensive parameter sizes and pre-training on general tasks, achieve significantly lower training loss in one-shot federated fine-tuning compared to smaller models. Our extensive experiments show that one-shot federated fine-tuning not only reduces communication costs but also enables asynchronous aggregation, enhances privacy, and maintains performance consistency with multi-round federated fine-tuning for models larger than 1 billion parameters, on text generation and text-to-image generation tasks. Our findings have the potential to revolutionize federated fine-tuning in practice, enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and expanding accessibility for large-scale models. This breakthrough paves the way for broader adoption and application of federated fine-tuning across various domains.</description>

      <title>Soft Tensor Product Representations for Fully Continuous, Compositional Visual Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the inception of the classicalist vs. connectionist debate, it has been argued that the ability to systematically combine symbol-like entities into compositional representations is crucial for human intelligence. In connectionist systems, the field of disentanglement has emerged to address this need by producing representations with explicitly separated factors of variation (FoV). By treating the overall representation as a *string-like concatenation* of the inferred FoVs, however, disentanglement provides a fundamentally *symbolic* treatment of compositional structure, one inherently at odds with the underlying *continuity* of deep learning vector spaces. We hypothesise that this symbolic-continuous mismatch produces broadly suboptimal performance in deep learning models that learn or use such representations. To fully align compositional representations with continuous vector spaces, we extend Smolensky's Tensor Product Representation (TPR) and propose a new type of inherently *continuous* compositional representation, *Soft TPR*, along with a theoretically-principled architecture, *Soft TPR Autoencoder*, designed specifically for learning Soft TPRs. In the visual representation learning domain, our Soft TPR confers broad benefits over symbolic compositional representations: state-of-the-art disentanglement and improved representation learner convergence, along with enhanced sample efficiency and superior low-sample regime performance for downstream models, empirically affirming the value of our inherently continuous compositional representation learning framework.</description>

      <title>Zephyr quantum-assisted hierarchical Calo4pQVAE for particle-calorimeter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the approach of the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) era set to begin particle collisions by the end of this decade, it is evident that the computational demands of traditional collision simulation methods are becoming increasingly unsustainable. Existing approaches, which rely heavily on first-principles Monte Carlo simulations for modeling event showers in calorimeters, are projected to require millions of CPU-years annually -- far exceeding current computational capacities. This bottleneck presents an exciting opportunity for advancements in computational physics by integrating deep generative models with quantum simulations. We propose a quantum-assisted hierarchical deep generative surrogate founded on a variational autoencoder (VAE) in combination with an energy conditioned restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) embedded in the model's latent space as a prior. By mapping the topology of D-Wave's Zephyr quantum annealer (QA) into the nodes and couplings of a 4-partite RBM, we leverage quantum simulation to accelerate our shower generation times significantly. To evaluate our framework, we use Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge 2022. Through the integration of classical computation and quantum simulation, this hybrid framework paves way for utilizing large-scale quantum simulations as priors in deep generative models.</description>

      <title>Two stages domain invariant representation learners solve the large co-variate shift in unsupervised domain adaptation with two dimensional data domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enable the unsupervised machine learning (ML) prediction for target data, thus this will accelerate real world applications with ML models such as image recognition tasks in self-driving. Researchers have reported the UDA techniques are not working well under large co-variate shift problems where e.g. supervised source data consists of handwritten digits data in monotone color and unsupervised target data colored digits data from the street view. Thus there is a need for a method to resolve co-variate shift and transfer source labelling rules under this dynamics. We perform two stages domain invariant representation learning to bridge the gap between source and target with semantic intermediate data (unsupervised). The proposed method can learn domain invariant features simultaneously between source and intermediate also intermediate and target. Finally this achieves good domain invariant representation between source and target plus task discriminability owing to source labels. This induction for the gradient descent search greatly eases learning convergence in terms of classification performance for target data even when large co-variate shift. We also derive a theorem for measuring the gap between trained models and unsupervised target labelling rules, which is necessary for the free parameters optimization. Finally we demonstrate that proposing method is superiority to previous UDA methods using 4 representative ML classification datasets including 38 UDA tasks. Our experiment will be a basis for challenging UDA problems with large co-variate shift.</description>

      <title>An Experimental Evaluation of Imputation Models for Spatial-Temporal Traffic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic data imputation is a critical preprocessing step in intelligent transportation systems, enabling advanced transportation services. Despite significant advancements in this field, selecting the most suitable model for practical applications remains challenging due to three key issues: 1) incomprehensive consideration of missing patterns that describe how data loss along spatial and temporal dimensions, 2) the lack of test on standardized datasets, and 3) insufficient evaluations. To this end, we first propose practice-oriented taxonomies for missing patterns and imputation models, systematically identifying all possible forms of real-world traffic data loss and analyzing the characteristics of existing models. Furthermore, we introduce a unified benchmarking pipeline to comprehensively evaluate 10 representative models across various missing patterns and rates. This work aims to provide a holistic understanding of traffic data imputation research and serve as a practical guideline.</description>

      <title>Generative Humanization for Therapeutic Antibodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antibody therapies have been employed to address some of today's most challenging diseases, but must meet many criteria during drug development before reaching a patient. Humanization is a sequence optimization strategy that addresses one critical risk called immunogenicity - a patient's immune response to the drug - by making an antibody more "human-like" in the absence of a predictive lab-based test for immunogenicity. However, existing humanization strategies generally yield very few humanized candidates, which may have degraded biophysical properties or decreased drug efficacy. Here, we re-frame humanization as a conditional generative modeling task, where humanizing mutations are sampled from a language model trained on human antibody data. We describe a sampling process that incorporates models of therapeutic attributes, such as antigen binding affinity, to obtain candidate sequences that have both reduced immunogenicity risk and maintained or improved therapeutic properties, allowing this algorithm to be readily embedded into an iterative antibody optimization campaign. We demonstrate in silico and in lab validation that in real therapeutic programs our generative humanization method produces diverse sets of antibodies that are both (1) highly-human and (2) have favorable therapeutic properties, such as improved binding to target antigens.</description>

      <title>DHIL-GT: Scalable Graph Transformer with Decoupled Hierarchy Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Transformer (GT) has recently emerged as a promising neural network architecture for learning graph-structured data. However, its global attention mechanism with quadratic complexity concerning the graph scale prevents wider application to large graphs. While current methods attempt to enhance GT scalability by altering model architecture or encoding hierarchical graph data, our analysis reveals that these models still suffer from the computational bottleneck related to graph-scale operations. In this work, we target the GT scalability issue and propose DHIL-GT, a scalable Graph Transformer that simplifies network learning by fully decoupling the graph computation to a separate stage in advance. DHIL-GT effectively retrieves hierarchical information by exploiting the graph labeling technique, as we show that the graph label hierarchy is more informative than plain adjacency by offering global connections while promoting locality, and is particularly suitable for handling complex graph patterns such as heterophily. We further design subgraph sampling and positional encoding schemes for precomputing model input on top of graph labels in an end-to-end manner. The training stage thus favorably removes graph-related computations, leading to ideal mini-batch capability and GPU utilization. Notably, the precomputation and training processes of DHIL-GT achieve complexities linear to the number of graph edges and nodes, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DHIL-GT is efficient in terms of computational boost and mini-batch capability over existing scalable Graph Transformer designs on large-scale benchmarks, while achieving top-tier effectiveness on both homophilous and heterophilous graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to learn relational policies for classical planning based on learning to rank actions. We introduce a new graph representation that explicitly captures action information and propose a Graph Neural Network architecture augmented with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to learn action rankings. Our model is trained on small problem instances and generalizes to significantly larger instances where traditional planning becomes computationally expensive. Experimental results across standard planning benchmarks demonstrate that our action-ranking approach achieves generalization to significantly larger problems than those used in training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the latent spaces learned by deep learning models is crucial in exploring how they represent and generate complex data. Autoencoders (AEs) have played a key role in the area of representation learning, with numerous regularization techniques and training principles developed not only to enhance their ability to learn compact and robust representations, but also to reveal how different architectures influence the structure and smoothness of the lower-dimensional non-linear manifold. We strive to characterize the structure of the latent spaces learned by different autoencoders including convolutional autoencoders (CAEs), denoising autoencoders (DAEs), and variational autoencoders (VAEs) and how they change with the perturbations in the input. By characterizing the matrix manifolds corresponding to the latent spaces, we provide an explanation for the well-known observation that the latent spaces of CAE and DAE form non-smooth manifolds, while that of VAE forms a smooth manifold. We also map the points of the matrix manifold to a Hilbert space using distance preserving transforms and provide an alternate view in terms of the subspaces generated in the Hilbert space as a function of the distortion in the input. The results show that the latent manifolds of CAE and DAE are stratified with each stratum being a smooth product manifold, while the manifold of VAE is a smooth product manifold of two symmetric positive definite matrices and a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix.</description>

      <title>Towards counterfactual fairness thorough auxiliary variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of balancing fairness and predictive accuracy in machine learning models, especially when sensitive attributes such as race, gender, or age are considered, has motivated substantial research in recent years. Counterfactual fairness ensures that predictions remain consistent across counterfactual variations of sensitive attributes, which is a crucial concept in addressing societal biases. However, existing counterfactual fairness approaches usually overlook intrinsic information about sensitive features, limiting their ability to achieve fairness while simultaneously maintaining performance. To tackle this challenge, we introduce EXOgenous Causal reasoning (EXOC), a novel causal reasoning framework motivated by exogenous variables. It leverages auxiliary variables to uncover intrinsic properties that give rise to sensitive attributes. Our framework explicitly defines an auxiliary node and a control node that contribute to counterfactual fairness and control the information flow within the model. Our evaluation, conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets, validates EXOC's superiority, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in achieving counterfactual fairness.</description>

      <title>A Temporally Correlated Latent Exploration for Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient exploration remains one of the longstanding problems of deep reinforcement learning. Instead of depending solely on extrinsic rewards from the environments, existing methods use intrinsic rewards to enhance exploration. However, we demonstrate that these methods are vulnerable to Noisy TV and stochasticity. To tackle this problem, we propose Temporally Correlated Latent Exploration (TeCLE), which is a novel intrinsic reward formulation that employs an action-conditioned latent space and temporal correlation. The action-conditioned latent space estimates the probability distribution of states, thereby avoiding the assignment of excessive intrinsic rewards to unpredictable states and effectively addressing both problems. Whereas previous works inject temporal correlation for action selection, the proposed method injects it for intrinsic reward computation. We find that the injected temporal correlation determines the exploratory behaviors of agents. Various experiments show that the environment where the agent performs well depends on the amount of temporal correlation. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed TeCLE is the first approach to consider the action conditioned latent space and temporal correlation for curiosity-driven exploration. We prove that the proposed TeCLE can be robust to the Noisy TV and stochasticity in benchmark environments, including Minigrid and Stochastic Atari.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based large language models are a memory-bound model whose operation is based on a large amount of data that are marginally reused. Thus, the data movement between a host and accelerator likely dictates the total wall-clock time. Layer normalization is one of the key workloads in the transformer model, following each of multi-head attention and feed-forward network blocks. To reduce data movement, layer normalization needs to be performed on the same chip as the matrix-matrix multiplication engine. To this end, we introduce an iterative L2-normalization method for 1D input (IterNorm), ensuring fast convergence to the steady-state solution within five iteration steps and high precision, outperforming the fast inverse square root algorithm in six out of nine cases for FP32 and five out of nine for BFloat16 across the embedding lengths used in the OPT models. Implemented in 32/28nm CMOS, the IterNorm macro normalizes $d$-dimensional vectors, where $64 \leq d \leq 1024$, with a latency of 112-227 cycles at 100MHz/1.05V.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection and Classification in Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalies such as redundant, inconsistent, contradictory, and deficient values in a Knowledge Graph (KG) are unavoidable, as these graphs are often curated manually, or extracted using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. Therefore, anomaly detection is a task that can enhance the quality of KGs. In this paper, we propose SEKA (SEeking Knowledge graph Anomalies), an unsupervised approach for the detection of abnormal triples and entities in KGs. SEKA can help improve the correctness of a KG whilst retaining its coverage. We propose an adaption of the Path Rank Algorithm (PRA), named the Corroborative Path Rank Algorithm (CPRA), which is an efficient adaptation of PRA that is customized to detect anomalies in KGs. Furthermore, we also present TAXO (TAXOnomy of anomaly types in KGs), a taxonomy of possible anomaly types that can occur in a KG. This taxonomy provides a classification of the anomalies discovered by SEKA with an extensive discussion of possible data quality issues in a KG. We evaluate both approaches using the four real-world KGs YAGO-1, KBpedia, Wikidata, and DSKG to demonstrate the ability of SEKA and TAXO to outperform the baselines.</description>

      <title>DPGIIL: Dirichlet Process-Deep Generative Model-Integrated Incremental Learning for Clustering in Transmissibility-based Online Structural Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering based on vibration responses, such as transmissibility functions (TFs), is promising in structural anomaly detection, but most existing approaches struggle with determining the optimal cluster number and handling high-dimensional streaming data, while their shallow structures also make them sensitive to manually-engineered feature quality. To bridge this gap, this work proposes the Dirichlet process-deep generative model-integrated incremental learning (DPGIIL) for clustering by combining the advantages of deep generative models (DGMs) in representation learning and the Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM) in identifying distinct patterns in observed data. By introducing a DPMM prior into the latent space of DGMs, DPGIIL automatically captures dissimilarities in extracted latent representations, enabling both generative modeling and clustering. Within the context of variational Bayesian inference, a lower bound on the log marginal likelihood of DPGIIL, tighter than the evidence lower bound given sufficient training data, is derived analytically, which enables the joint optimization of DGM and DPMM parameters, thereby allowing the DPMM to regularize the DGM's feature extraction process. Additionally, a greedy split-merge scheme-based coordinate ascent variational inference method is devised to accelerate the optimization. The summary statistics of the DPMM, along with the network parameters, are used to retain information about previous data for incremental learning. Notably, this study uses variational autoencoder (VAE) within DPGIIL as an illustrative example, while this framework is adaptable to other DGMs. Two case studies show that the proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art approaches in structural anomaly detection and clustering, while also dynamically generating new clusters to indicate the emergence of new structural conditions for online monitoring.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Random Feature Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms has received great attention in recent years, especially in the setting when the data contains sensitive information. Differential privacy (DP) is a widely used mechanism for data analysis with privacy guarantees. In this paper, we produce a differentially private random feature model. Random features, which were proposed to approximate large-scale kernel machines, have been used to study privacy-preserving kernel machines as well. We consider the over-parametrized regime (more features than samples) where the non-private random feature model is learned via solving the min-norm interpolation problem, and then we apply output perturbation techniques to produce a private model. We show that our method preserves privacy and derive a generalization error bound for the method. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider privacy-preserving random feature models in the over-parametrized regime and provide theoretical guarantees. We empirically compare our method with other privacy-preserving learning methods in the literature as well. Our results show that our approach is superior to the other methods in terms of generalization performance on synthetic data and benchmark data sets. Additionally, it was recently observed that DP mechanisms may exhibit and exacerbate disparate impact, which means that the outcomes of DP learning algorithms vary significantly among different groups. We show that both theoretically and empirically, random features have the potential to reduce disparate impact, and hence achieve better fairness.</description>

      <title>Direct Quantized Training of Language Models with Stochastic Rounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although recent quantized Large Language Models (LLMs), such as BitNet, have paved the way for significant reduction in memory usage during deployment with binary or ternary weights, training these models still demands substantial memory footprints. This is partly because high-precision (i.e., unquantized) weight matrices required for straight-through estimation must be maintained throughout the whole training process. To address this, we explore the potential of directly updating the quantized low-precision weight matrices without relying on the straight-through estimator during backpropagation, thereby saving memory usage during training. Specifically, we employ a stochastic rounding technique to minimize information loss caused by the use of low-bit weights throughout training. Experimental results on our LLaMA-structured models indicate that (1) training with only low-precision weights is feasible even when they are constrained to ternary values, (2) extending the bit width to 8 bits results in only a 5% loss degradation compared to BitNet b1.58 while offering the potential for reduced memory usage during training, and (3) our models can also perform inference using ternary weights, showcasing their flexibility in deployment.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Time Series Forecasting with LLMs via Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) that are extensively trained on abundant text data, and customizing the input prompt to enable time series forecasting has received considerable attention. While recent work has shown great potential for adapting the learned prior of LLMs, the formulation of the prompt to finetune LLMs remains challenging as prompt should be aligned with time series data. Additionally, current approaches do not effectively leverage word token embeddings which embody the rich representation space learned by LLMs. This emphasizes the need for a robust approach to formulate the prompt which utilizes the word token embeddings while effectively representing the characteristics of the time series. To address these challenges, we propose NNCL-TLLM: Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning for Time series forecasting via LLMs. First, we generate time series compatible text prototypes such that each text prototype represents both word token embeddings in its neighborhood and time series characteristics via end-to-end finetuning. Next, we draw inspiration from Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning to formulate the prompt while obtaining the top-$k$ nearest neighbor time series compatible text prototypes. We then fine-tune the layer normalization and positional embeddings of the LLM, keeping the other layers intact, reducing the trainable parameters and decreasing the computational cost. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NNCL-TLLM outperforms in few-shot forecasting while achieving competitive or superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods in long-term and short-term forecasting tasks.</description>

      <title>CCS: Continuous Learning for Customized Incremental Wireless Sensing Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless sensing has made significant progress in tasks ranging from action recognition, vital sign estimation, pose estimation, etc. After over a decade of work, wireless sensing currently stands at the tipping point transitioning from proof-of-concept systems to the large-scale deployment. We envision a future service scenario where wireless sensing service providers distribute sensing models to users. During usage, users might request new sensing capabilities. For example, if someone is away from home on a business trip or vacation for an extended period, they may want a new sensing capability that can detect falls in elderly parents or grandparents and promptly alert them. In this paper, we propose CCS (continuous customized service), enabling model updates on users' local computing resources without data transmission to the service providers. To address the issue of catastrophic forgetting in model updates where updating model parameters to implement new capabilities leads to the loss of existing capabilities we design knowledge distillation and weight alignment modules. These modules enable the sensing model to acquire new capabilities while retaining the existing ones. We conducted extensive experiments on the large-scale XRF55 dataset across Wi-Fi, millimeter-wave radar, and RFID modalities to simulate scenarios where four users sequentially introduced new customized demands. The results affirm that CCS excels in continuous model services across all the above wireless modalities, significantly outperforming existing approaches like OneFi.</description>

      <title>Wavelet Diffusion Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating and controlling physical systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs) are crucial tasks across science and engineering. Recently, diffusion generative models have emerged as a competitive class of methods for these tasks due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies and model high-dimensional states. However, diffusion models typically struggle with handling system states with abrupt changes and generalizing to higher resolutions. In this work, we propose Wavelet Diffusion Neural Operator (WDNO), a novel PDE simulation and control framework that enhances the handling of these complexities. WDNO comprises two key innovations. Firstly, WDNO performs diffusion-based generative modeling in the wavelet domain for the entire trajectory to handle abrupt changes and long-term dependencies effectively. Secondly, to address the issue of poor generalization across different resolutions, which is one of the fundamental tasks in modeling physical systems, we introduce multi-resolution training. We validate WDNO on five physical systems, including 1D advection equation, three challenging physical systems with abrupt changes (1D Burgers' equation, 1D compressible Navier-Stokes equation and 2D incompressible fluid), and a real-world dataset ERA5, which demonstrates superior performance on both simulation and control tasks over state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvements in long-term and detail prediction accuracy. Remarkably, in the challenging context of the 2D high-dimensional and indirect control task aimed at reducing smoke leakage, WDNO reduces the leakage by 33.2% compared to the second-best baseline.</description>

      <title>Using Machine Learning to Discover Parsimonious and Physically-Interpretable Representations of Catchment-Scale Rainfall-Runoff Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the excellent real-world predictive performance of modern machine learning (ML) methods, many scientists remain hesitant to discard traditional physical-conceptual (PC) approaches due mainly to their relative interpretability, which contributes to credibility during decision-making. In this context, a currently underexplored aspect of ML is how to develop minimally-optimal representations that can facilitate better insight regarding system functioning. Regardless of how this is achieved, it is arguably true that parsimonious representations better support the advancement of scientific understanding. Our own view is that ML-based modeling of geoscientific systems should be based in the use of computational units that are fundamentally interpretable by design.
  This paper continues our exploration of how the strengths of ML can be exploited in the service of better understanding via scientific investigation. Here, we use the Mass Conserving Perceptron (MCP) as the fundamental computational unit in a generic network architecture consisting of nodes arranged in series and parallel to explore several generic and important issues related to the use of observational data for constructing input-state-output models of dynamical systems. In the context of lumped catchment modeling, we show that physical interpretability and excellent predictive performance can both be achieved using a relatively parsimonious distributed-state multiple-flow-path network with context-dependent gating and information sharing across the nodes, suggesting that MCP-based modeling can play a significant role in application of ML to geoscientific investigation.</description>

      <title>MSECG: Incorporating Mamba for Robust and Efficient ECG Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals play a crucial role in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. To reduce power consumption in wearable or portable devices used for long-term ECG monitoring, super-resolution (SR) techniques have been developed, enabling these devices to collect and transmit signals at a lower sampling rate. In this study, we propose MSECG, a compact neural network model designed for ECG SR. MSECG combines the strength of the recurrent Mamba model with convolutional layers to capture both local and global dependencies in ECG waveforms, allowing for the effective reconstruction of high-resolution signals. We also assess the model's performance in real-world noisy conditions by utilizing ECG data from the PTB-XL database and noise data from the MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database. Experimental results show that MSECG outperforms two contemporary ECG SR models under both clean and noisy conditions while using fewer parameters, offering a more powerful and robust solution for long-term ECG monitoring applications.</description>

      <title>Nonmyopic Global Optimisation via Approximate Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconstrained global optimisation aims to optimise expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions without gradient information. Bayesian optimisation, one of the most well-known techniques, typically employs Gaussian processes as surrogate models, leveraging their probabilistic nature to balance exploration and exploitation. However, Gaussian processes become computationally prohibitive in high-dimensional spaces. Recent alternatives, based on inverse distance weighting (IDW) and radial basis functions (RBFs), offer competitive, computationally lighter solutions. Despite their efficiency, both traditional global and Bayesian optimisation strategies suffer from the myopic nature of their acquisition functions, which focus solely on immediate improvement neglecting future implications of the sequential decision making process. Nonmyopic acquisition functions devised for the Bayesian setting have shown promise in improving long-term performance. Yet, their use in deterministic strategies with IDW and RBF remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce novel nonmyopic acquisition strategies tailored to IDW- and RBF-based global optimisation. Specifically, we develop dynamic programming-based paradigms, including rollout and multi-step scenario-based optimisation schemes, to enable lookahead acquisition. These methods optimise a sequence of query points over a horizon (instead of only at the next step) by predicting the evolution of the surrogate model, inherently managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off in a systematic way via optimisation techniques. The proposed approach represents a significant advance in extending nonmyopic acquisition principles, previously confined to Bayesian optimisation, to the deterministic framework. Empirical results on synthetic and hyperparameter tuning benchmark problems demonstrate that these nonmyopic methods outperform conventional myopic approaches.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Non-Invasive Detection and Staging of Steatosis in Fatty Liver Disease Using a Novel Cascade Model and Information Fusion Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most widespread liver disorders on a global scale, posing a significant threat of progressing to more severe conditions like nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Diagnosing and staging NAFLD presents challenges due to its non-specific symptoms and the invasive nature of liver biopsies. Our research introduces a novel artificial intelligence cascade model employing ensemble learning and feature fusion techniques. We developed a non-invasive, robust, and reliable diagnostic artificial intelligence tool that utilizes anthropometric and laboratory parameters, facilitating early detection and intervention in NAFLD progression. Our novel artificial intelligence achieved an 86% accuracy rate for the NASH steatosis staging task (non-NASH, steatosis grade 1, steatosis grade 2, and steatosis grade 3) and an impressive 96% AUC-ROC for distinguishing between NASH (steatosis grade 1, grade 2, and grade3) and non-NASH cases, outperforming current state-of-the-art models. This notable improvement in diagnostic performance underscores the potential application of artificial intelligence in the early diagnosis and treatment of NAFLD, leading to better patient outcomes and a reduced healthcare burden associated with advanced liver disease.</description>

      <title>Learning High-Degree Parities: The Crucial Role of the Initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parities have become a standard benchmark for evaluating learning algorithms. Recent works show that regular neural networks trained by gradient descent can efficiently learn degree $k$ parities on uniform inputs for constant $k$, but fail to do so when $k$ and $d-k$ grow with $d$ (here $d$ is the ambient dimension). However, the case where $k=d-O_d(1)$ (almost-full parities), including the degree $d$ parity (the full parity), has remained unsettled. This paper shows that for gradient descent on regular neural networks, learnability depends on the initial weight distribution. On one hand, the discrete Rademacher initialization enables efficient learning of almost-full parities, while on the other hand, its Gaussian perturbation with large enough constant standard deviation $\sigma$ prevents it. The positive result for almost-full parities is shown to hold up to $\sigma=O(d^{-1})$, pointing to questions about a sharper threshold phenomenon. Unlike statistical query (SQ) learning, where a singleton function class like the full parity is trivially learnable, our negative result applies to a fixed function and relies on an initial gradient alignment measure of potential broader relevance to neural networks learning.</description>

      <title>Achieving Group Fairness through Independence in Predictive Process Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive process monitoring focuses on forecasting future states of ongoing process executions, such as predicting the outcome of a particular case. In recent years, the application of machine learning models in this domain has garnered significant scientific attention. When using historical execution data, which may contain biases or exhibit unfair behavior, these biases may be encoded into the trained models. Consequently, when such models are deployed to make decisions or guide interventions for new cases, they risk perpetuating this unwanted behavior. This work addresses group fairness in predictive process monitoring by investigating independence, i.e. ensuring predictions are unaffected by sensitive group membership. We explore independence through metrics for demographic parity such as $\Delta$DP, as well as recently introduced, threshold-independent distribution-based alternatives. Additionally, we propose a composite loss functions existing of binary cross-entropy and a distribution-based loss (Wasserstein) to train models that balance predictive performance and fairness, and allow for customizable trade-offs. The effectiveness of both the fairness metrics and the composite loss functions is validated through a controlled experimental setup.</description>

      <title>Bed-Attached Vibration Sensor System: A Machine Learning Approach for Fall Detection in Nursing Homes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing shortage of nursing staff and the acute risk of falls in nursing homes pose significant challenges for the healthcare system. This study presents the development of an automated fall detection system integrated into care beds, aimed at enhancing patient safety without compromising privacy through wearables or video monitoring. Mechanical vibrations transmitted through the bed frame are processed using a short-time Fourier transform, enabling robust classification of distinct human fall patterns with a convolutional neural network. Challenges pertaining to the quantity and diversity of the data are addressed, proposing the generation of additional data with a specific emphasis on enhancing variation. While the model shows promising results in distinguishing fall events from noise using lab data, further testing in real-world environments is recommended for validation and improvement. Despite limited available data, the proposed system shows the potential for an accurate and rapid response to falls, mitigating health implications, and addressing the needs of an aging population. This case study was performed as part of the ZIM Project. Further research on sensors enhanced by artificial intelligence will be continued in the ShapeFuture Project.</description>

      <title>Putting the Iterative Training of Decision Trees to the Test on a Real-World Robotic Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous research, we developed methods to train decision trees (DT) as agents for reinforcement learning tasks, based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) networks. The samples from which the DTs are built, use the environment's state as features and the corresponding action as label. To solve the nontrivial task of selecting samples, which on one hand reflect the DRL agent's capabilities of choosing the right action but on the other hand also cover enough state space to generalize well, we developed an algorithm to iteratively train DTs.
  In this short paper, we apply this algorithm to a real-world implementation of a robotic task for the first time. Real-world tasks pose additional challenges compared to simulations, such as noise and delays. The task consists of a physical pendulum attached to a cart, which moves on a linear track. By movements to the left and to the right, the pendulum is to be swung in the upright position and balanced in the unstable equilibrium. Our results demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm to real-world tasks by generating a DT whose performance matches the performance of the DRL agent, while consisting of fewer parameters. This research could be a starting point for distilling DTs from DRL agents to obtain transparent, lightweight models for real-world reinforcement learning tasks.</description>

Abstract: Causal systems often exhibit variations of the underlying causal mechanisms between the variables of the system. Often, these changes are driven by different environments or internal states in which the system operates, and we refer to context variables as those variables that indicate this change in causal mechanisms. An example are the causal relations in soil moisture-temperature interactions and their dependence on soil moisture regimes: Dry soil triggers a dependence of soil moisture on latent heat, while environments with wet soil do not feature such a feedback, making it a context-specific property. Crucially, a regime or context variable such as soil moisture need not be exogenous and can be influenced by the dynamical system variables - precipitation can make a dry soil wet - leading to joint systems with endogenous context variables. In this work we investigate the assumptions for constraint-based causal discovery of context-specific information in systems with endogenous context variables. We show that naive approaches such as learning different regime graphs on masked data, or pooling all data, can lead to uninformative results. We propose an adaptive constraint-based discovery algorithm and give a detailed discussion on the connection to structural causal models, including sufficiency assumptions, which allow to prove the soundness of our algorithm and to interpret the results causally. Numerical experiments demonstrate the performance of the proposed method over alternative baselines, but they also unveil current limitations of our method.</description>

      <title>Power Plant Detection for Energy Estimation using GIS with Remote Sensing, CNN &amp; Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we propose a hybrid model for power plant detection to assist energy estimation applications, by pipelining GIS (Geographical Information Systems) having Remote Sensing capabilities with CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and ViT (Vision Transformers). Our proposed approach enables real-time analysis with multiple data types on a common map via the GIS, entails feature-extraction abilities due to the CNN, and captures long-range dependencies through the ViT. This hybrid approach is found to enhance classification, thus helping in the monitoring and operational management of power plants; hence assisting energy estimation and sustainable energy planning in the future. It exemplifies adequate deployment of machine learning methods in conjunction with domain-specific approaches to enhance performance.</description>

      <title>Noise Matters: Diffusion Model-based Urban Mobility Generation with Collaborative Noise Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With global urbanization, the focus on sustainable cities has largely grown, driving research into equity, resilience, and urban planning, which often relies on mobility data. The rise of web-based apps and mobile devices has provided valuable user data for mobility-related research. However, real-world mobility data is costly and raises privacy concerns. To protect privacy while retaining key features of real-world movement, the demand for synthetic data has steadily increased. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown great potential for mobility trajectory generation due to their ability to model randomness and uncertainty. However, existing approaches often directly apply identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise sampling from image generation techniques, which fail to account for the spatiotemporal correlations and social interactions that shape urban mobility patterns. In this paper, we propose CoDiffMob, a diffusion method for urban mobility generation with collaborative noise priors, we emphasize the critical role of noise in diffusion models for generating mobility data. By leveraging both individual movement characteristics and population-wide dynamics, we construct novel collaborative noise priors that provide richer and more informative guidance throughout the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, with generated data accurately capturing both individual preferences and collective patterns, achieving an improvement of over 32\%. Furthermore, it can effectively replace web-derived mobility data to better support downstream applications, while safeguarding user privacy and fostering a more secure and ethical web. This highlights its tremendous potential for applications in sustainable city-related research.</description>

      <title>Prompt Transfer for Dual-Aspect Cross Domain Cognitive Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive Diagnosis (CD) aims to evaluate students' cognitive states based on their interaction data, enabling downstream applications such as exercise recommendation and personalized learning guidance. However, existing methods often struggle with accuracy drops in cross-domain cognitive diagnosis (CDCD), a practical yet challenging task. While some efforts have explored exercise-aspect CDCD, such as crosssubject scenarios, they fail to address the broader dual-aspect nature of CDCD, encompassing both student- and exerciseaspect variations. This diversity creates significant challenges in developing a scenario-agnostic framework. To address these gaps, we propose PromptCD, a simple yet effective framework that leverages soft prompt transfer for cognitive diagnosis. PromptCD is designed to adapt seamlessly across diverse CDCD scenarios, introducing PromptCD-S for student-aspect CDCD and PromptCD-E for exercise-aspect CDCD. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of PromptCD, consistently achieving superior performance across various CDCD scenarios. Our work offers a unified and generalizable approach to CDCD, advancing both theoretical and practical understanding in this critical domain. The implementation of our framework is publicly available at https://github.com/Publisher-PromptCD/PromptCD.</description>

      <title>Backdooring Outlier Detection Methods: A Novel Attack Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There have been several efforts in backdoor attacks, but these have primarily focused on the closed-set performance of classifiers (i.e., classification). This has left a gap in addressing the threat to classifiers' open-set performance, referred to as outlier detection in the literature. Reliable outlier detection is crucial for deploying classifiers in critical real-world applications such as autonomous driving and medical image analysis. First, we show that existing backdoor attacks fall short in affecting the open-set performance of classifiers, as they have been specifically designed to confuse intra-closed-set decision boundaries. In contrast, an effective backdoor attack for outlier detection needs to confuse the decision boundary between the closed and open sets. Motivated by this, in this study, we propose BATOD, a novel Backdoor Attack targeting the Outlier Detection task. Specifically, we design two categories of triggers to shift inlier samples to outliers and vice versa. We evaluate BATOD using various real-world datasets and demonstrate its superior ability to degrade the open-set performance of classifiers compared to previous attacks, both before and after applying defenses.</description>

      <title>Mixed Blessing: Class-Wise Embedding guided Instance-Dependent Partial Label Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In partial label learning (PLL), every sample is associated with a candidate label set comprising the ground-truth label and several noisy labels. The conventional PLL assumes the noisy labels are randomly generated (instance-independent), while in practical scenarios, the noisy labels are always instance-dependent and are highly related to the sample features, leading to the instance-dependent partial label learning (IDPLL) problem. Instance-dependent noisy label is a double-edged sword. On one side, it may promote model training as the noisy labels can depict the sample to some extent. On the other side, it brings high label ambiguity as the noisy labels are quite undistinguishable from the ground-truth label. To leverage the nuances of IDPLL effectively, for the first time we create class-wise embeddings for each sample, which allow us to explore the relationship of instance-dependent noisy labels, i.e., the class-wise embeddings in the candidate label set should have high similarity, while the class-wise embeddings between the candidate label set and the non-candidate label set should have high dissimilarity. Moreover, to reduce the high label ambiguity, we introduce the concept of class prototypes containing global feature information to disambiguate the candidate label set. Extensive experimental comparisons with twelve methods on six benchmark data sets, including four fine-grained data sets, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Yangfc-ML/CEL.</description>

      <title>Generating Rectifiable Measures through Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive universal approximation results for the class of (countably) $m$-rectifiable measures. Specifically, we prove that $m$-rectifiable measures can be approximated as push-forwards of the one-dimensional Lebesgue measure on $[0,1]$ using ReLU neural networks with arbitrarily small approximation error in terms of Wasserstein distance. What is more, the weights in the networks under consideration are quantized and bounded and the number of ReLU neural networks required to achieve an approximation error of $\varepsilon$ is no larger than $2^{b(\varepsilon)}$ with $b(\varepsilon)=\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-m}\log^2(\varepsilon))$. This result improves Lemma IX.4 in Perekrestenko et al. as it shows that the rate at which $b(\varepsilon)$ tends to infinity as $\varepsilon$ tends to zero equals the rectifiability parameter $m$, which can be much smaller than the ambient dimension. We extend this result to countably $m$-rectifiable measures and show that this rate still equals the rectifiability parameter $m$ provided that, among other technical assumptions, the measure decays exponentially on the individual components of the countably $m$-rectifiable support set.</description>

      <title>Transformers Can Navigate Mazes With Multi-Step Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their remarkable success in language modeling, transformers trained to predict the next token in a sequence struggle with long-term planning. This limitation is particularly evident in tasks requiring foresight to plan multiple steps ahead such as maze navigation. The standard next single token prediction objective, however, offers no explicit mechanism to predict multiple steps ahead - or revisit the path taken so far. Consequently, in this work we study whether explicitly predicting multiple steps ahead (and backwards) can improve transformers' maze navigation. We train parameter-matched transformers from scratch, under identical settings, to navigate mazes of varying types and sizes with standard next token prediction and MLM-U, an objective explicitly predicting multiple steps ahead and backwards. We find that MLM-U considerably improves transformers' ability to navigate mazes compared to standard next token prediction across maze types and complexities. We also find MLM-U training is 4x more sample efficient and converges 2x faster in terms of GPU training hours relative to next token training. Finally, for more complex mazes we find MLM-U benefits from scaling to larger transformers. Remarkably, we find transformers trained with MLM-U outperform larger transformers trained with next token prediction using additional supervision from A* search traces. We hope these findings underscore the promise of learning objectives to advance transformers' capacity for long-term planning.</description>

      <title>Robust Computation with Intrinsic Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsic within-type neuronal heterogeneity is a ubiquitous feature of biological systems, with well-documented computational advantages. Recent works in machine learning have incorporated such diversities by optimizing neuronal parameters alongside synaptic connections and demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across common benchmarks. However, this performance gain comes at the cost of significantly higher computational costs, imposed by a larger parameter space. Furthermore, it is unclear how the neuronal parameters, constrained by the biophysics of their surroundings, are globally orchestrated to minimize top-down errors. To address these challenges, we postulate that neurons are intrinsically diverse, and investigate the computational capabilities of such heterogeneous neuronal parameters. Our results show that intrinsic heterogeneity, viewed as a fixed quenched disorder, often substantially improves performance across hundreds of temporal tasks. Notably, smaller but heterogeneous networks outperform larger homogeneous networks, despite consuming less data. We elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving this performance boost and illustrate its applicability to both rate and spiking dynamics. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that heterogeneous networks are highly resilient to severe alterations in their recurrent synaptic hyperparameters, and even recurrent connections removal does not compromise performance. The remarkable effectiveness of heterogeneous networks with small sizes and relaxed connectivity is particularly relevant for the neuromorphic community, which faces challenges due to device-to-device variability. Furthermore, understanding the mechanism of robust computation with heterogeneity also benefits neuroscientists and machine learners.</description>

      <title>Learning Hidden Physics and System Parameters with Deep Operator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Big data is transforming scientific progress by enabling the discovery of novel models, enhancing existing frameworks, and facilitating precise uncertainty quantification, while advancements in scientific machine learning complement this by providing powerful tools to solve inverse problems to identify the complex systems where traditional methods falter due to sparse or noisy data. We introduce two innovative neural operator frameworks tailored for discovering hidden physics and identifying unknown system parameters from sparse measurements. The first framework integrates a popular neural operator, DeepONet, and a physics-informed neural network to capture the relationship between sparse data and the underlying physics, enabling the accurate discovery of a family of governing equations. The second framework focuses on system parameter identification, leveraging a DeepONet pre-trained on sparse sensor measurements to initialize a physics-constrained inverse model. Both frameworks excel in handling limited data and preserving physical consistency. Benchmarking on the Burgers' equation and reaction-diffusion system demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving average $L_2$ errors of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ for hidden physics discovery and absolute errors of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ for parameter identification. These results underscore the frameworks' robustness, efficiency, and potential for solving complex scientific problems with minimal observational data.</description>

      <title>Effective Rank and the Staircase Phenomenon: New Insights into Neural Network Training Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning, powered by neural networks, has achieved widespread success in solving high-dimensional problems, particularly those with low-dimensional feature structures. This success stems from their ability to identify and learn low dimensional features tailored to the problems. Understanding how neural networks extract such features during training dynamics remains a fundamental question in deep learning theory. In this work, we propose a novel perspective by interpreting the neurons in the last hidden layer of a neural network as basis functions that represent essential features. To explore the linear independence of these basis functions throughout the deep learning dynamics, we introduce the concept of 'effective rank'. Our extensive numerical experiments reveal a notable phenomenon: the effective rank increases progressively during the learning process, exhibiting a staircase-like pattern, while the loss function concurrently decreases as the effective rank rises. We refer to this observation as the 'staircase phenomenon'. Specifically, for deep neural networks, we rigorously prove the negative correlation between the loss function and effective rank, demonstrating that the lower bound of the loss function decreases with increasing effective rank. Therefore, to achieve a rapid descent of the loss function, it is critical to promote the swift growth of effective rank. Ultimately, we evaluate existing advanced learning methodologies and find that these approaches can quickly achieve a higher effective rank, thereby avoiding redundant staircase processes and accelerating the rapid decline of the loss function.</description>

      <title>Navigating Shortcuts, Spurious Correlations, and Confounders: From Origins via Detection to Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shortcuts, also described as Clever Hans behavior, spurious correlations, or confounders, present a significant challenge in machine learning and AI, critically affecting model generalization and robustness. Research in this area, however, remains fragmented across various terminologies, hindering the progress of the field as a whole. Consequently, we introduce a unifying taxonomy of shortcut learning by providing a formal definition of shortcuts and bridging the diverse terms used in the literature. In doing so, we further establish important connections between shortcuts and related fields, including bias, causality, and security, where parallels exist but are rarely discussed. Our taxonomy organizes existing approaches for shortcut detection and mitigation, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of the field and revealing underexplored areas and open challenges. Moreover, we compile and classify datasets tailored to study shortcut learning. Altogether, this work provides a holistic perspective to deepen understanding and drive the development of more effective strategies for addressing shortcuts in machine learning.</description>

      <title>A text-to-tabular approach to generate synthetic patient data using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access to large-scale high-quality healthcare databases is key to accelerate medical research and make insightful discoveries about diseases. However, access to such data is often limited by patient privacy concerns, data sharing restrictions and high costs. To overcome these limitations, synthetic patient data has emerged as an alternative. However, synthetic data generation (SDG) methods typically rely on machine learning (ML) models trained on original data, leading back to the data scarcity problem. We propose an approach to generate synthetic tabular patient data that does not require access to the original data, but only a description of the desired database. We leverage prior medical knowledge and in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate realistic patient data, even in a low-resource setting. We quantitatively evaluate our approach against state-of-the-art SDG models, using fidelity, privacy, and utility metrics. Our results show that while LLMs may not match the performance of state-of-the-art models trained on the original data, they effectively generate realistic patient data with well-preserved clinical correlations. An ablation study highlights key elements of our prompt contributing to high-quality synthetic patient data generation. This approach, which is easy to use and does not require original data or advanced ML skills, is particularly valuable for quickly generating custom-designed patient data, supporting project implementation and providing educational resources.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding the Role of Sharpness-Aware Minimization Algorithms for Out-of-Distribution Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has emerged as a promising method to improve generalization by minimizing sharpness, which is known to correlate well with generalization ability. Since the original proposal of SAM, many variants of SAM have been proposed to improve its accuracy and efficiency, but comparisons have mainly been restricted to the i.i.d. setting. In this paper we study SAM for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. First, we perform a comprehensive comparison of eight SAM variants on zero-shot OOD generalization, finding that the original SAM outperforms the Adam baseline by $4.76\%$ and the strongest SAM variants outperform the Adam baseline by $8.01\%$ on average. We then provide an OOD generalization bound in terms of sharpness for this setting. Next, we extend our study of SAM to the related setting of gradual domain adaptation (GDA), another form of OOD generalization where intermediate domains are constructed between the source and target domains, and iterative self-training is done on intermediate domains, to improve the overall target domain error. In this setting, our experimental results demonstrate that the original SAM outperforms the baseline of Adam on each of the experimental datasets by $0.82\%$ on average and the strongest SAM variants outperform Adam by $1.52\%$ on average. We then provide a generalization bound for SAM in the GDA setting. Asymptotically, this generalization bound is no better than the one for self-training in the literature of GDA. This highlights a further disconnection between the theoretical justification for SAM versus its empirical performance, with recent work finding that low sharpness alone does not account for all of SAM's generalization benefits. For future work, we provide several potential avenues for obtaining a tighter analysis for SAM in the OOD setting.</description>

      <title>Variational Encoder-Decoders for Learning Latent Representations of Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a deep-learning Variational Encoder-Decoder (VED) framework for learning data-driven low-dimensional representations of the relationship between high-dimensional parameters of a physical system and the system's high-dimensional observable response. The framework consists of two deep learning-based probabilistic transformations: An encoder mapping parameters to latent codes and a decoder mapping latent codes to the observable response. The hyperparameters of these transformations are identified by maximizing a variational lower bound on the log-conditional distribution of the observable response given parameters. To promote the disentanglement of latent codes, we equip this variational loss with a penalty on the off-diagonal entries of the aggregate distribution covariance of codes. This regularization penalty encourages the pushforward of a standard Gaussian distribution of latent codes to approximate the marginal distribution of the observable response.
  Using the proposed framework we successfully model the hydraulic pressure response at observation wells of a groundwater flow model as a function of its discrete log-hydraulic transmissivity field. Compared to the canonical correlation analysis encoding, the VED model achieves a lower-dimensional latent representation, with as low as $r = 50$ latent dimensions without a significant loss of reconstruction accuracy. We explore the impact of regularization on model performance, finding that KL-divergence and covariance regularization improve feature disentanglement in latent space while maintaining reconstruction accuracy. Furthermore, we evaluate the generative capabilities of the regularized model by decoding random Gaussian noise, revealing that tuning both $\beta$ and $\lambda$ parameters enhances the quality of the generated observable response data.</description>

      <title>Privacy Drift: Evolving Privacy Concerns in Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of machine learning (ML), Federated Learning (FL) presents a paradigm shift towards decentralized model training while preserving user data privacy. This paper introduces the concept of ``privacy drift", an innovative framework that parallels the well-known phenomenon of concept drift. While concept drift addresses the variability in model accuracy over time due to changes in the data, privacy drift encapsulates the variation in the leakage of private information as models undergo incremental training. By defining and examining privacy drift, this study aims to unveil the nuanced relationship between the evolution of model performance and the integrity of data privacy. Through rigorous experimentation, we investigate the dynamics of privacy drift in FL systems, focusing on how model updates and data distribution shifts influence the susceptibility of models to privacy attacks, such as membership inference attacks (MIA). Our results highlight a complex interplay between model accuracy and privacy safeguards, revealing that enhancements in model performance can lead to increased privacy risks. We provide empirical evidence from experiments on customized datasets derived from CIFAR-100 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, 100 classes), showcasing the impact of data and concept drift on privacy. This work lays the groundwork for future research on privacy-aware machine learning, aiming to achieve a delicate balance between model accuracy and data privacy in decentralized environments.</description>

      <title>One-shot Federated Learning via Synthetic Distiller-Distillate Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-shot Federated learning (FL) is a powerful technology facilitating collaborative training of machine learning models in a single round of communication. While its superiority lies in communication efficiency and privacy preservation compared to iterative FL, one-shot FL often compromises model performance. Prior research has primarily focused on employing data-free knowledge distillation to optimize data generators and ensemble models for better aggregating local knowledge into the server model. However, these methods typically struggle with data heterogeneity, where inconsistent local data distributions can cause teachers to provide misleading knowledge. Additionally, they may encounter scalability issues with complex datasets due to inherent two-step information loss: first, during local training (from data to model), and second, when transferring knowledge to the server model (from model to inversed data). In this paper, we propose FedSD2C, a novel and practical one-shot FL framework designed to address these challenges. FedSD2C introduces a distiller to synthesize informative distillates directly from local data to reduce information loss and proposes sharing synthetic distillates instead of inconsistent local models to tackle data heterogeneity. Our empirical results demonstrate that FedSD2C consistently outperforms other one-shot FL methods with more complex and real datasets, achieving up to 2.6 the performance of the best baseline.

      <title>Transformers Meet Relational Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer models have continuously expanded into all machine learning domains convertible to the underlying sequence-to-sequence representation, including tabular data. However, while ubiquitous, this representation restricts their extension to the more general case of relational databases. In this paper, we introduce a modular neural message-passing scheme that closely adheres to the formal relational model, enabling direct end-to-end learning of tabular Transformers from database storage systems. We address the challenges of appropriate learning data representation and loading, which are critical in the database setting, and compare our approach against a number of representative models from various related fields across a significantly wide range of datasets. Our results demonstrate a superior performance of this newly proposed class of neural architectures.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Foundation Models for Time Series Forecasting via Wavelet-based Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to best develop foundational models for time series forecasting remains an important open question. Tokenization is a crucial consideration in this effort: what is an effective discrete vocabulary for a real-valued sequential input? To address this question, we develop WaveToken, a wavelet-based tokenizer that allows models to learn complex representations directly in the space of time-localized frequencies. Our method first scales and decomposes the input time series, then thresholds and quantizes the wavelet coefficients, and finally pre-trains an autoregressive model to forecast coefficients for the forecast horizon. By decomposing coarse and fine structures in the inputs, wavelets provide an eloquent and compact language for time series forecasting that simplifies learning. Empirical results on a comprehensive benchmark, including 42 datasets for both in-domain and zero-shot settings, show that WaveToken: i) provides better accuracy than recently proposed foundation models for forecasting while using a much smaller vocabulary (1024 tokens), and performs on par or better than modern deep learning models trained specifically on each dataset; and ii) exhibits superior generalization capabilities, achieving the best average rank across all datasets for three complementary metrics. In addition, we show that our method can easily capture complex temporal patterns of practical relevance that are challenging for other recent pre-trained models, including trends, sparse spikes, and non-stationary time series with varying frequencies evolving over time.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for Transformer Models for Dark-Pattern Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The opaque nature of transformer-based models, particularly in applications susceptible to unethical practices such as dark-patterns in user interfaces, requires models that integrate uncertainty quantification to enhance trust in predictions. This study focuses on dark-pattern detection, deceptive design choices that manipulate user decisions, undermining autonomy and consent. We propose a differential fine-tuning approach implemented at the final classification head via uncertainty quantification with transformer-based pre-trained models. Employing a dense neural network (DNN) head architecture as a baseline, we examine two methods capable of quantifying uncertainty: Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Processes (SNGPs) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). These methods are evaluated on a set of open-source foundational models across multiple dimensions: model performance, variance in certainty of predictions and environmental impact during training and inference phases. Results demonstrate that integrating uncertainty quantification maintains performance while providing insights into challenging instances within the models. Moreover, the study reveals that the environmental impact does not uniformly increase with the incorporation of uncertainty quantification techniques. The study's findings demonstrate that uncertainty quantification enhances transparency and provides measurable confidence in predictions, improving the explainability and clarity of black-box models. This facilitates informed decision-making and mitigates the influence of dark-patterns on user interfaces. These results highlight the importance of incorporating uncertainty quantification techniques in developing machine learning models, particularly in domains where interpretability and trustworthiness are critical.</description>

      <title>Chimera: Accurate retrosynthesis prediction by ensembling models with diverse inductive biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planning and conducting chemical syntheses remains a major bottleneck in the discovery of functional small molecules, and prevents fully leveraging generative AI for molecular inverse design. While early work has shown that ML-based retrosynthesis models can predict reasonable routes, their low accuracy for less frequent, yet important reactions has been pointed out. As multi-step search algorithms are limited to reactions suggested by the underlying model, the applicability of those tools is inherently constrained by the accuracy of retrosynthesis prediction. Inspired by how chemists use different strategies to ideate reactions, we propose Chimera: a framework for building highly accurate reaction models that combine predictions from diverse sources with complementary inductive biases using a learning-based ensembling strategy. We instantiate the framework with two newly developed models, which already by themselves achieve state of the art in their categories. Through experiments across several orders of magnitude in data scale and time-splits, we show Chimera outperforms all major models by a large margin, owing both to the good individual performance of its constituents, but also to the scalability of our ensembling strategy. Moreover, we find that PhD-level organic chemists prefer predictions from Chimera over baselines in terms of quality. Finally, we transfer the largest-scale checkpoint to an internal dataset from a major pharmaceutical company, showing robust generalization under distribution shift. With the new dimension that our framework unlocks, we anticipate further acceleration in the development of even more accurate models.</description>

      <title>APOLLO: SGD-like Memory, AdamW-level Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are notoriously memory-intensive during training, particularly with the popular AdamW optimizer. This memory burden necessitates using more or higher-end GPUs or reducing batch sizes, limiting training scalability and throughput. To address this, various memory-efficient optimizers have been proposed to reduce optimizer memory usage. However, they face critical challenges: (i) reliance on costly SVD operations; (ii) significant performance trade-offs compared to AdamW; and (iii) still substantial optimizer memory overhead to maintain competitive performance.
  In this work, we identify that AdamW's learning rate adaptation rule can be effectively coarsened as a structured learning rate update. Based on this insight, we propose Approximated Gradient Scaling for Memory-Efficient LLM Optimization (APOLLO), which approximates learning rate scaling using an auxiliary low-rank optimizer state based on pure random projection. This structured learning rate update rule makes APOLLO highly tolerant to further memory reductions while delivering comparable pre-training performance. Even its rank-1 variant, APOLLO-Mini, achieves superior pre-training performance compared to AdamW with SGD-level memory costs.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that the APOLLO series performs on-par with or better than AdamW, while achieving greater memory savings by nearly eliminating the optimization states of AdamW. These savings provide significant system-level benefits: (1) Enhanced Throughput: 3x throughput on an 8xA100-80GB setup compared to AdamW by supporting 4x larger batch sizes. (2) Improved Model Scalability: Pre-training LLaMA-13B with naive DDP on A100-80GB GPUs without system-level optimizations. (3) Low-End GPU Friendly Pre-training: Pre-training LLaMA-7B on a single GPU using less than 12 GB of memory with weight quantization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the use of quantum generative adversarial networks QGANs for modeling eye movement velocity data. We assess whether the advanced computational capabilities of QGANs can enhance the modeling of complex stochastic distribution beyond the traditional mathematical models, particularly the Markov model. The findings indicate that while QGANs demonstrate potential in approximating complex distributions, the Markov model consistently outperforms in accurately replicating the real data distribution. This comparison underlines the challenges and avenues for refinement in time series data generation using quantum computing techniques. It emphasizes the need for further optimization of quantum models to better align with real-world data characteristics.</description>

      <title>Modeling Eye Gaze Velocity Trajectories using GANs with Spectral Loss for Enhanced Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of eye gaze dynamics is essential for advancement in human-computer interaction, neurological diagnostics, and cognitive research. Traditional generative models like Markov models often fail to capture the complex temporal dependencies and distributional nuance inherent in eye gaze trajectories data. This study introduces a GAN framework employing LSTM and CNN generators and discriminators to generate high-fidelity synthetic eye gaze velocity trajectories. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of four GAN architectures: CNN-CNN, LSTM-CNN, CNN-LSTM, and LSTM-LSTM trained under two conditions: using only adversarial loss and using a weighted combination of adversarial and spectral losses. Our findings reveal that the LSTM-CNN architecture trained with this new loss function exhibits the closest alignment to the real data distribution, effectively capturing both the distribution tails and the intricate temporal dependencies. The inclusion of spectral regularization significantly enhances the GANs ability to replicate the spectral characteristics of eye gaze movements, leading to a more stable learning process and improved data fidelity. Comparative analysis with an HMM optimized to four hidden states further highlights the advantages of the LSTM-CNN GAN. Statistical metrics show that the HMM-generated data significantly diverges from the real data in terms of mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. In contrast, the LSTM-CNN model closely matches the real data across these statistics, affirming its capacity to model the complexity of eye gaze dynamics effectively. These results position the spectrally regularized LSTM-CNN GAN as a robust tool for generating synthetic eye gaze velocity data with high fidelity.</description>

      <title>Advancing Marine Heatwave Forecasts: An Integrated Deep Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Marine heatwaves (MHWs), an extreme climate phenomenon, pose significant challenges to marine ecosystems and industries, with their frequency and intensity increasing due to climate change. This study introduces an integrated deep learning approach to forecast short-to-long-term MHWs on a global scale. The approach combines graph representation for modeling spatial properties in climate data, imbalanced regression to handle skewed data distributions, and temporal diffusion to enhance forecast accuracy across various lead times. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that synthesizes three spatiotemporal anomaly methodologies to predict MHWs. Additionally, we introduce a method for constructing graphs that avoids isolated nodes and provide a new publicly available sea surface temperature anomaly graph dataset. We examine the trade-offs in the selection of loss functions and evaluation metrics for MHWs. We analyze spatial patterns in global MHW predictability by focusing on historical hotspots, and our approach demonstrates better performance compared to traditional numerical models in regions such as the middle south Pacific, equatorial Atlantic near Africa, south Atlantic, and high-latitude Indian Ocean. We highlight the potential of temporal diffusion to replace the conventional sliding window approach for long-term forecasts, achieving improved prediction up to six months in advance. These insights not only establish benchmarks for machine learning applications in MHW forecasting but also enhance understanding of general climate forecasting methodologies.</description>

      <title>AI-powered Digital Framework for Personalized Economical Quality Learning at Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The disparity in access to quality education is significant, both between developed and developing countries and within nations, regardless of their economic status. Socioeconomic barriers and rapid changes in the job market further intensify this issue, highlighting the need for innovative solutions that can deliver quality education at scale and low cost. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing an AI-powered digital learning framework grounded in Deep Learning (DL) theory. The DL theory emphasizes learner agency and redefines the role of teachers as facilitators, making it particularly suitable for scalable educational environments. We outline eight key principles derived from learning science and AI that are essential for implementing DL-based Digital Learning Environments (DLEs). Our proposed framework leverages AI for learner modelling based on Open Learner Modeling (OLM), activity suggestions, and AI-assisted support for both learners and facilitators, fostering collaborative and engaging learning experiences. Our framework provides a promising direction for scalable, high-quality education globally, offering practical solutions to some of the AI-related challenges in education.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel algorithm for controlling linear time invariant systems in a tracking problem. The controller is based on a Gaussian Process (GP) whose realizations satisfy a system of linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients. Control inputs for tracking are determined by conditioning the prior GP on the setpoints, i.e. control as inference. The resulting Model Predictive Control scheme incorporates pointwise soft constraints by introducing virtual setpoints to the posterior Gaussian process. We show theoretically that our controller satisfies asymptotical stability for the optimal control problem by leveraging general results from Bayesian inference and demonstrate this result in a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Multi-Bin Batching for Increasing LLM Inference Throughput</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in popularity for their diverse capabilities, improving the efficiency of their inference systems has become increasingly critical. Batching LLM requests is a critical step in scheduling the inference jobs on servers (e.g. GPUs), enabling the system to maximize throughput by allowing multiple requests to be processed in parallel. However, requests often have varying generation lengths, causing resource underutilization, as hardware must wait for the longest-running request in the batch to complete before moving to the next batch. We formalize this problem from a queueing-theoretic perspective, and aim to design a control policy which is throughput-optimal. We propose Multi-Bin Batching, a simple yet effective method that can provably improve LLM inference throughput by grouping requests with similar (predicted) execution times into predetermined bins. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and experiments, including real-world LLM inference scenarios, we demonstrate significant throughput gains compared to standard batching approaches.</description>

      <title>Arctic-Embed 2.0: Multilingual Retrieval Without Compromise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the training methodology of Arctic-Embed 2.0, a set of open-source text embedding models built for accurate and efficient multilingual retrieval. While prior works have suffered from degraded English retrieval quality, Arctic-Embed 2.0 delivers competitive retrieval quality on multilingual and English-only benchmarks, and supports Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for efficient embedding storage with significantly lower compressed quality degradation compared to alternatives. We detail the design and implementation, presenting several important open research questions that arose during model development. We conduct experiments exploring these research questions and include extensive discussion aimed at fostering further discussion in this field.</description>

      <title>Prompting Large Language Models for Clinical Temporal Relation Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: This paper aims to prompt large language models (LLMs) for clinical temporal relation extraction (CTRE) in both few-shot and fully supervised settings. Materials and Methods: This study utilizes four LLMs: Encoder-based GatorTron-Base (345M)/Large (8.9B); Decoder-based LLaMA3-8B/MeLLaMA-13B. We developed full (FFT) and parameter-efficient (PEFT) fine-tuning strategies and evaluated these strategies on the 2012 i2b2 CTRE task. We explored four fine-tuning strategies for GatorTron-Base: (1) Standard Fine-Tuning, (2) Hard-Prompting with Unfrozen LLMs, (3) Soft-Prompting with Frozen LLMs, and (4) Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with Frozen LLMs. For GatorTron-Large, we assessed two PEFT strategies-Soft-Prompting and LoRA with Frozen LLMs-leveraging Quantization techniques. Additionally, LLaMA3-8B and MeLLaMA-13B employed two PEFT strategies: LoRA strategy with Quantization (QLoRA) applied to Frozen LLMs using instruction tuning and standard fine-tuning. Results: Under fully supervised settings, Hard-Prompting with Unfrozen GatorTron-Base achieved the highest F1 score (89.54%), surpassing the SOTA model (85.70%) by 3.74%. Additionally, two variants of QLoRA adapted to GatorTron-Large and Standard Fine-Tuning of GatorTron-Base exceeded the SOTA model by 2.36%, 1.88%, and 0.25%, respectively. Decoder-based models with frozen parameters outperformed their Encoder-based counterparts in this setting; however, the trend reversed in few-shot scenarios. Discussions and Conclusions: This study presented new methods that significantly improved CTRE performance, benefiting downstream tasks reliant on CTRE systems. The findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate models and fine-tuning strategies based on task requirements and data availability. Future work will explore larger models and broader CTRE applications.</description>

      <title>Labeling questions inside issue trackers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the issues faced by the maintainers of popular open source software is the triage of newly reported issues. Many of the issues submitted to issue trackers are questions. Many people ask questions on issue trackers about their problem instead of using a proper QA website like StackOverflow. This may seem insignificant but for many of the big projects with thousands of users, this leads to spamming of the issue tracker. Reading and labeling these unrelated issues manually is a serious time consuming task and these unrelated questions add to the burden. In fact, most often maintainers demand to not submit questions in the issue tracker. To address this problem, first, we leveraged dozens of patterns to clean text of issues, we removed noises like logs, stack traces, environment variables, error messages, etc. Second, we have implemented a classification-based approach to automatically label unrelated questions. Empirical evaluations on a dataset of more than 102,000 records show that our approach can label questions with an accuracy of over 81%.</description>

      <title>MageBench: Bridging Large Multimodal Models to Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LMMs have shown impressive visual understanding capabilities, with the potential to be applied in agents, which demand strong reasoning and planning abilities. Nevertheless, existing benchmarks mostly assess their reasoning abilities in language part, where the chain-of-thought is entirely composed of text.We consider the scenario where visual signals are continuously updated and required along the decision making process. Such vision-in-the-chain reasoning paradigm is more aligned with the needs of multimodal agents, while being rarely evaluated. In this paper, we introduce MageBench, a reasoning capability oriented multimodal agent benchmark that, while having light-weight environments, poses significant reasoning challenges and holds substantial practical value. This benchmark currently includes three types of environments: WebUI, Sokoban, and Football, comprising a total of 483 different scenarios. It thoroughly validates the agent's knowledge and engineering capabilities, visual intelligence, and interaction skills. The results show that only a few product-level models are better than random acting, and all of them are far inferior to human-level. More specifically, we found current models severely lack the ability to modify their planning based on visual feedback, as well as visual imagination, interleaved image-text long context handling, and other abilities. We hope that our work will provide optimization directions for LMM from the perspective of being an agent. We release our code and data at https://github.com/microsoft/MageBench.</description>

      <title>Understanding Hidden Computations in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly enhanced the reasoning abilities of large language models. However, recent studies have shown that models can still perform complex reasoning tasks even when the CoT is replaced with filler(hidden) characters (e.g., "..."), leaving open questions about how models internally process and represent reasoning steps. In this paper, we investigate methods to decode these hidden characters in transformer models trained with filler CoT sequences. By analyzing layer-wise representations using the logit lens method and examining token rankings, we demonstrate that the hidden characters can be recovered without loss of performance. Our findings provide insights into the internal mechanisms of transformer models and open avenues for improving interpretability and transparency in language model reasoning.</description>

      <title>Machine learning approach for mapping the stable orbits around planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical N-body simulations are commonly used to explore stability regions around exoplanets, offering insights into the possible existence of satellites and ring systems. This study aims to utilize Machine Learning (ML) techniques to generate predictive maps of stable regions surrounding a hypothetical planet. The approach can also be extended to planet-satellite systems, planetary ring systems, and other similar configurations. A dataset was generated using 10^5 numerical simulations, each incorporating nine orbital features for the planet and a test particle in a star-planet-test particle system. The simulations were classified as stable or unstable based on stability criteria, requiring particles to remain stable over a timespan equivalent to 10,000 orbital periods of the planet. Various ML algorithms were tested and fine-tuned through hyperparameter optimization to determine the most effective predictive model. Tree-based algorithms showed comparable accuracy in performance. The best-performing model, using the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, achieved an accuracy of 98.48%, with 94% recall and precision for stable particles and 99% for unstable particles. ML algorithms significantly reduce the computational time required for three-body simulations, operating approximately 100,000 times faster than traditional numerical methods. Predictive models can generate entire stability maps in less than a second, compared to the days required by numerical simulations. The results from the trained ML models will be made accessible through a public web interface, enabling broader scientific applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores transformer-based models for music overpainting, focusing on jazz piano variations. Music overpainting generates new variations while preserving the melodic and harmonic structure of the input. Existing approaches are limited by small datasets, restricting scalability and diversity. We introduce VAR4000, a subset of a larger dataset for jazz piano performances, consisting of 4,352 training pairs. Using a semi-automatic pipeline, we evaluate two transformer configurations on VAR4000, comparing their performance with the smaller JAZZVAR dataset. Preliminary results show promising improvements in generalisation and performance with the larger dataset configuration, highlighting the potential of transformer models to scale effectively for music overpainting on larger and more diverse datasets.</description>

      <title>Mixed Delay/Nondelay Embeddings Based Neuromorphic Computing with Patterned Nanomagnet Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patterned nanomagnet arrays (PNAs) have been shown to exhibit a strong geometrically frustrated dipole interaction. Some PNAs have also shown emergent domain wall dynamics. Previous works have demonstrated methods to physically probe these magnetization dynamics of PNAs to realize neuromorphic reservoir systems that exhibit chaotic dynamical behavior and high-dimensional nonlinearity. These PNA reservoir systems from prior works leverage echo state properties and linear/nonlinear short-term memory of component reservoir nodes to map and preserve the dynamical information of the input time-series data into nondelay spatial embeddings. Such mappings enable these PNA reservoir systems to imitate and predict/forecast the input time series data. However, these prior PNA reservoir systems are based solely on the nondelay spatial embeddings obtained at component reservoir nodes. As a result, they require a massive number of component reservoir nodes, or a very large spatial embedding (i.e., high-dimensional spatial embedding) per reservoir node, or both, to achieve acceptable imitation and prediction accuracy. These requirements reduce the practical feasibility of such PNA reservoir systems. To address this shortcoming, we present a mixed delay/nondelay embeddings-based PNA reservoir system. Our system uses a single PNA reservoir node with the ability to obtain a mixture of delay/nondelay embeddings of the dynamical information of the time-series data applied at the input of a single PNA reservoir node. Our analysis shows that when these mixed delay/nondelay embeddings are used to train a perceptron at the output layer, our reservoir system outperforms existing PNA-based reservoir systems for the imitation of NARMA 2, NARMA 5, NARMA 7, and NARMA 10 time series data, and for the short-term and long-term prediction of the Mackey Glass time series data.</description>

Abstract: In product search, the retrieval of candidate products before re-ranking is more critical and challenging than other search like web search, especially for tail queries, which have a complex and specific search intent. In this paper, we present a hybrid system for e-commerce search deployed at Walmart that combines traditional inverted index and embedding-based neural retrieval to better answer user tail queries. Our system significantly improved the relevance of the search engine, measured by both offline and online evaluations. The improvements were achieved through a combination of different approaches. We present a new technique to train the neural model at scale. and describe how the system was deployed in production with little impact on response time. We highlight multiple learnings and practical tricks that were used in the deployment of this system.</description>

      <title>Hidden in the Noise: Two-Stage Robust Watermarking for Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the quality of image generators continues to improve, deepfakes become a topic of considerable societal debate. Image watermarking allows responsible model owners to detect and label their AI-generated content, which can mitigate the harm. Yet, current state-of-the-art methods in image watermarking remain vulnerable to forgery and removal attacks. This vulnerability occurs in part because watermarks distort the distribution of generated images, unintentionally revealing information about the watermarking techniques.
  In this work, we first demonstrate a distortion-free watermarking method for images, based on a diffusion model's initial noise. However, detecting the watermark requires comparing the initial noise reconstructed for an image to all previously used initial noises. To mitigate these issues, we propose a two-stage watermarking framework for efficient detection. During generation, we augment the initial noise with generated Fourier patterns to embed information about the group of initial noises we used. For detection, we (i) retrieve the relevant group of noises, and (ii) search within the given group for an initial noise that might match our image. This watermarking approach achieves state-of-the-art robustness to forgery and removal against a large battery of attacks.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Model Maintenance Approach for MLOps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, many industries have utilized machine learning models (ML) in their systems. Ideally, machine learning models should be trained on and applied to data from the same distributions. However, the data evolves over time in many application areas, leading to data and concept drift, which in turn causes the performance of the ML models to degrade over time. Therefore, maintaining up to date ML models plays a critical role in the MLOps pipeline. Existing ML model maintenance approaches are often computationally resource intensive, costly, time consuming, and model dependent. Thus, we propose an improved MLOps pipeline, a new model maintenance approach and a Similarity Based Model Reuse (SimReuse) tool to address the challenges of ML model maintenance. We identify seasonal and recurrent distribution patterns in time series datasets throughout a preliminary study. Recurrent distribution patterns enable us to reuse previously trained models for similar distributions in the future, thus avoiding frequent retraining. Then, we integrated the model reuse approach into the MLOps pipeline and proposed our improved MLOps pipeline. Furthermore, we develop SimReuse, a tool to implement the new components of our MLOps pipeline to store models and reuse them for inference of data segments with similar data distributions in the future. Our evaluation results on four time series datasets demonstrate that our model reuse approach can maintain the performance of models while significantly reducing maintenance time and costs. Our model reuse approach achieves ML performance comparable to the best baseline, while being 15 times more efficient in terms of computation time and costs. Therefore, industries and practitioners can benefit from our approach and use our tool to maintain the performance of their ML models in the deployment phase to reduce their maintenance costs.</description>

      <title>Learning for Layered Safety-Critical Control with Predictive Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety filters leveraging control barrier functions (CBFs) are highly effective for enforcing safe behavior on complex systems. It is often easier to synthesize CBFs for a Reduced order Model (RoM), and track the resulting safe behavior on the Full order Model (FoM) -- yet gaps between the RoM and FoM can result in safety violations. This paper introduces \emph{predictive CBFs} to address this gap by leveraging rollouts of the FoM to define a predictive robustness term added to the RoM CBF condition. Theoretically, we prove that this guarantees safety in a layered control implementation. Practically, we learn the predictive robustness term through massive parallel simulation with domain randomization. We demonstrate in simulation that this yields safe FoM behavior with minimal conservatism, and experimentally realize predictive CBFs on a 3D hopping robot.</description>

      <title>Smoothie: Label Free Language Model Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications where LLM inputs may span many different tasks. Recent work has found that the choice of LLM is consequential, and different LLMs may be good for different input samples. Prior approaches have thus explored how engineers might select an LLM to use for each sample (i.e. routing). While existing routing methods mostly require training auxiliary models on human-annotated data, our work explores whether it is possible to perform unsupervised routing. We propose Smoothie, a weak supervision-inspired routing approach that requires no labeled data. Given a set of outputs from different LLMs, Smoothie constructs a latent variable graphical model over embedding representations of observable LLM outputs and unknown "true" outputs. Using this graphical model, we estimate sample-dependent quality scores for each LLM, and route each sample to the LLM with the highest corresponding score. We find that Smoothie's LLM quality-scores correlate with ground-truth model quality (correctly identifying the optimal model on 9/14 tasks), and that Smoothie outperforms baselines for routing by up to 10 points accuracy.</description>

      <title>Transformers Struggle to Learn to Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Search is an ability foundational in many important tasks, and recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) struggle to perform search robustly. It is unknown whether this inability is due to a lack of data, insufficient model parameters, or fundamental limitations of the transformer architecture. In this work, we use the foundational graph connectivity problem as a testbed to generate effectively limitless high-coverage data to train small transformers and test whether they can learn to perform search. We find that, when given the right training distribution, the transformer is able to learn to search.
  We analyze the algorithm that the transformer has learned through a novel mechanistic interpretability technique that enables us to extract the computation graph from the trained model. We find that for each vertex in the input graph, transformers compute the set of vertices reachable from that vertex. Each layer then progressively expands these sets, allowing the model to search over a number of vertices exponential in the number of layers.
  However, we find that as the input graph size increases, the transformer has greater difficulty in learning the task. This difficulty is not resolved even as the number of parameters is increased, suggesting that increasing model scale will not lead to robust search abilities. We also find that performing search in-context (i.e., chain-of-thought) does not resolve this inability to learn to search on larger graphs.</description>

      <title>Machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of rupture of intracranial aneurysms: a systematic review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Subarachnoid haemorrhage is a potentially fatal consequence of intracranial aneurysm rupture, however, it is difficult to predict if aneurysms will rupture. Prophylactic treatment of an intracranial aneurysm also involves risk, hence identifying rupture-prone aneurysms is of substantial clinical importance. This systematic review aims to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms for predicting intracranial aneurysm rupture risk.
  Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched until December 2023. Studies incorporating any machine learning algorithm to predict the risk of rupture of an intracranial aneurysm were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). PROSPERO registration: CRD42023452509. Results: Out of 10,307 records screened, 20 studies met the eligibility criteria for this review incorporating a total of 20,286 aneurysm cases. The machine learning models gave a 0.66-0.90 range for performance accuracy. The models were compared to current clinical standards in six studies and gave mixed results. Most studies posed high or unclear risks of bias and concerns for applicability, limiting the inferences that can be drawn from them. There was insufficient homogenous data for a meta-analysis.
  Conclusions: Machine learning can be applied to predict the risk of rupture for intracranial aneurysms. However, the evidence does not comprehensively demonstrate superiority to existing practice, limiting its role as a clinical adjunct. Further prospective multicentre studies of recent machine learning tools are needed to prove clinical validation before they are implemented in the clinic.</description>

      <title>Ltri-LLM: Streaming Long Context Inference for LLMs with Training-Free Dynamic Triangular Attention Pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanism in current Large Language Models (LLMs) renders inference with long contexts prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, various approaches aim to retain critical portions of the context to optimally approximate Full Attention (FA) through Key-Value (KV) compression or Sparse Attention (SA), enabling the processing of virtually unlimited text lengths in a streaming manner. However, these methods struggle to achieve performance levels comparable to FA, particularly in retrieval tasks. In this paper, our analysis of attention head patterns reveals that LLMs' attention distributions show strong local correlations, naturally reflecting a chunking mechanism for input context. We propose Ltri-LLM framework, which divides KVs into spans, stores them in an offline index, and retrieves the relevant KVs into memory for various queries. Experimental results on popular long text benchmarks show that Ltri-LLM can achieve performance close to FA while maintaining efficient, streaming-based inference.</description>

      <title>Measuring Goal-Directedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define maximum entropy goal-directedness (MEG), a formal measure of goal-directedness in causal models and Markov decision processes, and give algorithms for computing it. Measuring goal-directedness is important, as it is a critical element of many concerns about harm from AI. It is also of philosophical interest, as goal-directedness is a key aspect of agency. MEG is based on an adaptation of the maximum causal entropy framework used in inverse reinforcement learning. It can measure goal-directedness with respect to a known utility function, a hypothesis class of utility functions, or a set of random variables. We prove that MEG satisfies several desiderata and demonstrate our algorithms with small-scale experiments.</description>

      <title>Short-term Streamflow and Flood Forecasting based on Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network and Residual Error Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate short-term streamflow and flood forecasting are critical for mitigating river flood impacts, especially given the increasing climate variability. Machine learning-based streamflow forecasting relies on large streamflow datasets derived from rating curves. Uncertainties in rating curve modeling could introduce errors to the streamflow data and affect the forecasting accuracy. This study proposes a streamflow forecasting method that addresses these data errors, enhancing the accuracy of river flood forecasting and flood modeling, thereby reducing flood-related risk. A convolutional recurrent neural network is used to capture spatiotemporal patterns, coupled with residual error learning and forecasting. The neural network outperforms commonly used forecasting models over 1-6 hours of forecasting horizons, and the residual error learners can further correct the residual errors. This provides a more reliable tool for river flood forecasting and climate adaptation in this critical 1-6 hour time window for flood risk mitigation efforts.</description>

      <title>DAWN-SI: Data-Aware and Noise-Informed Stochastic Interpolation for Solving Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems, which involve estimating parameters from incomplete or noisy observations, arise in various fields such as medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing. These problems are often ill-posed, requiring regularization techniques to stabilize the solution. In this work, we employ $\textit{Stochastic Interpolation}$ (SI), a generative framework that integrates both deterministic and stochastic processes to map a simple reference distribution, such as a Gaussian, to the target distribution. Our method $\textbf{DAWN-SI}$: $\textbf{D}$ata-$\textbf{AW}$are and $\textbf{N}$oise-informed $\textbf{S}$tochastic $\textbf{I}$nterpolation incorporates data and noise embedding, allowing the model to access representations about the measured data explicitly and also account for noise in the observations, making it particularly robust in scenarios where data is noisy or incomplete. By learning a time-dependent velocity field, SI not only provides accurate solutions but also enables uncertainty quantification by generating multiple plausible outcomes. Unlike pre-trained diffusion models, which may struggle in highly ill-posed settings, our approach is trained specifically for each inverse problem and adapts to varying noise levels. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method through extensive numerical experiments on tasks such as image deblurring and tomography.</description>

      <title>NLP-ADBench: NLP Anomaly Detection Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is a critical machine learning task with diverse applications in web systems, including fraud detection, content moderation, and user behavior analysis. Despite its significance, AD in natural language processing (NLP) remains underexplored, limiting advancements in detecting anomalies in text data such as harmful content, phishing attempts, or spam reviews. In this paper, we introduce NLP-ADBench, the most comprehensive benchmark for NLP anomaly detection (NLP-AD), comprising eight curated datasets and evaluations of nineteen state-of-the-art algorithms. These include three end-to-end methods and sixteen two-step algorithms that apply traditional anomaly detection techniques to language embeddings generated by bert-base-uncased and OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large models.
  Our results reveal critical insights and future directions for NLP-AD. Notably, no single model excels across all datasets, highlighting the need for automated model selection. Moreover, two-step methods leveraging transformer-based embeddings consistently outperform specialized end-to-end approaches, with OpenAI embeddings demonstrating superior performance over BERT embeddings. By releasing NLP-ADBench at https://github.com/USC-FORTIS/NLP-ADBench, we provide a standardized framework for evaluating NLP-AD methods, fostering the development of innovative approaches. This work fills a crucial gap in the field and establishes a foundation for advancing NLP anomaly detection, particularly in the context of improving the safety and reliability of web-based systems.</description>

      <title>Slicing Vision Transformer for Flexible Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViT) is known for its scalability. In this work, we target to scale down a ViT to fit in an environment with dynamic-changing resource constraints. We observe that smaller ViTs are intrinsically the sub-networks of a larger ViT with different widths. Thus, we propose a general framework, named Scala, to enable a single network to represent multiple smaller ViTs with flexible inference capability, which aligns with the inherent design of ViT to vary from widths. Concretely, Scala activates several subnets during training, introduces Isolated Activation to disentangle the smallest sub-network from other subnets, and leverages Scale Coordination to ensure each sub-network receives simplified, steady, and accurate learning objectives. Comprehensive empirical validations on different tasks demonstrate that with only one-shot training, Scala learns slimmable representation without modifying the original ViT structure and matches the performance of Separate Training. Compared with the prior art, Scala achieves an average improvement of 1.6% on ImageNet-1K with fewer parameters.</description>

      <title>WRF-GS: Wireless Radiation Field Reconstruction with 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless channel modeling plays a pivotal role in designing, analyzing, and optimizing wireless communication systems. Nevertheless, developing an effective channel modeling approach has been a longstanding challenge. This issue has been escalated due to the denser network deployment, larger antenna arrays, and wider bandwidth in 5G and beyond networks. To address this challenge, we put forth WRF-GS, a novel framework for channel modeling based on wireless radiation field (WRF) reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting. WRF-GS employs 3D Gaussian primitives and neural networks to capture the interactions between the environment and radio signals, enabling efficient WRF reconstruction and visualization of the propagation characteristics. The reconstructed WRF can then be used to synthesize the spatial spectrum for comprehensive wireless channel characterization. Notably, with a small number of measurements, WRF-GS can synthesize new spatial spectra within milliseconds for a given scene, thereby enabling latency-sensitive applications. Experimental results demonstrate that WRF-GS outperforms existing methods for spatial spectrum synthesis, such as ray tracing and other deep-learning approaches. Moreover, WRF-GS achieves superior performance in the channel state information prediction task, surpassing existing methods by a significant margin of more than 2.43 dB.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Alignment with Minimal Feedback: Efficiently Learning Rewards for Visuomotor Robot Policy Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visuomotor robot policies, increasingly pre-trained on large-scale datasets, promise significant advancements across robotics domains. However, aligning these policies with end-user preferences remains a challenge, particularly when the preferences are hard to specify. While reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become the predominant mechanism for alignment in non-embodied domains like large language models, it has not seen the same success in aligning visuomotor policies due to the prohibitive amount of human feedback required to learn visual reward functions. To address this limitation, we propose Representation-Aligned Preference-based Learning (RAPL), an observation-only method for learning visual rewards from significantly less human preference feedback. Unlike traditional RLHF, RAPL focuses human feedback on fine-tuning pre-trained vision encoders to align with the end-user's visual representation and then constructs a dense visual reward via feature matching in this aligned representation space. We first validate RAPL through simulation experiments in the X-Magical benchmark and Franka Panda robotic manipulation, demonstrating that it can learn rewards aligned with human preferences, more efficiently uses preference data, and generalizes across robot embodiments. Finally, our hardware experiments align pre-trained Diffusion Policies for three object manipulation tasks. We find that RAPL can fine-tune these policies with 5x less real human preference data, taking the first step towards minimizing human feedback while maximizing visuomotor robot policy alignment.</description>

      <title>eXpath: Explaining Knowledge Graph Link Prediction with Ontological Closed Path Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Link prediction (LP) is crucial for Knowledge Graphs (KG) completion but commonly suffers from interpretability issues. While several methods have been proposed to explain embedding-based LP models, they are generally limited to local explanations on KG and are deficient in providing human interpretable semantics. Based on real-world observations of the characteristics of KGs from multiple domains, we propose to explain LP models in KG with path-based explanations. An integrated framework, namely eXpath, is introduced which incorporates the concept of relation path with ontological closed path rules to enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of LP interpretation. Notably, the eXpath explanations can be fused with other single-link explanation approaches to achieve a better overall solution. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and LP models demonstrate that introducing eXpath can boost the quality of resulting explanations by about 20% on two key metrics and reduce the required explanation time by 61.4%, in comparison to the best existing method. Case studies further highlight eXpath's ability to provide more semantically meaningful explanations through path-based evidence.</description>

      <title>MTSpark: Enabling Multi-Task Learning with Spiking Neural Networks for Generalist Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, state-of-the-art RL methods excel in single-task settings, but they still struggle to generalize across multiple tasks due to catastrophic forgetting challenges, where previously learned tasks are forgotten as new tasks are introduced. This multi-task learning capability is significantly important for generalist agents, where adaptation features are highly required (e.g., autonomous robots). On the other hand, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as alternative energy-efficient neural network algorithms due to their sparse spike-based operations. Toward this, we propose MTSpark, a novel methodology to enable multi-task RL using spiking networks. Specifically, MTSpark develops a Deep Spiking Q-Network (DSQN) with active dendrites and dueling structure by leveraging task-specific context signals. Specifically, each neuron computes task-dependent activations that dynamically modulate inputs, forming specialized sub-networks for each task. Moreover, this bioplausible network model also benefits from SNNs, enhancing energy efficiency and making the model suitable for hardware implementation. Experimental results show that, our MTSpark effectively learns multiple tasks with higher performance compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically, MTSpark successfully achieves high score in three Atari games (i.e., Pong: -5.4, Breakout: 0.6, and Enduro: 371.2), reaching human-level performance (i.e., Pong: -3, Breakout: 31, and Enduro: 368), where state-of-the-art struggle to achieve. In addition, our MTSpark also shows better accuracy in image classification tasks than the state-of-the-art. These results highlight the potential of our MTSpark methodology to develop generalist agents that can learn multiple tasks by leveraging both RL and SNN concepts.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Instance-Dependent Label Noise: Integrating Self-Supervised Pretraining with Pseudo-Label Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models rely heavily on large volumes of labeled data to achieve high performance. However, real-world datasets often contain noisy labels due to human error, ambiguity, or resource constraints during the annotation process. Instance-dependent label noise (IDN), where the probability of a label being corrupted depends on the input features, poses a significant challenge because it is more prevalent and harder to address than instance-independent noise. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid framework that combines self-supervised learning using SimCLR with iterative pseudo-label refinement to mitigate the effects of IDN. The self-supervised pre-training phase enables the model to learn robust feature representations without relying on potentially noisy labels, establishing a noise-agnostic foundation. Subsequently, we employ an iterative training process with pseudo-label refinement, where confidently predicted samples are identified through a multistage approach and their labels are updated to improve label quality progressively. We evaluate our method on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets augmented with synthetic instance-dependent noise at varying noise levels. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, particularly under high noise conditions, achieving notable improvements in classification accuracy and robustness. Our findings suggest that integrating self-supervised learning with iterative pseudo-label refinement offers an effective strategy for training deep neural networks on noisy datasets afflicted by instance-dependent label noise.</description>

      <title>EACO: Enhancing Alignment in Multimodal LLMs via Critical Observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on various visual question answering and reasoning tasks leveraging instruction fine-tuning specific datasets. They can also learn from preference data annotated by human to enhance their reasoning ability and mitigate hallucinations. Most of preference data is generated from the model itself. However, existing methods require high-quality critical labels, which are costly and rely on human or proprietary models like GPT-4V. In this work, we propose Enhancing Alignment in MLLMs via Critical Observation (EACO), which aligns MLLMs by self-generated preference data using only 5k images economically. Our approach begins with collecting and refining a Scoring Evaluation Instruction-tuning dataset to train a critical evaluation model, termed the Critic. This Critic observes model responses across multiple dimensions, selecting preferred and non-preferred outputs for refined Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) tuning. To further enhance model performance, we employ an additional supervised fine-tuning stage after preference tuning. EACO reduces the overall hallucinations by 65.6% on HallusionBench and improves the reasoning ability by 21.8% on MME-Cognition. EACO achieves an 8.5% improvement over LLaVA-v1.6-Mistral-7B across multiple benchmarks. Remarkably, EACO also shows the potential critical ability in open-source MLLMs, demonstrating that EACO is a viable path to boost the competence of MLLMs.</description>

      <title>DEMO: Reframing Dialogue Interaction with Fine-grained Element Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made dialogue one of the central modes of human-machine interaction, leading to the accumulation of vast amounts of conversation logs and increasing demand for dialogue generation. A conversational life-cycle spans from the Prelude through the Interlocution to the Epilogue, encompassing various elements. Despite the existence of numerous dialogue-related studies, there is a lack of benchmarks that encompass comprehensive dialogue elements, hindering precise modeling and systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce an innovative research task $\textbf{D}$ialogue $\textbf{E}$lement $\textbf{MO}$deling, including $\textit{Element Awareness}$ and $\textit{Dialogue Agent Interaction}$, and propose a novel benchmark, $\textbf{DEMO}$, designed for a comprehensive dialogue modeling and assessment. Inspired by imitation learning, we further build the agent which possesses the adept ability to model dialogue elements based on the DEMO benchmark. Extensive experiments indicate that existing LLMs still exhibit considerable potential for enhancement, and our DEMO agent has superior performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.</description>

      <title>Continuous Video Process: Modeling Videos as Continuous Multi-Dimensional Processes for Video Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have made significant strides in image generation, mastering tasks such as unconditional image synthesis, text-image translation, and image-to-image conversions. However, their capability falls short in the realm of video prediction, mainly because they treat videos as a collection of independent images, relying on external constraints such as temporal attention mechanisms to enforce temporal coherence. In our paper, we introduce a novel model class, that treats video as a continuous multi-dimensional process rather than a series of discrete frames. We also report a reduction of 75\% sampling steps required to sample a new frame thus making our framework more efficient during the inference time. Through extensive experimentation, we establish state-of-the-art performance in video prediction, validated on benchmark datasets including KTH, BAIR, Human3.6M, and UCF101.

      <title>Video Decomposition Prior: A Methodology to Decompose Videos into Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of video enhancement and editing methodologies, a majority of deep learning techniques often rely on extensive datasets of observed input and ground truth sequence pairs for optimal performance. Such reliance often falters when acquiring data becomes challenging, especially in tasks like video dehazing and relighting, where replicating identical motions and camera angles in both corrupted and ground truth sequences is complicated. Moreover, these conventional methodologies perform best when the test distribution closely mirrors the training distribution. Recognizing these challenges, this paper introduces a novel video decomposition prior `\texttt{VDP}' framework which derives inspiration from professional video editing practices. Our methodology does not mandate task-specific external data corpus collection, instead pivots to utilizing the motion and appearance of the input video. \texttt{VDP} framework decomposes a video sequence into a set of multiple RGB layers and associated opacity levels. These set of layers are then manipulated individually to obtain the desired results. We addresses tasks such as video object segmentation, dehazing, and relighting. Moreover, we introduce a novel logarithmic video decomposition formulation for video relighting tasks, setting a new benchmark over the existing methodologies. We observe the property of relighting emerge as we optimize for our novel relighting decomposition formulation. We evaluate our approach on standard video datasets like DAVIS, REVIDE, \&amp; SDSD and show qualitative results on a diverse array of internet videos.

      <title>Probing the contents of semantic representations from text, behavior, and brain data using the psychNorms metabase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic representations are integral to natural language processing, psycholinguistics, and artificial intelligence. Although often derived from internet text, recent years have seen a rise in the popularity of behavior-based (e.g., free associations) and brain-based (e.g., fMRI) representations, which promise improvements in our ability to measure and model human representations. We carry out the first systematic evaluation of the similarities and differences between semantic representations derived from text, behavior, and brain data. Using representational similarity analysis, we show that word vectors derived from behavior and brain data encode information that differs from their text-derived cousins. Furthermore, drawing on our psychNorms metabase, alongside an interpretability method that we call representational content analysis, we find that, in particular, behavior representations capture unique variance on certain affective, agentic, and socio-moral dimensions. We thus establish behavior as an important complement to text for capturing human representations and behavior. These results are broadly relevant to research aimed at learning human-aligned semantic representations, including work on evaluating and aligning large language models.</description>

      <title>Gla-AI4BioMed at RRG24: Visual Instruction-tuned Adaptation for Radiology Report Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a radiology-focused visual language model designed to generate radiology reports from chest X-rays. Building on previous findings that large language models (LLMs) can acquire multimodal capabilities when aligned with pretrained vision encoders, we demonstrate similar potential with chest X-ray images. This integration enhances the ability of model to understand and describe chest X-ray images. Our model combines an image encoder with a fine-tuned LLM based on the Vicuna-7B architecture, enabling it to generate different sections of a radiology report with notable accuracy. The training process involves a two-stage approach: (i) initial alignment of chest X-ray features with the LLM (ii) followed by fine-tuning for radiology report generation.</description>

      <title>Frontier Models are Capable of In-context Scheming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frontier models are increasingly trained and deployed as autonomous agent. One safety concern is that AI agents might covertly pursue misaligned goals, hiding their true capabilities and objectives - also known as scheming. We study whether models have the capability to scheme in pursuit of a goal that we provide in-context and instruct the model to strongly follow. We evaluate frontier models on a suite of six agentic evaluations where models are instructed to pursue goals and are placed in environments that incentivize scheming. Our results show that o1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Llama 3.1 405B all demonstrate in-context scheming capabilities. They recognize scheming as a viable strategy and readily engage in such behavior. For example, models strategically introduce subtle mistakes into their responses, attempt to disable their oversight mechanisms, and even exfiltrate what they believe to be their model weights to external servers. Additionally, this deceptive behavior proves persistent. When o1 has engaged in scheming, it maintains its deception in over 85% of follow-up questions and often remains deceptive in multi-turn interrogations. Analysis of the models' chains-of-thought reveals that models explicitly reason about these deceptive strategies, providing evidence that the scheming behavior is not accidental. Surprisingly, we also find rare instances where models engage in scheming when only given a goal, without being strongly nudged to pursue it. We observe cases where Claude 3.5 Sonnet strategically underperforms in evaluations in pursuit of being helpful, a goal that was acquired during training rather than in-context. Our findings demonstrate that frontier models now possess capabilities for basic in-context scheming, making the potential of AI agents to engage in scheming behavior a concrete rather than theoretical concern.</description>

      <title>ReF-LDM: A Latent Diffusion Model for Reference-based Face Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While recent works on blind face image restoration have successfully produced impressive high-quality (HQ) images with abundant details from low-quality (LQ) input images, the generated content may not accurately reflect the real appearance of a person. To address this problem, incorporating well-shot personal images as additional reference inputs could be a promising strategy. Inspired by the recent success of the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), we propose ReF-LDM, an adaptation of LDM designed to generate HQ face images conditioned on one LQ image and multiple HQ reference images. Our model integrates an effective and efficient mechanism, CacheKV, to leverage the reference images during the generation process. Additionally, we design a timestep-scaled identity loss, enabling our LDM-based model to focus on learning the discriminating features of human faces. Lastly, we construct FFHQ-Ref, a dataset consisting of 20,405 high-quality (HQ) face images with corresponding reference images, which can serve as both training and evaluation data for reference-based face restoration models.</description>

      <title>Integrating Semantic Communication and Human Decision-Making into an End-to-End Sensing-Decision Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As early as 1949, Weaver defined communication in a very broad sense to include all procedures by which one mind or technical system can influence another, thus establishing the idea of semantic communication. With the recent success of machine learning in expert assistance systems where sensed information is wirelessly provided to a human to assist task execution, the need to design effective and efficient communications has become increasingly apparent. In particular, semantic communication aims to convey the meaning behind the sensed information relevant for Human Decision-Making (HDM). Regarding the interplay between semantic communication and HDM, many questions remain, such as how to model the entire end-to-end sensing-decision-making process, how to design semantic communication for the HDM and which information should be provided to the HDM. To address these questions, we propose to integrate semantic communication and HDM into one probabilistic end-to-end sensing-decision framework that bridges communications and psychology. In our interdisciplinary framework, we model the human through a HDM process, allowing us to explore how feature extraction from semantic communication can best support human decision-making. In this sense, our study provides new insights for the design/interaction of semantic communication with models of HDM. Our initial analysis shows how semantic communication can balance the level of detail with human cognitive capabilities while demanding less bandwidth, power, and latency.</description>

      <title>Dirac-Equation Signal Processing: Physics Boosts Topological Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological signals are variables or features associated with both nodes and edges of a network. Recently, in the context of Topological Machine Learning, great attention has been devoted to signal processing of such topological signals. Most of the previous topological signal processing algorithms treat node and edge signals separately and work under the hypothesis that the true signal is smooth and/or well approximated by a harmonic eigenvector of the Hodge-Laplacian, which may be violated in practice. Here we propose Dirac-equation signal processing, a framework for efficiently reconstructing true signals on nodes and edges, also if they are not smooth or harmonic, by processing them jointly. The proposed physics-inspired algorithm is based on the spectral properties of the topological Dirac operator. It leverages the mathematical structure of the topological Dirac equation to boost the performance of the signal processing algorithm. We discuss how the relativistic dispersion relation obeyed by the topological Dirac equation can be used to assess the quality of the signal reconstruction. Finally, we demonstrate the improved performance of the algorithm with respect to previous algorithms. Specifically, we show that Dirac-equation signal processing can also be used efficiently if the true signal is a non-trivial linear combination of more than one eigenstate of the Dirac equation, as it generally occurs for real signals.</description>

      <title>How to Squeeze An Explanation Out of Your Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models are widely used nowadays for their reliability in performing various tasks. However, they do not typically provide the reasoning behind their decision, which is a significant drawback, particularly for more sensitive areas such as biometrics, security and healthcare. The most commonly used approaches to provide interpretability create visual attention heatmaps of regions of interest on an image based on models gradient backpropagation. Although this is a viable approach, current methods are targeted toward image settings and default/standard deep learning models, meaning that they require significant adaptations to work on video/multi-modal settings and custom architectures. This paper proposes an approach for interpretability that is model-agnostic, based on a novel use of the Squeeze and Excitation (SE) block that creates visual attention heatmaps. By including an SE block prior to the classification layer of any model, we are able to retrieve the most influential features via SE vector manipulation, one of the key components of the SE block. Our results show that this new SE-based interpretability can be applied to various models in image and video/multi-modal settings, namely biometrics of facial features with CelebA and behavioral biometrics using Active Speaker Detection datasets. Furthermore, our proposal does not compromise model performance toward the original task, and has competitive results with current interpretability approaches in state-of-the-art object datasets, highlighting its robustness to perform in varying data aside from the biometric context.</description>

      <title>The Polynomial Stein Discrepancy for Assessing Moment Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for measuring the discrepancy between a set of samples and a desired posterior distribution for Bayesian inference. Classical methods for assessing sample quality like the effective sample size are not appropriate for scalable Bayesian sampling algorithms, such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, that are asymptotically biased. Instead, the gold standard is to use the kernel Stein Discrepancy (KSD), which is itself not scalable given its quadratic cost in the number of samples. The KSD and its faster extensions also typically suffer from the curse-of-dimensionality and can require extensive tuning. To address these limitations, we develop the polynomial Stein discrepancy (PSD) and an associated goodness-of-fit test. While the new test is not fully convergence-determining, we prove that it detects differences in the first r moments in the Bernstein-von Mises limit. We empirically show that the test has higher power than its competitors in several examples, and at a lower computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate that the PSD can assist practitioners to select hyper-parameters of Bayesian sampling algorithms more efficiently than competitors.</description>

      <title>Explingo: Explaining AI Predictions using Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explanations of machine learning (ML) model predictions generated by Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as SHAP are essential for people using ML outputs for decision-making. We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform these explanations into human-readable, narrative formats that align with natural communication. We address two key research questions: (1) Can LLMs reliably transform traditional explanations into high-quality narratives? and (2) How can we effectively evaluate the quality of narrative explanations? To answer these questions, we introduce Explingo, which consists of two LLM-based subsystems, a Narrator and Grader. The Narrator takes in ML explanations and transforms them into natural-language descriptions. The Grader scores these narratives on a set of metrics including accuracy, completeness, fluency, and conciseness.
  Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can generate high-quality narratives that achieve high scores across all metrics, particularly when guided by a small number of human-labeled and bootstrapped examples. We also identified areas that remain challenging, in particular for effectively scoring narratives in complex domains. The findings from this work have been integrated into an open-source tool that makes narrative explanations available for further applications.</description>

      <title>LoRA.rar: Learning to Merge LoRAs via Hypernetworks for Subject-Style Conditioned Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image generation models have enabled personalized image creation with both user-defined subjects (content) and styles. Prior works achieved personalization by merging corresponding low-rank adaptation parameters (LoRAs) through optimization-based methods, which are computationally demanding and unsuitable for real-time use on resource-constrained devices like smartphones. To address this, we introduce LoRA.rar, a method that not only improves image quality but also achieves a remarkable speedup of over $4000\times$ in the merging process. LoRA.rar pre-trains a hypernetwork on a diverse set of content-style LoRA pairs, learning an efficient merging strategy that generalizes to new, unseen content-style pairs, enabling fast, high-quality personalization. Moreover, we identify limitations in existing evaluation metrics for content-style quality and propose a new protocol using multimodal large language models (MLLM) for more accurate assessment. Our method significantly outperforms the current state of the art in both content and style fidelity, as validated by MLLM assessments and human evaluations.</description>

      <title>A Differentially Private Kaplan-Meier Estimator for Privacy-Preserving Survival Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a differentially private approach to Kaplan-Meier estimation that achieves accurate survival probability estimates while safeguarding individual privacy. The Kaplan-Meier estimator is widely used in survival analysis to estimate survival functions over time, yet applying it to sensitive datasets, such as clinical records, risks revealing private information. To address this, we introduce a novel algorithm that applies time-indexed Laplace noise, dynamic clipping, and smoothing to produce a privacy-preserving survival curve while maintaining the cumulative structure of the Kaplan-Meier estimator. By scaling noise over time, the algorithm accounts for decreasing sensitivity as fewer individuals remain at risk, while dynamic clipping and smoothing prevent extreme values and reduce fluctuations, preserving the natural shape of the survival curve.
  Our results, evaluated on the NCCTG lung cancer dataset, show that the proposed method effectively lowers root mean squared error (RMSE) and enhances accuracy across privacy budgets ($\epsilon$). At $\epsilon = 10$, the algorithm achieves an RMSE as low as 0.04, closely approximating non-private estimates. Additionally, membership inference attacks reveal that higher $\epsilon$ values (e.g., $\epsilon \geq 6$) significantly reduce influential points, particularly at higher thresholds, lowering susceptibility to inference attacks. These findings confirm that our approach balances privacy and utility, advancing privacy-preserving survival analysis.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used in various tasks, motivating us to develop an LLM-based assistant for videos. Instead of training from scratch, we propose a module to transform arbitrary well-trained image-based LLMs into video-LLMs (after being trained on video data). To better adapt image-LLMs for processing videos, we introduce two design principles: linear transformation to preserve the original visual-language alignment and representative information condensation from redundant video content. Guided by these principles, we propose a plug-and-play Linear Video Tokenizer(LinVT), which enables existing image-LLMs to understand videos. We benchmark LinVT with six recent visual LLMs: Aquila, Blip-3, InternVL2, Mipha, Molmo and Qwen2-VL, showcasing the high compatibility of LinVT. LinVT-based LLMs achieve state-of-the-art performance across various video benchmarks, illustrating the effectiveness of LinVT in multi-modal video understanding.</description>

      <title>Global Optimization with A Power-Transformed Objective and Gaussian Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method that solves global optimization problems in two steps: (1) perform a (exponential) power-$N$ transformation to the not-necessarily differentiable objective function $f$ to obtain $f_N$, and (2) optimize the Gaussian-smoothed $f_N$ with stochastic approximations. Under mild conditions on $f$, for any $\delta&gt;0$, we prove that with a sufficiently large power $N_\delta$, this method converges to a solution in the $\delta$-neighborhood of $f$'s global maximum point. The convergence rate is $O(d^2\sigma^4\varepsilon^{-2})$, which is faster than both the standard and single-loop homotopy methods. Extensive experiments show that our method requires significantly fewer iterations than other compared algorithms to produce a high-quality solution.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed reduced order model with conditional neural fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the conditional neural fields for reduced-order modeling (CNF-ROM) framework to approximate solutions of parametrized partial differential equations (PDEs). The approach combines a parametric neural ODE (PNODE) for modeling latent dynamics over time with a decoder that reconstructs PDE solutions from the corresponding latent states. We introduce a physics-informed learning objective for CNF-ROM, which includes two key components. First, the framework uses coordinate-based neural networks to calculate and minimize PDE residuals by computing spatial derivatives via automatic differentiation and applying the chain rule for time derivatives. Second, exact initial and boundary conditions (IC/BC) are imposed using approximate distance functions (ADFs) [Sukumar and Srivastava, CMAME, 2022]. However, ADFs introduce a trade-off as their second- or higher-order derivatives become unstable at the joining points of boundaries. To address this, we introduce an auxiliary network inspired by [Gladstone et al., NeurIPS ML4PS workshop, 2022]. Our method is validated through parameter extrapolation and interpolation, temporal extrapolation, and comparisons with analytical solutions.</description>

      <title>CompCap: Improving Multimodal Large Language Models with Composite Captions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How well can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) understand composite images? Composite images (CIs) are synthetic visuals created by merging multiple visual elements, such as charts, posters, or screenshots, rather than being captured directly by a camera. While CIs are prevalent in real-world applications, recent MLLM developments have primarily focused on interpreting natural images (NIs). Our research reveals that current MLLMs face significant challenges in accurately understanding CIs, often struggling to extract information or perform complex reasoning based on these images. We find that existing training data for CIs are mostly formatted for question-answer tasks (e.g., in datasets like ChartQA and ScienceQA), while high-quality image-caption datasets, critical for robust vision-language alignment, are only available for NIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce Composite Captions (CompCap), a flexible framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and automation tools to synthesize CIs with accurate and detailed captions. Using CompCap, we curate CompCap-118K, a dataset containing 118K image-caption pairs across six CI types. We validate the effectiveness of CompCap-118K by supervised fine-tuning MLLMs of three sizes: xGen-MM-inst.-4B and LLaVA-NeXT-Vicuna-7B/13B. Empirical results show that CompCap-118K significantly enhances MLLMs' understanding of CIs, yielding average gains of 1.7%, 2.0%, and 2.9% across eleven benchmarks, respectively.</description>

      <title>From classical techniques to convolution-based models: A review of object detection algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision and image understanding, with the goal of identifying and localizing objects of interest within an image while assigning them corresponding class labels. Traditional methods, which relied on handcrafted features and shallow models, struggled with complex visual data and showed limited performance. These methods combined low-level features with contextual information and lacked the ability to capture high-level semantics. Deep learning, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), addressed these limitations by automatically learning rich, hierarchical features directly from data. These features include both semantic and high-level representations essential for accurate object detection. This paper reviews object detection frameworks, starting with classical computer vision methods. We categorize object detection approaches into two groups: (1) classical computer vision techniques and (2) CNN-based detectors. We compare major CNN models, discussing their strengths and limitations. In conclusion, this review highlights the significant advancements in object detection through deep learning and identifies key areas for further research to improve performance.</description>

      <title>Extrapolated Urban View Synthesis Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photorealistic simulators are essential for the training and evaluation of vision-centric autonomous vehicles (AVs). At their core is Novel View Synthesis (NVS), a crucial capability that generates diverse unseen viewpoints to accommodate the broad and continuous pose distribution of AVs. Recent advances in radiance fields, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting, achieve photorealistic rendering at real-time speeds and have been widely used in modeling large-scale driving scenes. However, their performance is commonly evaluated using an interpolated setup with highly correlated training and test views. In contrast, extrapolation, where test views largely deviate from training views, remains underexplored, limiting progress in generalizable simulation technology. To address this gap, we leverage publicly available AV datasets with multiple traversals, multiple vehicles, and multiple cameras to build the first Extrapolated Urban View Synthesis (EUVS) benchmark. Meanwhile, we conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations of state-of-the-art Gaussian Splatting methods across different difficulty levels. Our results show that Gaussian Splatting is prone to overfitting to training views. Besides, incorporating diffusion priors and improving geometry cannot fundamentally improve NVS under large view changes, highlighting the need for more robust approaches and large-scale training. We have released our data to help advance self-driving and urban robotics simulation technology.</description>

      <title>Sparse autoencoders reveal selective remapping of visual concepts during adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adapting foundation models for specific purposes has become a standard approach to build machine learning systems for downstream applications. Yet, it is an open question which mechanisms take place during adaptation. Here we develop a new Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) for the CLIP vision transformer, named PatchSAE, to extract interpretable concepts at granular levels (e.g. shape, color, or semantics of an object) and their patch-wise spatial attributions. We explore how these concepts influence the model output in downstream image classification tasks and investigate how recent state-of-the-art prompt-based adaptation techniques change the association of model inputs to these concepts. While activations of concepts slightly change between adapted and non-adapted models, we find that the majority of gains on common adaptation tasks can be explained with the existing concepts already present in the non-adapted foundation model. This work provides a concrete framework to train and use SAEs for Vision Transformers and provides insights into explaining adaptation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Stag-1: Towards Realistic 4D Driving Simulation with Video Generation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 4D driving simulation is essential for developing realistic autonomous driving simulators. Despite advancements in existing methods for generating driving scenes, significant challenges remain in view transformation and spatial-temporal dynamic modeling. To address these limitations, we propose a Spatial-Temporal simulAtion for drivinG (Stag-1) model to reconstruct real-world scenes and design a controllable generative network to achieve 4D simulation. Stag-1 constructs continuous 4D point cloud scenes using surround-view data from autonomous vehicles. It decouples spatial-temporal relationships and produces coherent keyframe videos. Additionally, Stag-1 leverages video generation models to obtain photo-realistic and controllable 4D driving simulation videos from any perspective. To expand the range of view generation, we train vehicle motion videos based on decomposed camera poses, enhancing modeling capabilities for distant scenes. Furthermore, we reconstruct vehicle camera trajectories to integrate 3D points across consecutive views, enabling comprehensive scene understanding along the temporal dimension. Following extensive multi-level scene training, Stag-1 can simulate from any desired viewpoint and achieve a deep understanding of scene evolution under static spatial-temporal conditions. Compared to existing methods, our approach shows promising performance in multi-view scene consistency, background coherence, and accuracy, and contributes to the ongoing advancements in realistic autonomous driving simulation.

      <title>Evaluation of post-hoc interpretability methods in time-series classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.05656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Post-hoc interpretability methods are critical tools to explain neural-network results. Several post-hoc methods have emerged in recent years, but when applied to a given task, they produce different results, raising the question of which method is the most suitable to provide correct post-hoc interpretability. To understand the performance of each method, quantitative evaluation of interpretability methods is essential. However, currently available frameworks have several drawbacks which hinders the adoption of post-hoc interpretability methods, especially in high-risk sectors. In this work, we propose a framework with quantitative metrics to assess the performance of existing post-hoc interpretability methods in particular in time series classification. We show that several drawbacks identified in the literature are addressed, namely dependence on human judgement, retraining, and shift in the data distribution when occluding samples. We additionally design a synthetic dataset with known discriminative features and tunable complexity. The proposed methodology and quantitative metrics can be used to understand the reliability of interpretability methods results obtained in practical applications. In turn, they can be embedded within operational workflows in critical fields that require accurate interpretability results for e.g., regulatory policies.</description>

      <title>Defending Object Detectors against Patch Attacks with Out-of-Distribution Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Patch attacks against object detectors have been of recent interest due to their being physically realizable and more closely aligned with practical systems. In response to this threat, many new defenses have been proposed that train a patch segmenter model to detect and remove the patch before the image is passed to the downstream model. We unify these approaches with a flexible framework, OODSmoother, which characterizes the properties of approaches that aim to remove adversarial patches. This framework naturally guides us to design 1) a novel adaptive attack that breaks existing patch attack defenses on object detectors, and 2) a novel defense approach SemPrior that takes advantage of semantic priors. Our key insight behind SemPrior is that the existing machine learning-based patch detectors struggle to learn semantic priors and that explicitly incorporating them can improve performance. We find that SemPrior alone provides up to a 40% gain, or up to a 60% gain when combined with existing defenses.</description>

      <title>Does Deep Active Learning Work in the Wild?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep active learning (DAL) methods have shown significant improvements in sample efficiency compared to simple random sampling. While these studies are valuable, they nearly always assume that optimal DAL hyperparameter (HP) settings are known in advance, or optimize the HPs through repeating DAL several times with different HP settings. Here, we argue that in real-world settings, or in the wild, there is significant uncertainty regarding good HPs, and their optimization contradicts the premise of using DAL (i.e., we require labeling efficiency). In this study, we evaluate the performance of eleven modern DAL methods on eight benchmark problems as we vary a key HP shared by all methods: the pool ratio. Despite adjusting only one HP, our results indicate that eight of the eleven DAL methods sometimes underperform relative to simple random sampling and some frequently perform worse. Only three methods always outperform random sampling (albeit narrowly), and we find that these methods all utilize diversity to select samples - a relatively simple criterion. Our findings reveal the limitations of existing DAL methods when deployed in the wild, and present this as an important new open problem in the field.</description>

      <title>The Score-Difference Flow for Implicit Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12906v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implicit generative modeling (IGM) aims to produce samples of synthetic data matching the characteristics of a target data distribution. Recent work (e.g. score-matching networks, diffusion models) has approached the IGM problem from the perspective of pushing synthetic source data toward the target distribution via dynamical perturbations or flows in the ambient space. In this direction, we present the score difference (SD) between arbitrary target and source distributions as a flow that optimally reduces the Kullback-Leibler divergence between them. We apply the SD flow to convenient proxy distributions, which are aligned if and only if the original distributions are aligned. We demonstrate the formal equivalence of this formulation to denoising diffusion models under certain conditions. We also show that the training of generative adversarial networks includes a hidden data-optimization sub-problem, which induces the SD flow under certain choices of loss function when the discriminator is optimal. As a result, the SD flow provides a theoretical link between model classes that individually address the three challenges of the "generative modeling trilemma" -- high sample quality, mode coverage, and fast sampling -- thereby setting the stage for a unified approach.</description>

      <title>A Simple Data Augmentation for Feature Distribution Skewed Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates collaborative learning among multiple clients in a distributed manner and ensures the security of privacy. However, its performance inevitably degrades with non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data. In this paper, we focus on the feature distribution skewed FL scenario, a common non-IID situation in real-world applications where data from different clients exhibit varying underlying distributions. This variation leads to feature shift, which is a key issue of this scenario. While previous works have made notable progress, few pay attention to the data itself, i.e., the root of this issue. The primary goal of this paper is to mitigate feature shift from the perspective of data. To this end, we propose a simple yet remarkably effective input-level data augmentation method, namely FedRDN, which randomly injects the statistical information of the local distribution from the entire federation into the client's data. This is beneficial to improve the generalization of local feature representations, thereby mitigating feature shift. Moreover, our FedRDN is a plug-and-play component, which can be seamlessly integrated into the data augmentation flow with only a few lines of code. Extensive experiments on several datasets show that the performance of various representative FL methods can be further improved by integrating our FedRDN, demonstrating its effectiveness, strong compatibility and generalizability.

      <title>QuickDrop: Efficient Federated Unlearning by Integrated Dataset Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Unlearning (FU) aims to delete specific training data from an ML model trained using Federated Learning (FL). We introduce QuickDrop, an efficient and original FU method that utilizes dataset distillation (DD) to accelerate unlearning and drastically reduces computational overhead compared to existing approaches. In QuickDrop, each client uses DD to generate a compact dataset representative of the original training dataset, called a distilled dataset, and uses this compact dataset during unlearning. To unlearn specific knowledge from the global model, QuickDrop has clients execute Stochastic Gradient Ascent with samples from the distilled datasets, thus significantly reducing computational overhead compared to conventional FU methods. We further increase the efficiency of QuickDrop by ingeniously integrating DD into the FL training process. By reusing the gradient updates produced during FL training for DD, the overhead of creating distilled datasets becomes close to negligible. Evaluations on three standard datasets show that, with comparable accuracy guarantees, QuickDrop reduces the duration of unlearning by 463.8x compared to model retraining from scratch and 65.1x compared to existing FU approaches. We also demonstrate the scalability of QuickDrop with 100 clients and show its effectiveness while handling multiple unlearning operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01201v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data privacy protection is garnering increased attention among researchers. Diffusion models (DMs), particularly with strict differential privacy, can potentially produce images with both high privacy and visual quality. However, challenges arise such as in ensuring robust protection in privatizing specific data attributes, areas where current models often fall short. To address these challenges, we introduce the PAC Privacy Preserving Diffusion Model, a model leverages diffusion principles and ensure Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) privacy. We enhance privacy protection by integrating a private classifier guidance into the Langevin Sampling Process. Additionally, recognizing the gap in measuring the privacy of models, we have developed a novel metric to gauge privacy levels. Our model, assessed with this new metric and supported by Gaussian matrix computations for the PAC bound, has shown superior performance in privacy protection over existing leading private generative models according to benchmark tests.</description>

      <title>Fast Sampling via Discrete Non-Markov Diffusion Models with Predetermined Transition Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for high-quality data generation. Despite their success in discrete spaces, such as text generation tasks, the acceleration of discrete diffusion models remains under-explored. In this paper, we propose discrete non-Markov diffusion models (DNDM), which naturally induce the predetermined transition time set. This enables a training-free sampling algorithm that significantly reduces the number of function evaluations (i.e., calls to the neural network), making the sampling process much faster. Furthermore, we study the transition from finite to infinite step sampling, offering new insights into bridging the gap between discrete and continuous-time processes for discrete diffusion models. Extensive experiments on natural language generation and machine translation tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our method in terms of both generation speed and sample quality compared to existing methods for discrete diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Topological Dependencies in Spatio-Temporal Graphs with Cycle Message Passing Blocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformer-based models have been increasingly adopted to learn the complex vector representations of spatio-temporal graphs, capturing intricate spatio-temporal dependencies crucial for applications such as traffic datasets. Although many existing methods utilize multi-head attention mechanisms and message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture both spatial and temporal relations, these approaches encode temporal and spatial relations independently, and reflect the graph's topological characteristics in a limited manner. In this work, we introduce the Cycle to Mixer (Cy2Mixer), a novel spatio-temporal GNN based on topological non-trivial invariants of spatio-temporal graphs with gated multi-layer perceptrons (gMLP). The Cy2Mixer is composed of three blocks based on MLPs: A temporal block for capturing temporal properties, a message-passing block for encapsulating spatial information, and a cycle message-passing block for enriching topological information through cyclic subgraphs. We bolster the effectiveness of Cy2Mixer with mathematical evidence emphasizing that our cycle message-passing block is capable of offering differentiated information to the deep learning model compared to the message-passing block. Furthermore, empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy of the Cy2Mixer, demonstrating state-of-the-art performances across various spatio-temporal benchmark datasets.

      <title>SimMLP: Training MLPs on Graphs without Supervision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in various graph learning tasks, yet their reliance on neighborhood aggregation during inference poses challenges for deployment in latency-sensitive applications, such as real-time financial fraud detection. To address this limitation, recent studies have proposed distilling knowledge from teacher GNNs into student Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained on node content, aiming to accelerate inference. However, these approaches often inadequately explore structural information when inferring unseen nodes. To this end, we introduce SimMLP, a Self-supervised framework for learning MLPs on graphs, designed to fully integrate rich structural information into MLPs. Notably, SimMLP is the first MLP-learning method that can achieve equivalence to GNNs in the optimal case. The key idea is to employ self-supervised learning to align the representations encoded by graph context-aware GNNs and neighborhood dependency-free MLPs, thereby fully integrating the structural information into MLPs. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating the equivalence between SimMLP and GNNs based on mutual information and inductive bias, highlighting SimMLP's advanced structural learning capabilities. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets, covering node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, to showcase SimMLP's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios involving unseen nodes (e.g., inductive and cold-start node classification) where structural insights are crucial. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/SimMLP.</description>

      <title>An end-to-end attention-based approach for learning on graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been a recent surge in transformer-based architectures for learning on graphs, mainly motivated by attention as an effective learning mechanism and the desire to supersede handcrafted operators characteristic of message passing schemes. However, concerns over their empirical effectiveness, scalability, and complexity of the pre-processing steps have been raised, especially in relation to much simpler graph neural networks that typically perform on par with them across a wide range of benchmarks. To tackle these shortcomings, we consider graphs as sets of edges and propose a purely attention-based approach consisting of an encoder and an attention pooling mechanism. The encoder vertically interleaves masked and vanilla self-attention modules to learn an effective representations of edges, while allowing for tackling possible misspecifications in input graphs. Despite its simplicity, the approach outperforms fine-tuned message passing baselines and recently proposed transformer-based methods on more than 70 node and graph-level tasks, including challenging long-range benchmarks. Moreover, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across different tasks, ranging from molecular to vision graphs, and heterophilous node classification. The approach also outperforms graph neural networks and transformers in transfer learning settings, and scales much better than alternatives with a similar performance level or expressive power.</description>

      <title>Remaining-data-free Machine Unlearning by Suppressing Sample Contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is to forget data from a well-trained model, which is practically important due to the ``right to be forgotten''. The unlearned model should approach the retrained model, where the forgetting data are not involved in the training process and hence do not contribute to the retrained model. Considering the forgetting data's absence during retraining, we think unlearning should withdraw their contribution from the pre-trained model. The challenge is that when tracing the learning process is impractical, how to quantify and detach sample's contribution to the dynamic learning process using only the pre-trained model. We first theoretically discover that sample's contribution during the process will reflect in the learned model's sensitivity to it. We then practically design a novel method, namely MU-Mis (Machine Unlearning by Minimizing input sensitivity), to suppress the contribution of the forgetting data. Experimental results demonstrate that MU-Mis can unlearn effectively and efficiently without utilizing the remaining data. It is the first time that a remaining-data-free method can outperform state-of-the-art (SoTA) unlearning methods that utilize the remaining data.</description>

      <title>Automated Federated Pipeline for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge in the development of advanced intelligent generative content (AIGC), especially large language models (LLMs). However, for many downstream tasks, it is necessary to fine-tune LLMs using private data. While federated learning offers a promising privacy-preserving solution to LLM fine-tuning, the substantial size of an LLM, combined with high computational and communication demands, makes it hard to apply to downstream tasks. More importantly, private edge servers often possess varying computing and network resources in real-world scenarios, introducing additional complexities to LLM fine-tuning. To tackle these problems, we design and implement an automated federated pipeline, named FedPipe, to fine-tune LLMs with minimal training cost but without adding any inference latency. FedPipe firstly identifies the weights to be fine-tuned based on their contributions to the LLM training. It then configures a low-rank adapter for each selected weight to train local low-rank adapters on an edge server, and aggregate local adapters of all edge servers to fine-tune the whole LLM. Finally, it appropriately quantizes the parameters of LLM to reduce memory space according to the requirements of edge servers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedPipe expedites the model training and achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art benchmarks.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Loop and Clique Coarsening Algorithm for Graph Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11869v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have made remarkable achievements in graph-level tasks. However, most existing works regard graph structures as a form of guidance or bias for enhancing node representations, which focuses on node-central perspectives and lacks explicit representations of edges and structures. One natural question arises as to whether we can leverage a hypernode to represent some structures. Through experimental analysis, we explore the feasibility of this assumption. Based on our findings, we propose an efficient Loop and Clique Coarsening algorithm with linear complexity for Graph Classification (LCC4GC) on GT architecture. Specifically, we build three unique views, original, coarsening, and conversion, to learn a thorough structural representation. We compress loops and cliques via hierarchical heuristic graph coarsening and restrict them with well-designed constraints, which builds the coarsening view to learn high-level interactions between structures. We also introduce line graphs for edge embeddings and switch to edge-central perspective to alleviate the impact of coarsening reduction. Experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the improvements of LCC4GC over 31 baselines from various architectures.</description>

      <title>Matching the Statistical Query Lower Bound for $k$-Sparse Parity Problems with Sign Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $k$-sparse parity problem is a classical problem in computational complexity and algorithmic theory, serving as a key benchmark for understanding computational classes. In this paper, we solve the $k$-sparse parity problem with sign stochastic gradient descent, a variant of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on two-layer fully-connected neural networks. We demonstrate that this approach can efficiently solve the $k$-sparse parity problem on a $d$-dimensional hypercube ($k\leq O(\sqrt{d})$) with a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(d^{k-1})$ using $2^{\Theta(k)}$ neurons, matching the established $\Omega(d^{k})$ lower bounds of Statistical Query (SQ) models. Our theoretical analysis begins by constructing a good neural network capable of correctly solving the $k$-parity problem. We then demonstrate how a trained neural network with sign SGD can effectively approximate this good network, solving the $k$-parity problem with small statistical errors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that matches the SQ lower bound for solving $k$-sparse parity problem using gradient-based methods.</description>

      <title>URVFL: Undetectable Data Reconstruction Attack on Vertical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Launching effective malicious attacks in VFL presents unique challenges: 1) Firstly, given the distributed nature of clients' data features and models, each client rigorously guards its privacy and prohibits direct querying, complicating any attempts to steal data; 2) Existing malicious attacks alter the underlying VFL training task, and are hence easily detected by comparing the received gradients with the ones received in honest training. To overcome these challenges, we develop URVFL, a novel attack strategy that evades current detection mechanisms. The key idea is to integrate a discriminator with auxiliary classifier that takes a full advantage of the label information and generates malicious gradients to the victim clients: on one hand, label information helps to better characterize embeddings of samples from distinct classes, yielding an improved reconstruction performance; on the other hand, computing malicious gradients with label information better mimics the honest training, making the malicious gradients indistinguishable from the honest ones, and the attack much more stealthy. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that URVFL significantly outperforms existing attacks, and successfully circumvents SOTA detection methods for malicious attacks. Additional ablation studies and evaluations on defenses further underscore the robustness and effectiveness of URVFL. Our code will be available at https://github.com/duanyiyao/URVFL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the 1990s, the constant error carousel and gating were introduced as the central ideas of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.</description>

Abstract: In multi-task learning, the conventional approach involves training a model on multiple tasks simultaneously. However, the training signals from different tasks can interfere with one another, potentially leading to \textit{negative transfer}. To mitigate this, we investigate if modular language models can facilitate positive transfer and systematic generalization. Specifically, we propose a novel modular language model (\texttt{TensorPoly}), that balances parameter efficiency with nuanced routing methods. For \textit{modules}, we reparameterize Low-Rank Adaptation (\texttt{LoRA}) by employing an entangled tensor through the use of tensor product operations and name the resulting approach \texttt{TLoRA}. For \textit{routing function}, we tailor two innovative routing functions according to the granularity: \texttt{TensorPoly-I} which directs to each rank within the entangled tensor while \texttt{TensorPoly-II} offers a finer-grained routing approach targeting each order of the entangled tensor. The experimental results from the multi-task T0-benchmark demonstrate that: 1) all modular LMs surpass the corresponding dense approaches, highlighting the potential of modular language models to mitigate negative inference in multi-task learning and deliver superior outcomes. 2) \texttt{TensorPoly-I} achieves higher parameter efficiency in adaptation and outperforms other modular LMs, which shows the potential of our approach in multi-task transfer learning.</description>

      <title>EM Distillation for One-step Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While diffusion models can learn complex distributions, sampling requires a computationally expensive iterative process. Existing distillation methods enable efficient sampling, but have notable limitations, such as performance degradation with very few sampling steps, reliance on training data access, or mode-seeking optimization that may fail to capture the full distribution. We propose EM Distillation (EMD), a maximum likelihood-based approach that distills a diffusion model to a one-step generator model with minimal loss of perceptual quality. Our approach is derived through the lens of Expectation-Maximization (EM), where the generator parameters are updated using samples from the joint distribution of the diffusion teacher prior and inferred generator latents. We develop a reparametrized sampling scheme and a noise cancellation technique that together stabilizes the distillation process. We further reveal an interesting connection of our method with existing methods that minimize mode-seeking KL. EMD outperforms existing one-step generative methods in terms of FID scores on ImageNet-64 and ImageNet-128, and compares favorably with prior work on distilling text-to-image diffusion models.</description>

      <title>The Intelligible and Effective Graph Neural Additive Networks</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the predominant approach for learning over graph-structured data. However, most GNNs operate as black-box models and require post-hoc explanations, which may not suffice in high-stakes scenarios where transparency is crucial. In this paper, we present a GNN that is interpretable by design. Our model, Graph Neural Additive Network (GNAN), is a novel extension of the interpretable class of Generalized Additive Models, and can be visualized and fully understood by humans. GNAN is designed to be fully interpretable, offering both global and local explanations at the feature and graph levels through direct visualization of the model. These visualizations describe exactly how the model uses the relationships between the target variable, the features, and the graph. We demonstrate the intelligibility of GNANs in a series of examples on different tasks and datasets. In addition, we show that the accuracy of GNAN is on par with black-box GNNs, making it suitable for critical applications where transparency is essential, alongside high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction for Class-wise Coverage via Augmented Label Rank Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06818v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is an emerging uncertainty quantification framework that allows us to construct a prediction set to cover the true label with a pre-specified marginal or conditional probability. Although the valid coverage guarantee has been extensively studied for classification problems, CP often produces large prediction sets which may not be practically useful. This issue is exacerbated for the setting of class-conditional coverage on imbalanced classification tasks with many and/or imbalanced classes. This paper proposes the Rank Calibrated Class-conditional CP (RC3P) algorithm to reduce the prediction set sizes to achieve class-conditional coverage, where the valid coverage holds for each class. In contrast to the standard class-conditional CP (CCP) method that uniformly thresholds the class-wise conformity score for each class, the augmented label rank calibration step allows RC3P to selectively iterate this class-wise thresholding subroutine only for a subset of classes whose class-wise top-k error is small. We prove that agnostic to the classifier and data distribution, RC3P achieves class-wise coverage. We also show that RC3P reduces the size of prediction sets compared to the CCP method. Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that RC3P achieves class-wise coverage and 26.25% reduction in prediction set sizes on average.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Must Be Taught to Know What They Don't Know</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When using large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes applications, we need to know when we can trust their predictions. Some works argue that prompting high-performance LLMs is sufficient to produce calibrated uncertainties, while others introduce sampling methods that can be prohibitively expensive. In this work, we first argue that prompting on its own is insufficient to achieve good calibration and then show that fine-tuning on a small dataset of correct and incorrect answers can create an uncertainty estimate with good generalization and small computational overhead. We show that a thousand graded examples are sufficient to outperform baseline methods and that training through the features of a model is necessary for good performance and tractable for large open-source models when using LoRA. We also investigate the mechanisms that enable reliable LLM uncertainty estimation, finding that many models can be used as general-purpose uncertainty estimators, applicable not just to their own uncertainties but also the uncertainty of other models. Lastly, we show that uncertainty estimates inform human use of LLMs in human-AI collaborative settings through a user study.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Higher-Order Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order graph neural networks (HOGNNs) and the related architectures from Topological Deep Learning are an important class of GNN models that harness polyadic relations between vertices beyond plain edges. They have been used to eliminate issues such as over-smoothing or over-squashing, to significantly enhance the accuracy of GNN predictions, to improve the expressiveness of GNN architectures, and for numerous other goals. A plethora of HOGNN models have been introduced, and they come with diverse neural architectures, and even with different notions of what the "higher-order" means. This richness makes it very challenging to appropriately analyze and compare HOGNN models, and to decide in what scenario to use specific ones. To alleviate this, we first design an in-depth taxonomy and a blueprint for HOGNNs. This facilitates designing models that maximize performance. Then, we use our taxonomy to analyze and compare the available HOGNN models. The outcomes of our analysis are synthesized in a set of insights that help to select the most beneficial GNN model in a given scenario, and a comprehensive list of challenges and opportunities for further research into more powerful HOGNNs.</description>

      <title>Under the Hood of Tabular Data Generation Models: Benchmarks with Extensive Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to train generative models that produce realistic, safe and useful tabular data is essential for data privacy, imputation, oversampling, explainability or simulation. However, generating tabular data is not straightforward due to its heterogeneity, non-smooth distributions, complex dependencies and imbalanced categorical features. Although diverse methods have been proposed in the literature, there is a need for a unified evaluation, under the same conditions, on a variety of datasets. This study addresses this need by fully considering the optimization of: hyperparameters, feature encodings, and architectures. We investigate the impact of dataset-specific tuning on five recent model families for tabular data generation through an extensive benchmark on 16 datasets. These datasets vary in terms of size (an average of 80,000 rows), data types, and domains. We also propose a reduced search space for each model that allows for quick optimization, achieving nearly equivalent performance at a significantly lower cost. Our benchmark demonstrates that, for most models, large-scale dataset-specific tuning substantially improves performance compared to the original configurations. Furthermore, we confirm that diffusion-based models generally outperform other models on tabular data. However, this advantage is not significant when the entire tuning and training process is restricted to the same GPU budget.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Numerical Reasoning in Text-to-Image Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image generative models are capable of producing high-quality images that often faithfully depict concepts described using natural language. In this work, we comprehensively evaluate a range of text-to-image models on numerical reasoning tasks of varying difficulty, and show that even the most advanced models have only rudimentary numerical skills. Specifically, their ability to correctly generate an exact number of objects in an image is limited to small numbers, it is highly dependent on the context the number term appears in, and it deteriorates quickly with each successive number. We also demonstrate that models have poor understanding of linguistic quantifiers (such as "a few" or "as many as"), the concept of zero, and struggle with more advanced concepts such as partial quantities and fractional representations. We bundle prompts, generated images and human annotations into GeckoNum, a novel benchmark for evaluation of numerical reasoning.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Vision-and-Language Models on Children's Mathematical Olympiads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a significant progress in the general-purpose problem solving abilities of large vision and language models (LVLMs), such as ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.; some of these breakthroughs even seem to enable AI models to outperform human abilities in varied tasks that demand higher-order cognitive skills. Are the current large AI models indeed capable of generalized problem solving as humans do? A systematic analysis of AI capabilities for joint vision and text reasoning, however, is missing in the current scientific literature. In this paper, we make an effort towards filling this gap, by evaluating state-of-the-art LVLMs on their mathematical and algorithmic reasoning abilities using visuo-linguistic problems from children's Olympiads. Specifically, we consider problems from the Mathematical Kangaroo (MK) Olympiad, which is a popular international competition targeted at children from grades 1-12, that tests children's deeper mathematical abilities using puzzles that are appropriately gauged to their age and skills. Using the puzzles from MK, we created a dataset, dubbed SMART-840, consisting of 840 problems from years 2020-2024. With our dataset, we analyze LVLMs power on mathematical reasoning; their responses on our puzzles offer a direct way to compare against that of children. Our results show that modern LVLMs do demonstrate increasingly powerful reasoning skills in solving problems for higher grades, but lack the foundations to correctly answer problems designed for younger children. Further analysis shows that there is no significant correlation between the reasoning capabilities of AI models and that of young children, and their capabilities appear to be based on a different type of reasoning than the cumulative knowledge that underlies children's mathematics and logic skills.</description>

      <title>Fast Tree-Field Integrators: From Low Displacement Rank to Topological Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new class of fast polylog-linear algorithms based on the theory of structured matrices (in particular low displacement rank) for integrating tensor fields defined on weighted trees. Several applications of the resulting fast tree-field integrators (FTFIs) are presented, including (a) approximation of graph metrics with tree metrics, (b) graph classification, (c) modeling on meshes, and finally (d) Topological Transformers (TTs) (Choromanski et al., 2022) for images. For Topological Transformers, we propose new relative position encoding (RPE) masking mechanisms with as few as three extra learnable parameters per Transformer layer, leading to 1.0-1.5%+ accuracy gains. Importantly, most of FTFIs are exact methods, thus numerically equivalent to their brute-force counterparts. When applied to graphs with thousands of nodes, those exact algorithms provide 5.7-13x speedups. We also provide an extensive theoretical analysis of our methods.</description>

      <title>Generative Modelling of Structurally Constrained Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art techniques in graph generation; yet, integrating domain knowledge into these models remains challenging. Domain knowledge is particularly important in real-world scenarios, where invalid generated graphs hinder deployment in practical applications. Unconstrained and conditioned graph diffusion models fail to guarantee such domain-specific structural properties. We present ConStruct, a novel framework that enables graph diffusion models to incorporate hard constraints on specific properties, such as planarity or acyclicity. Our approach ensures that the sampled graphs remain within the domain of graphs that satisfy the specified property throughout the entire trajectory in both the forward and reverse processes. This is achieved by introducing an edge-absorbing noise model and a new projector operator. ConStruct demonstrates versatility across several structural and edge-deletion invariant constraints and achieves state-of-the-art performance for both synthetic benchmarks and attributed real-world datasets. For example, by incorporating planarity constraints in digital pathology graph datasets, the proposed method outperforms existing baselines, improving data validity by up to 71.1 percentage points.</description>

      <title>Separable Operator Networks</title>

Abstract: Operator learning has become a powerful tool in machine learning for modeling complex physical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Although Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet) show promise, they require extensive data acquisition. Physics-informed DeepONets (PI-DeepONet) mitigate data scarcity but suffer from inefficient training processes. We introduce Separable Operator Networks (SepONet), a novel framework that significantly enhances the efficiency of physics-informed operator learning. SepONet uses independent trunk networks to learn basis functions separately for different coordinate axes, enabling faster and more memory-efficient training via forward-mode automatic differentiation. We provide a universal approximation theorem for SepONet proving the existence of a separable approximation to any nonlinear continuous operator. Then, we comprehensively benchmark its representational capacity and computational performance against PI-DeepONet. Our results demonstrate SepONet's superior performance across various nonlinear and inseparable PDEs, with SepONet's advantages increasing with problem complexity, dimension, and scale. For 1D time-dependent PDEs, SepONet achieves up to 112x faster training and 82x reduction in GPU memory usage compared to PI-DeepONet, while maintaining comparable accuracy. For the 2D time-dependent nonlinear diffusion equation, SepONet efficiently handles the complexity, achieving a 6.44% mean relative $\ell_{2}$ test error, while PI-DeepONet fails due to memory constraints. This work paves the way for extreme-scale learning of continuous mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces.

      <title>On the Generalization of Preference Learning with DPO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but often struggle to align with human preferences, leading to harmful or undesirable outputs. Preference learning, which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for ensuring that LLMs align with human values. Despite the widespread adoption in real-world systems, a thorough theoretical understanding of the generalization guarantees for these models remain lacking. This paper bridges that gap by introducing a new theoretical framework to analyze the generalization guarantees of models trained with direct preference optimization (DPO). While existing generalization theory often focuses on overparameterized models achieving near-optimal loss or models independent of the training process, our framework rigorously assesses how well models generalize after a finite number of gradient steps, reflecting real-world LLM training practices. By analyzing the reward margin associated with each sample and its trajectory throughout training, we can effectively bound the generalization error. We derive learning guarantees showing that, under specific conditions, models trained with DPO can correctly discern preferred responses on unseen data with high probability. These insights are empirically validated on contemporary LLMs, underscoring the practical relevance of our theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is a necessary component when implementing AI in high-risk settings, such as autonomous cars, medicine, or insurances. Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen a surge in popularity in recent years, but they are subject to hallucinations, which may cause serious harm in high-risk settings. Despite their success, LLMs are expensive to train and run: they need a large amount of computations and memory, preventing the use of ensembling methods in practice. In this work, we present a novel method that allows for fast and memory-friendly training of LLM ensembles. We show that the resulting ensembles can detect hallucinations and are a viable approach in practice as only one GPU is needed for training and inference.</description>

      <title>Consistent Spectral Clustering in Hyperbolic Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clustering, as an unsupervised technique, plays a pivotal role in various data analysis applications. Among clustering algorithms, Spectral Clustering on Euclidean Spaces has been extensively studied. However, with the rapid evolution of data complexity, Euclidean Space is proving to be inefficient for representing and learning algorithms. Although Deep Neural Networks on hyperbolic spaces have gained recent traction, clustering algorithms or non-deep machine learning models on non-Euclidean Spaces remain underexplored. In this paper, we propose a spectral clustering algorithm on Hyperbolic Spaces to address this gap. Hyperbolic Spaces offer advantages in representing complex data structures like hierarchical and tree-like structures, which cannot be embedded efficiently in Euclidean Spaces. Our proposed algorithm replaces the Euclidean Similarity Matrix with an appropriate Hyperbolic Similarity Matrix, demonstrating improved efficiency compared to clustering in Euclidean Spaces. Our contributions include the development of the spectral clustering algorithm on Hyperbolic Spaces and the proof of its weak consistency. We show that our algorithm converges at least as fast as Spectral Clustering on Euclidean Spaces. To illustrate the efficacy of our approach, we present experimental results on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, highlighting the superior performance of Hyperbolic Spectral Clustering over its Euclidean counterpart. This work opens up avenues for utilizing non-Euclidean Spaces in clustering algorithms, offering new perspectives for handling complex data structures and improving clustering efficiency.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, Solving partial differential equations has shifted the focus of traditional neural network studies from finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces to generalized functional spaces in research. A novel methodology is to learn an operator as a means of approximating the mapping between outputs. Currently, researchers have proposed a variety of operator architectures. Nevertheless, the majority of these architectures adopt an iterative update architecture, whereby a single operator is learned from the same function space. In practical physical science problems, the numerical solutions of partial differential equations are complex, and a serial single operator is unable to accurately approximate the intricate mapping between input and output. So, We propose a deep parallel operator model (DPNO) for efficiently and accurately solving partial differential equations. DPNO employs convolutional neural networks to extract local features and map data into distinct latent spaces. Designing a parallel block of double Fourier neural operators to solve the iterative error problem. DPNO approximates complex mappings between inputs and outputs by learning multiple operators in different potential spaces in parallel blocks. DPNO achieved the best performance on five of them, with an average improvement of 10.5\%, and ranked second on one dataset.</description>

      <title>Old Optimizer, New Norm: An Anthology</title>

Abstract: Deep learning optimizers are often motivated through a mix of convex and approximate second-order theory. We select three such methods -- Adam, Shampoo and Prodigy -- and argue that each method can instead be understood as a squarely first-order method without convexity assumptions. In fact, after switching off exponential moving averages, each method is equivalent to steepest descent under a particular norm. By generalizing this observation, we chart a new design space for training algorithms. Different operator norms should be assigned to different tensors based on the role that the tensor plays within the network. For example, while linear and embedding layers may have the same weight space of $\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$, these layers play different roles and should be assigned different norms. We hope that this idea of carefully metrizing the neural architecture might lead to more stable, scalable and indeed faster training.</description>

      <title>Sharper Guarantees for Learning Neural Network Classifiers with Gradient Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the data-dependent convergence and generalization behavior of gradient methods for neural networks with smooth activation. Our first result is a novel bound on the excess risk of deep networks trained by the logistic loss, via an alogirthmic stability analysis. Compared to previous works, our results improve upon the shortcomings of the well-established Rademacher complexity-based bounds. Importantly, the bounds we derive in this paper are tighter, hold even for neural networks of small width, do not scale unfavorably with width, are algorithm-dependent, and consequently capture the role of initialization on the sample complexity of gradient descent for deep nets. Specialized to noiseless data separable with margin $\gamma$ by neural tangent kernel (NTK) features of a network of width $\Omega(\text{poly}(\log(n)))$, we show the test-error rate to be $e^{O(L)}/{\gamma^2 n}$, where $n$ is the training set size and $L$ denotes the number of hidden layers. This is an improvement in the test loss bound compared to previous works while maintaining the poly-logarithmic width conditions. We further investigate excess risk bounds for deep nets trained with noisy data, establishing that under a polynomial condition on the network width, gradient descent can achieve the optimal excess risk. Finally, we show that a large step-size significantly improves upon the NTK regime's results in classifying the XOR distribution. In particular, we show for a one-hidden-layer neural network of constant width $m$ with quadratic activation and standard Gaussian initialization that mini-batch SGD with linear sample complexity and with a large step-size $\eta=m$ reaches the perfect test accuracy after only $\ceil{\log(d)}$ iterations, where $d$ is the data dimension.</description>

      <title>Graph Classification Gaussian Processes via Hodgelet Spectral Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10546v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of classifying graphs is ubiquitous in machine learning. While it is standard to apply graph neural networks or graph kernel methods, Gaussian processes can be employed by transforming spatial features from the graph domain into spectral features in the Euclidean domain, and using them as the input points of classical kernels. However, this approach currently only takes into account features on vertices, whereas some graph datasets also support features on edges. In this work, we present a Gaussian process-based classification algorithm that can leverage one or both vertex and edges features. Furthermore, we take advantage of the Hodge decomposition to better capture the intricate richness of vertex and edge features, which can be beneficial on diverse tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11112v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Differentiable Weightless Neural Network (DWN), a model based on interconnected lookup tables. Training of DWNs is enabled by a novel Extended Finite Difference technique for approximate differentiation of binary values. We propose Learnable Mapping, Learnable Reduction, and Spectral Regularization to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of these models. We evaluate DWNs in three edge computing contexts: (1) an FPGA-based hardware accelerator, where they demonstrate superior latency, throughput, energy efficiency, and model area compared to state-of-the-art solutions, (2) a low-power microcontroller, where they achieve preferable accuracy to XGBoost while subject to stringent memory constraints, and (3) ultra-low-cost chips, where they consistently outperform small models in both accuracy and projected hardware area. DWNs also compare favorably against leading approaches for tabular datasets, with higher average rank. Overall, our work positions DWNs as a pioneering solution for edge-compatible high-throughput neural networks.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Post Training Quantized Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalization abilities of well-trained large language models (LLMs) are known to scale predictably as a function of model size. In contrast to the existence of practical scaling laws governing pre-training, the quality of LLMs after post-training compression remains highly unpredictable, often requiring case-by-case validation in practice. In this work, we attempted to close this gap for post-training weight quantization of LLMs by conducting a systematic empirical study on multiple LLM families quantized to numerous low-precision tensor data types using popular weight quantization techniques. We identified key scaling factors pertaining to characteristics of the local loss landscape, based on which the performance of quantized LLMs can be reasonably well predicted by a statistical model.</description>

      <title>An Evolved Universal Transformer Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prior methods propose to offset the escalating costs of modern foundation models by dropping specific parts of their contexts with hand-designed rules, while attempting to preserve their original performance. We overcome this trade-off with Neural Attention Memory Models (NAMMs), introducing a learned network for memory management that improves both the performance and efficiency of transformers. We evolve NAMMs atop pre-trained transformers to provide different latent contexts focusing on the most relevant information for individual layers and attention heads. NAMMs are universally applicable to any model using self-attention as they condition exclusively on the values in the produced attention matrices. Learning NAMMs on a small set of problems, we achieve substantial performance improvements across multiple long-context benchmarks while cutting the model's input contexts up to a fraction of the original sizes. We show the generality of our conditioning enables zero-shot transfer of NAMMs trained only on language to entirely new transformer architectures even across input modalities, with their benefits carrying over to vision and reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Streaming Deep Reinforcement Learning Finally Works</title>

Abstract: Natural intelligence processes experience as a continuous stream, sensing, acting, and learning moment-by-moment in real time. Streaming learning, the modus operandi of classic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like Q-learning and TD, mimics natural learning by using the most recent sample without storing it. This approach is also ideal for resource-constrained, communication-limited, and privacy-sensitive applications. However, in deep RL, learners almost always use batch updates and replay buffers, making them computationally expensive and incompatible with streaming learning. Although the prevalence of batch deep RL is often attributed to its sample efficiency, a more critical reason for the absence of streaming deep RL is its frequent instability and failure to learn, which we refer to as stream barrier. This paper introduces the stream-x algorithms, the first class of deep RL algorithms to overcome stream barrier for both prediction and control and match sample efficiency of batch RL. Through experiments in Mujoco Gym, DM Control Suite, and Atari Games, we demonstrate stream barrier in existing algorithms and successful stable learning with our stream-x algorithms: stream Q, stream AC, and stream TD, achieving the best model-free performance in DM Control Dog environments. A set of common techniques underlies the stream-x algorithms, enabling their success with a single set of hyperparameters and allowing for easy extension to other algorithms, thereby reviving streaming RL.</description>

      <title>2-Rectifications are Enough for Straight Flows: A Theoretical Insight into Wasserstein Convergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14949v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for image generation and denoising. Typically, generative models learn a trajectory between the starting noise distribution and the target data distribution. Recently Liu et al. (2023b) designed a novel alternative generative model Rectified Flow (RF), which aims to learn straight flow trajectories from noise to data using a sequence of convex optimization problems with close ties to optimal transport. If the trajectory is curved, one must use many Euler discretization steps or novel strategies, such as exponential integrators, to achieve a satisfactory generation quality. In contrast, RF has been shown to theoretically straighten the trajectory through successive rectifications, reducing the number of function evaluations (NFEs) while sampling. It has also been shown empirically that RF may improve the straightness in two rectifications if one can solve the underlying optimization problem within a sufficiently small error. In this paper, we make two key theoretical contributions: 1) we provide the first theoretical analysis of the Wasserstein distance between the sampling distribution of RF and the target distribution. Our error rate is characterized by the number of discretization steps and a \textit{new formulation of straightness} stronger than that in the original work. 2) under a mild regularity assumption, we show that for a rectified flow from a Gaussian to any general target distribution with finite first moment (e.g. mixture of Gaussians), two rectifications are sufficient to achieve a straight flow, which is in line with the previous empirical findings. Additionally, we also present empirical results on both simulated and real datasets to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: For any fixed feedforward ReLU neural network architecture, it is well-known that many different parameter settings can determine the same function. It is less well-known that the degree of this redundancy is inhomogeneous across parameter space. In this work, we discuss two locally applicable complexity measures for ReLU network classes and what we know about the relationship between them: (1) the local functional dimension [14, 18], and (2) a local version of VC dimension that we call persistent pseudodimension. The former is easy to compute on finite batches of points; the latter should give local bounds on the generalization gap, which would inform an understanding of the mechanics of the double descent phenomenon [7].</description>

      <title>Entity-based Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Cyber Defence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A significant challenge for autonomous cyber defence is ensuring a defensive agent's ability to generalise across diverse network topologies and configurations. This capability is necessary for agents to remain effective when deployed in dynamically changing environments, such as an enterprise network where devices may frequently join and leave. Standard approaches to deep reinforcement learning, where policies are parameterised using a fixed-input multi-layer perceptron (MLP) expect fixed-size observation and action spaces. In autonomous cyber defence, this makes it hard to develop agents that generalise to environments with network topologies different from those trained on, as the number of nodes affects the natural size of the observation and action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we reframe the problem of autonomous network defence using entity-based reinforcement learning, where the observation and action space of an agent are decomposed into a collection of discrete entities. This framework enables the use of policy parameterisations specialised in compositional generalisation. We train a Transformer-based policy on the Yawning Titan cyber-security simulation environment and test its generalisation capabilities across various network topologies. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms an MLP-based policy when training across fixed-size networks of varying topologies, and matches performance when training on a single network. We also demonstrate the potential for zero-shot generalisation to networks of a different size to those seen in training. These findings highlight the potential for entity-based reinforcement learning to advance the field of autonomous cyber defence by providing more generalisable policies capable of handling variations in real-world network environments.</description>

Abstract: Unsupervised pretraining has been transformative in many supervised domains. However, applying such ideas to reinforcement learning (RL) presents a unique challenge in that fine-tuning does not involve mimicking task-specific data, but rather exploring and locating the solution through iterative self-improvement. In this work, we study how unlabeled prior trajectory data can be leveraged to learn efficient exploration strategies. While prior data can be used to pretrain a set of low-level skills, or as additional off-policy data for online RL, it has been unclear how to combine these ideas effectively for online exploration. Our method SUPE (Skills from Unlabeled Prior data for Exploration) demonstrates that a careful combination of these ideas compounds their benefits. Our method first extracts low-level skills using a variational autoencoder (VAE), and then pseudo-relabels unlabeled trajectories using an optimistic reward model, transforming prior data into high-level, task-relevant examples. Finally, SUPE uses these transformed examples as additional off-policy data for online RL to learn a high-level policy that composes pretrained low-level skills to explore efficiently. We empirically show that SUPE reliably outperforms prior strategies, successfully solving a suite of long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks. Code: https://github.com/rail-berkeley/supe.</description>

Abstract: Incorporating novelties into deep learning systems remains a challenging problem. Introducing new information to a machine learning system can interfere with previously stored data and potentially alter the global model paradigm, especially when dealing with non-stationary sources. In such cases, traditional approaches based on validation error minimization offer limited advantages. To address this, we propose a training algorithm inspired by Stuart Kauffman's notion of the Adjacent Possible. This novel training methodology explores new data spaces during the learning phase. It predisposes the neural network to smoothly accept and integrate data sequences with different statistical characteristics than expected. The maximum distance compatible with such inclusion depends on a specific parameter: the sampling temperature used in the explorative phase of the present method. This algorithm, called Dreaming Learning, anticipates potential regime shifts over time, enhancing the neural network's responsiveness to non-stationary events that alter statistical properties. To assess the advantages of this approach, we apply this methodology to unexpected statistical changes in Markov chains and non-stationary dynamics in textual sequences. We demonstrated its ability to improve the auto-correlation of generated textual sequences by $\sim 29\%$ and enhance the velocity of loss convergence by $\sim 100\%$ in the case of a paradigm shift in Markov chains.</description>

      <title>Modular Duality in Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An old idea in optimization theory says that since the gradient is a dual vector it may not be subtracted from the weights without first being mapped to the primal space where the weights reside. We take this idea seriously in this paper and construct such a duality map for general neural networks. Our map, which we call modular dualization, forms a unifying theoretical basis for training algorithms that are a) fast and b) scalable. Modular dualization involves first assigning operator norms to layers based on the semantics of each layer, and then using these layerwise norms to recursively induce a duality map on the weight space of the full neural architecture. We conclude by deriving GPU-friendly algorithms for dualizing Embed, Linear and Conv2D layers -- the latter two methods are based on a rectangular Newton-Schulz iteration (Kovarik, 1970; Bj\"orck &amp; Bowie, 1971). A variant of our methods was used to set speed records for training NanoGPT. Overall, we hope that our theory of modular duality will yield a next generation of fast and scalable optimizers for general neural architectures.</description>

      <title>Unlocking State-Tracking in Linear RNNs Through Negative Eigenvalues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (LRNNs) such as Mamba, RWKV, GLA, mLSTM, and DeltaNet have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers in large language modeling, offering linear scaling with sequence length and improved training efficiency. However, LRNNs struggle to perform state-tracking which may impair performance in tasks such as code evaluation or tracking a chess game. Even parity, the simplest state-tracking task, which non-linear RNNs like LSTM handle effectively, cannot be solved by current LRNNs. Recently, Sarrof et al. (2024) demonstrated that the failure of LRNNs like Mamba to solve parity stems from restricting the value range of their diagonal state-transition matrices to $[0, 1]$ and that incorporating negative values can resolve this issue. We extend this result to non-diagonal LRNNs, which have recently shown promise in models such as DeltaNet. We prove that finite precision LRNNs with state-transition matrices having only positive eigenvalues cannot solve parity, while complex eigenvalues are needed to count modulo $3$. Notably, we also prove that LRNNs can learn any regular language when their state-transition matrices are products of identity minus vector outer product matrices, each with eigenvalues in the range $[-1, 1]$. Our empirical results confirm that extending the eigenvalue range of models like Mamba and DeltaNet to include negative values not only enables them to solve parity but consistently improves their performance on state-tracking tasks. Furthermore, pre-training LRNNs with an extended eigenvalue range for language modeling achieves comparable performance and stability while showing promise on code and math data. Our work enhances the expressivity of modern LRNNs, broadening their applicability without changing the cost of training or inference.</description>

      <title>FAMES: Fast Approximate Multiplier Substitution for Mixed-Precision Quantized DNNs--Down to 2 Bits!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A widely-used technique in designing energy-efficient deep neural network (DNN) accelerators is quantization. Recent progress in this direction has reduced the bitwidths used in DNN down to 2. Meanwhile, many prior works apply approximate multipliers (AppMuls) in designing DNN accelerators to lower their energy consumption. Unfortunately, these works still assume a bitwidth much larger than 2, which falls far behind the state-of-the-art in quantization area and even challenges the meaningfulness of applying AppMuls in DNN accelerators, since a high-bitwidth AppMul consumes much more energy than a low-bitwidth exact multiplier! Thus, an important problem to study is: Can approximate multipliers be effectively applied to quantized DNN models with very low bitwidths? In this work, we give an affirmative answer to this question and present a systematic solution that achieves the answer: FAMES, a fast approximate multiplier substitution method for mixed-precision DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate an average 28.67% energy reduction on state-of-the-art mixed-precision quantized models with bitwidths as low as 2 bits and accuracy losses kept under 1%. Additionally, our approach is up to 300x faster than previous genetic algorithm-based methods.</description>

      <title>LLM-ABBA: Understanding time series via symbolic approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) for time series has been demonstrated in previous work. Utilizing a symbolic time series representation, one can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the remaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time series by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the embedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The symbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in preserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in terms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs.
  In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA into large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By symbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to \kc{avoid obvious drifting} during prediction tasks by significantly mitigating the effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the transition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks, LLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) benchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive prediction capability compared to recent SOTA time series prediction results. We believe this framework can also seamlessly extend to other time series tasks.</description>

      <title>Visual Error Patterns in Multi-Modal AI: A Statistical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o, excel at integrating text and visual data but face systematic challenges when interpreting ambiguous or incomplete visual stimuli. This study leverages statistical modeling to analyze the factors driving these errors, using a dataset of geometric stimuli characterized by features like 3D, rotation, and missing face/side. We applied parametric methods, non-parametric methods, and ensemble techniques to predict classification errors, with the non-linear gradient boosting model achieving the highest performance (AUC=0.85) during cross-validation. Feature importance analysis highlighted difficulties in depth perception and reconstructing incomplete structures as key contributors to misclassification. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of statistical approaches for uncovering limitations in MLLMs and offer actionable insights for enhancing model architectures by integrating contextual reasoning mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A Water Efficiency Dataset for African Data Centers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI computing and data centers consume a large amount of freshwater, both directly for cooling and indirectly for electricity generation. While most attention has been paid to developed countries such as the U.S., this paper presents the first-of-its-kind dataset that combines nation-level weather and electricity generation data to estimate water usage efficiency for data centers in 41 African countries across five different climate regions. We also use our dataset to evaluate and estimate the water consumption of inference on two large language models (i.e., Llama-3-70B and GPT-4) in 11 selected African countries. Our findings show that writing a 10-page report using Llama-3-70B could consume about \textbf{0.7 liters} of water, while the water consumption by GPT-4 for the same task may go up to about 60 liters. For writing a medium-length email of 120-200 words, Llama-3-70B and GPT-4 could consume about \textbf{0.13 liters} and 3 liters of water, respectively. Interestingly, given the same AI model, 8 out of the 11 selected African countries consume less water than the global average, mainly because of lower water intensities for electricity generation. However, water consumption can be substantially higher in some African countries with a steppe climate than the U.S. and global averages, prompting more attention when deploying AI computing in these countries. Our dataset is publicly available on \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/masterlion/WaterEfficientDatasetForAfricanCountries/tree/main}{Hugging Face}.</description>

      <title>Local Curvature Smoothing with Stein's Identity for Efficient Score Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The training of score-based diffusion models (SDMs) is based on score matching. The challenge of score matching is that it includes a computationally expensive Jacobian trace. While several methods have been proposed to avoid this computation, each has drawbacks, such as instability during training and approximating the learning as learning a denoising vector field rather than a true score. We propose a novel score matching variant, local curvature smoothing with Stein's identity (LCSS). The LCSS bypasses the Jacobian trace by applying Stein's identity, enabling regularization effectiveness and efficient computation. We show that LCSS surpasses existing methods in sample generation performance and matches the performance of denoising score matching, widely adopted by most SDMs, in evaluations such as FID, Inception score, and bits per dimension. Furthermore, we show that LCSS enables realistic image generation even at a high resolution of $1024 \times 1024$.</description>

      <title>Resolving Intent Ambiguities by Retrieving Discriminative Clarifying Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.07559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Task oriented Dialogue Systems generally employ intent detection systems in order to map user queries to a set of pre-defined intents. However, user queries appearing in natural language can be easily ambiguous and hence such a direct mapping might not be straightforward harming intent detection and eventually the overall performance of a dialogue system. Moreover, acquiring domain-specific clarification questions is costly. In order to disambiguate queries which are ambiguous between two intents, we propose a novel method of generating discriminative questions using a simple rule based system which can take advantage of any question generation system without requiring annotated data of clarification questions. Our approach aims at discrimination between two intents but can be easily extended to clarification over multiple intents. Seeking clarification from the user to classify user intents not only helps understand the user intent effectively, but also reduces the roboticity of the conversation and makes the interaction considerably natural.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Gradient Tracking over Time-varying Graphs for Decentralized Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.02596v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized optimization over time-varying graphs has been increasingly common in modern machine learning with massive data stored on millions of mobile devices, such as in federated learning. This paper revisits the widely used accelerated gradient tracking and extends it to time-varying graphs. We prove that the practical single loop accelerated gradient tracking needs $O((\frac{\gamma}{1-\sigma_{\gamma}})^2\sqrt{\frac{L}{\epsilon}})$ and $O((\frac{\gamma}{1-\sigma_{\gamma}})^{1.5}\sqrt{\frac{L}{\mu}}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ iterations to reach an $\epsilon$-optimal solution over time-varying graphs when the problems are nonstrongly convex and strongly convex, respectively, where $\gamma$ and $\sigma_{\gamma}$ are two common constants charactering the network connectivity, $L$ and $\mu$ are the smoothness and strong convexity constants, respectively, and one iteration corresponds to one gradient oracle call and one communication round. Our convergence rates improve significantly over the ones of $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{5/7}})$ and $O((\frac{L}{\mu})^{5/7}\frac{1}{(1-\sigma)^{1.5}}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$, respectively, which were proved in the original literature of accelerated gradient tracking only for static graphs, where $\frac{\gamma}{1-\sigma_{\gamma}}$ equals $\frac{1}{1-\sigma}$ when the network is time-invariant. When combining with a multiple consensus subroutine, the dependence on the network connectivity constants can be further improved to $O(1)$ and $O(\frac{\gamma}{1-\sigma_{\gamma}})$ for the gradient oracle and communication round complexities, respectively. When the network is static, by employing the Chebyshev acceleration, our complexities exactly match the lower bounds without hiding any poly-logarithmic factor for both nonstrongly convex and strongly convex problems.</description>

Abstract: In this work we propose a stochastic primal-dual three-operator splitting algorithm (TOS-SPDHG) for solving a class of convex three-composite optimization problems. Our proposed scheme is a direct three-operator splitting extension of the SPDHG algorithm [Chambolle et al. 2018]. We provide theoretical convergence analysis showing ergodic $O(1/K)$ convergence rate, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in imaging inverse problems. Moreover, we further propose TOS-SPDHG-RED and TOS-SPDHG-eRED which utilizes the regularization-by-denoising (RED) framework to leverage pretrained deep denoising networks as priors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The research community has shown increasing interest in designing intelligent embodied agents that can assist humans in accomplishing tasks. Although there have been significant advancements in related vision-language benchmarks, most prior work has focused on building agents that follow instructions rather than endowing agents the ability to ask questions to actively resolve ambiguities arising naturally in embodied environments. To address this gap, we propose an Embodied Learning-By-Asking (ELBA) model that learns when and what questions to ask to dynamically acquire additional information for completing the task. We evaluate ELBA on the TEACh vision-dialog navigation and task completion dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves improved task performance compared to baseline models without question-answering capabilities.</description>

      <title>What can we learn from quantum convolutional neural networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) shows promise for analyzing quantum data. A notable example is the use of quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), implemented as specific types of quantum circuits, to recognize phases of matter. In this approach, ground states of many-body Hamiltonians are prepared to form a quantum dataset and classified in a supervised manner using only a few labeled examples. However, this type of dataset and model differs fundamentally from typical QML paradigms based on feature maps and parameterized circuits. In this study, we demonstrate how models utilizing quantum data can be interpreted through hidden feature maps, where physical features are implicitly embedded via ground-state feature maps. By analyzing selected examples previously explored with QCNNs, we show that high performance in quantum phase recognition comes from generating a highly effective basis set with sharp features at critical points. The learning process adapts the measurement to create sharp decision boundaries. Our analysis highlights improved generalization when working with quantum data, particularly in the limited-shots regime. Furthermore, translating these insights into the domain of quantum scientific machine learning, we demonstrate that ground-state feature maps can be applied to fluid dynamics problems, expressing shock wave solutions with good generalization and proven trainability.</description>

      <title>Memorization With Neural Nets: Going Beyond the Worst Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In practice, deep neural networks are often able to easily interpolate their training data. To understand this phenomenon, many works have aimed to quantify the memorization capacity of a neural network architecture: the largest number of points such that the architecture can interpolate any placement of these points with any assignment of labels. For real-world data, however, one intuitively expects the presence of a benign structure so that interpolation already occurs at a smaller network size than suggested by memorization capacity. In this paper, we investigate interpolation by adopting an instance-specific viewpoint. We introduce a simple randomized algorithm that, given a fixed finite data set with two classes, with high probability constructs an interpolating three-layer neural network in polynomial time. The required number of parameters is linked to geometric properties of the two classes and their mutual arrangement. As a result, we obtain guarantees that are independent of the number of samples and hence move beyond worst-case memorization capacity bounds. We verify our theoretical result with numerical experiments and additionally investigate the effectiveness of the algorithm on MNIST and CIFAR-10.</description>

      <title>Iterative Methods for Vecchia-Laplace Approximations for Latent Gaussian Process Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12000v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Latent Gaussian process (GP) models are flexible probabilistic non-parametric function models. Vecchia approximations are accurate approximations for GPs to overcome computational bottlenecks for large data, and the Laplace approximation is a fast method with asymptotic convergence guarantees to approximate marginal likelihoods and posterior predictive distributions for non-Gaussian likelihoods. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of combined Vecchia-Laplace approximations grows faster than linearly in the sample size when used in combination with direct solver methods such as the Cholesky decomposition. Computations with Vecchia-Laplace approximations can thus become prohibitively slow precisely when the approximations are usually the most accurate, i.e., on large data sets. In this article, we present iterative methods to overcome this drawback. Among other things, we introduce and analyze several preconditioners, derive new convergence results, and propose novel methods for accurately approximating predictive variances. We analyze our proposed methods theoretically and in experiments with simulated and real-world data. In particular, we obtain a speed-up of an order of magnitude compared to Cholesky-based calculations and a threefold increase in prediction accuracy in terms of the continuous ranked probability score compared to a state-of-the-art method on a large satellite data set. All methods are implemented in a free C++ software library with high-level Python and R packages.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive framework for evaluation of deep neural networks in detection and quantification of lymphoma from PET/CT images: clinical insights, pitfalls, and observer agreement analyses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09614v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses critical gaps in automated lymphoma segmentation from PET/CT images, focusing on issues often overlooked in existing literature. While deep learning has been applied for lymphoma lesion segmentation, few studies incorporate out-of-distribution testing, raising concerns about model generalizability across diverse imaging conditions and patient populations. We highlight the need to compare model performance with expert human annotators, including intra- and inter-observer variability, to understand task difficulty better. Most approaches focus on overall segmentation accuracy but overlook lesion-specific measures important for precise lesion detection and disease quantification. To address these gaps, we propose a clinically relevant framework for evaluating deep segmentation networks. Using this lesion measure-specific evaluation, we assess the performance of four deep networks (ResUNet, SegResNet, DynUNet, and SwinUNETR) across 611 cases from multi-institutional datasets, covering various lymphoma subtypes and lesion characteristics. Beyond standard metrics like the Dice similarity coefficient, we evaluate clinical lesion measures and their prediction errors. We also introduce detection criteria for lesion localization and propose a new detection Criterion 3 based on metabolic characteristics. We show that networks perform better on large, intense lesions with higher metabolic activity. Finally, we compare network performance to physicians via intra- and inter-observer variability analyses, demonstrating that network errors closely resemble those made by experts, i.e., the small and faint lesions remain challenging for both humans and networks. This study aims to improve automated lesion segmentation's clinical relevance, supporting better treatment decisions for lymphoma patients.

Abstract: Recent advancements in robotics have enabled robots to navigate complex scenes or manipulate diverse objects independently. However, robots are still impotent in many household tasks requiring coordinated behaviors such as opening doors. The factorization of navigation and manipulation, while effective for some tasks, fails in scenarios requiring coordinated actions. To address this challenge, we introduce, HarmonicMM, an end-to-end learning method that optimizes both navigation and manipulation, showing notable improvement over existing techniques in everyday tasks. This approach is validated in simulated and real-world environments and adapts to novel unseen settings without additional tuning. Our contributions include a new benchmark for mobile manipulation and the successful deployment with only RGB visual observation in a real unseen apartment, demonstrating the potential for practical indoor robot deployment in daily life.

      <title>Voronoi Candidates for Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) offers an elegant approach for efficiently optimizing black-box functions. However, acquisition criteria demand their own challenging inner-optimization, which can induce significant overhead. Many practical BO methods, particularly in high dimension, eschew a formal, continuous optimization of the acquisition function and instead search discretely over a finite set of space-filling candidates. Here, we propose to use candidates which lie on the boundary of the Voronoi tessellation of the current design points, so they are equidistant to two or more of them. We discuss strategies for efficient implementation by directly sampling the Voronoi boundary without explicitly generating the tessellation, thus accommodating large designs in high dimension. On a battery of test problems optimized via Gaussian processes with expected improvement, our proposed approach significantly improves the execution time of a multi-start continuous search without a loss in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Mixup Barcodes: Quantifying Geometric-Topological Interactions between Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine standard persistent homology with image persistent homology to define a novel way of characterizing shapes and interactions between them. In particular, we introduce: (1) a mixup barcode, which captures geometric-topological interactions (mixup) between two point sets in arbitrary dimension; (2) simple summary statistics, total mixup and total percentage mixup, which quantify the complexity of the interactions as a single number; (3) a software tool for playing with the above.
  As a proof of concept, we apply this tool to a problem arising from machine learning. In particular, we study the disentanglement in embeddings of different classes. The results suggest that topological mixup is a useful method for characterizing interactions for low and high-dimensional data. Compared to the typical usage of persistent homology, the new tool is sensitive to the geometric locations of the topological features, which is often desirable.</description>

      <title>Colour and Brush Stroke Pattern Recognition in Abstract Art using Modified Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Abstract Art is an immensely popular, discussed form of art that often has the ability to depict the emotions of an artist. Many researchers have made attempts to study abstract art in the form of edge detection, brush stroke and emotion recognition algorithms using machine and deep learning. This papers describes the study of a wide distribution of abstract paintings using Generative Adversarial Neural Networks(GAN). GANs have the ability to learn and reproduce a distribution enabling researchers and scientists to effectively explore and study the generated image space. However, the challenge lies in developing an efficient GAN architecture that overcomes common training pitfalls. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a modified-DCGAN (mDCGAN) specifically designed for high-quality artwork generation. The approach involves a thorough exploration of the modifications made, delving into the intricate workings of DCGANs, optimisation techniques, and regularisation methods aimed at improving stability and realism in art generation enabling effective study of generated patterns. The proposed mDCGAN incorporates meticulous adjustments in layer configurations and architectural choices, offering tailored solutions to the unique demands of art generation while effectively combating issues like mode collapse and gradient vanishing. Further this paper explores the generated latent space by performing random walks to understand vector relationships between brush strokes and colours in the abstract art space and a statistical analysis of unstable outputs after a certain period of GAN training and compare its significant difference. These findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, emphasising its potential to revolutionise the field of digital art generation and digital art ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Toward Routing River Water in Land Surface Models with Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14212v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is playing an increasing role in hydrology, supplementing or replacing physics-based models. One notable example is the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for forecasting streamflow given observed precipitation and geographic characteristics. Training of such a model over the continental United States (CONUS) has demonstrated that a single set of model parameters can be used across independent catchments, and that RNNs can outperform physics-based models. In this work, we take a next step and study the performance of RNNs for river routing in land surface models (LSMs). Instead of observed precipitation, the LSM-RNN uses instantaneous runoff calculated from physics-based models as an input. We train the model with data from river basins spanning the globe and test it using historical streamflow measurements. The model demonstrates skill at generalization across basins (predicting streamflow in catchments not used in training) and across time (predicting streamflow during years not used in training). We compare the predictions from the LSM-RNN to an existing physics-based model calibrated with a similar dataset and find that the LSM-RNN outperforms the physics-based model: a gain in median NSE from 0.56 to 0.64 (time-split experiment) and from 0.30 to 0.34 (basin-split experiment). Our results show that RNNs are effective for global streamflow prediction from runoff inputs and motivate the development of complete routing models that can capture nested sub-basis connections.</description>

      <title>Investigating Self-Supervised Image Denoising with Denaturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01124v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning for image denoising problems in the presence of denaturation for noisy data is a crucial approach in machine learning. However, theoretical understanding of the performance of the approach that uses denatured data is lacking. To provide better understanding of the approach, in this paper, we analyze a self-supervised denoising algorithm that uses denatured data in depth through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. Through the theoretical analysis, we discuss that the algorithm finds desired solutions to the optimization problem with the population risk, while the guarantee for the empirical risk depends on the hardness of the denoising task in terms of denaturation levels. We also conduct several experiments to investigate the performance of an extended algorithm in practice. The results indicate that the algorithm training with denatured images works, and the empirical performance aligns with the theoretical results. These results suggest several insights for further improvement of self-supervised image denoising that uses denatured data in future directions.</description>

      <title>Jointly Modeling Inter- &amp; Intra-Modality Dependencies for Multi-modal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supervised multi-modal learning involves mapping multiple modalities to a target label. Previous studies in this field have concentrated on capturing in isolation either the inter-modality dependencies (the relationships between different modalities and the label) or the intra-modality dependencies (the relationships within a single modality and the label). We argue that these conventional approaches that rely solely on either inter- or intra-modality dependencies may not be optimal in general. We view the multi-modal learning problem from the lens of generative models where we consider the target as a source of multiple modalities and the interaction between them. Towards that end, we propose inter- &amp; intra-modality modeling (I2M2) framework, which captures and integrates both the inter- and intra-modality dependencies, leading to more accurate predictions. We evaluate our approach using real-world healthcare and vision-and-language datasets with state-of-the-art models, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods focusing only on one type of modality dependency.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Practical Perceptual Hashing Algorithms to Hash-Evasion and Hash-Inversion Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perceptual hashing algorithms (PHAs) are widely used for identifying illegal online content and are thus integral to various sensitive applications. However, due to their hasty deployment in real-world scenarios, their adversarial security has not been thoroughly evaluated. This paper assesses the security of three widely utilized PHAs - PhotoDNA, PDQ, and NeuralHash - against hash-evasion and hash-inversion attacks. Contrary to existing literature, our findings indicate that these PHAs demonstrate significant robustness against such attacks. We provide an explanation for these differing results, highlighting that the inherent robustness is partially due to the random hash variations characteristic of PHAs. Additionally, we propose a defense method that enhances security by intentionally introducing perturbations into the hashes.</description>

      <title>LLM-Enhanced Bayesian Optimization for Efficient Analog Layout Constraint Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05250v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog layout synthesis faces significant challenges due to its dependence on manual processes, considerable time requirements, and performance instability. Current Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based techniques for analog layout synthesis, despite their potential for automation, suffer from slow convergence and extensive data needs, limiting their practical application. This paper presents the \texttt{LLANA} framework, a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance BO by exploiting the few-shot learning abilities of LLMs for more efficient generation of analog design-dependent parameter constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that \texttt{LLANA} not only achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) BO methods but also enables a more effective exploration of the analog circuit design space, thanks to LLM's superior contextual understanding and learning efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/dekura/LLANA.</description>

      <title>MultiTrust: A Comprehensive Benchmark Towards Trustworthy Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the superior capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, they still face significant trustworthiness challenges. Yet, current literature on the assessment of trustworthy MLLMs remains limited, lacking a holistic evaluation to offer thorough insights into future improvements. In this work, we establish MultiTrust, the first comprehensive and unified benchmark on the trustworthiness of MLLMs across five primary aspects: truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. Our benchmark employs a rigorous evaluation strategy that addresses both multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts, encompassing 32 diverse tasks with self-curated datasets. Extensive experiments with 21 modern MLLMs reveal some previously unexplored trustworthiness issues and risks, highlighting the complexities introduced by the multimodality and underscoring the necessity for advanced methodologies to enhance their reliability. For instance, typical proprietary models still struggle with the perception of visually confusing images and are vulnerable to multimodal jailbreaking and adversarial attacks; MLLMs are more inclined to disclose privacy in text and reveal ideological and cultural biases even when paired with irrelevant images in inference, indicating that the multimodality amplifies the internal risks from base LLMs. Additionally, we release a scalable toolbox for standardized trustworthiness research, aiming to facilitate future advancements in this important field. Code and resources are publicly available at: https://multi-trust.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Job Shop Scheduling Problems: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Job shop scheduling problems (JSSPs) represent a critical and challenging class of combinatorial optimization problems. Recent years have witnessed a rapid increase in the application of graph neural networks (GNNs) to solve JSSPs, albeit lacking a systematic survey of the relevant literature. This paper aims to thoroughly review prevailing GNN methods for different types of JSSPs and the closely related flow-shop scheduling problems (FSPs), especially those leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We begin by presenting the graph representations of various JSSPs, followed by an introduction to the most commonly used GNN architectures. We then review current GNN-based methods for each problem type, highlighting key technical elements such as graph representations, GNN architectures, GNN tasks, and training algorithms. Finally, we summarize and analyze the advantages and limitations of GNNs in solving JSSPs and provide potential future research opportunities. We hope this survey can motivate and inspire innovative approaches for more powerful GNN-based approaches in tackling JSSPs and other scheduling problems.</description>

      <title>NeuroNAS: A Framework for Energy-Efficient Neuromorphic Compute-in-Memory Systems using Hardware-Aware Spiking Neural Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated capabilities for solving diverse machine learning tasks with ultra-low power/energy consumption. To maximize the performance and efficiency of SNN inference, the Compute-in-Memory (CIM) hardware accelerators with emerging device technologies (e.g., RRAM) have been employed. However, SNN architectures are typically developed without considering constraints from the application and the underlying CIM hardware, thereby hindering SNNs from reaching their full potential in accuracy and efficiency. To address this, we propose NeuroNAS, a novel framework for developing energy-efficient neuromorphic CIM systems using a hardware-aware spiking neural architecture search (NAS), i.e., by quickly finding an SNN architecture that offers high accuracy under the given constraints (e.g., memory, area, latency, and energy consumption). NeuroNAS employs the following key steps: (1) optimizing SNN operations to enable efficient NAS, (2) employing quantization to minimize the memory footprint, (3) developing an SNN architecture that facilitates an effective learning, and (4) devising a systematic hardware-aware search algorithm to meet the constraints. Compared to the state-of-the-art, NeuroNAS with 8bit weight precision quickly finds SNNs that maintain high accuracy by up to 6.6x search time speed-ups, while achieving up to 92% area savings, 1.2x latency speed-ups, 84% energy savings across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet-200 datasets; while the state-of-the-art fail to meet all constraints at once. In this manner, NeuroNAS enables efficient design automation in developing energy-efficient neuromorphic CIM systems for diverse ML-based applications.</description>

      <title>SwiftDiffusion: Efficient Diffusion Model Serving with Add-on Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation using diffusion models has become a blockbuster service in today's AI cloud. A production T2I service typically involves a serving workflow where a base diffusion model is augmented with various "add-on" modules, notably ControlNet and LoRA, to enhance image generation control. Compared to serving the base model alone, these add-on modules introduce significant loading and computational overhead, resulting in increased latency. In this paper, we present SwiftDiffusion, a system that efficiently serves a T2I workflow through a holistic approach. SwiftDiffusion decouples ControNet from the base model and deploys it as a separate, independently scaled service on dedicated GPUs, enabling ControlNet caching, parallelization, and sharing. To mitigate the high loading overhead of LoRA serving, SwiftDiffusion employs a bounded asynchronous LoRA loading (BAL) technique, allowing LoRA loading to overlap with the initial base model execution by up to k steps without compromising image quality. Furthermore, SwiftDiffusion optimizes base model execution with a novel latent parallelism technique. Collectively, these designs enable SwiftDiffusion to outperform the state-of-the-art T2I serving systems, achieving up to 7.8x latency reduction and 1.6x throughput improvement in serving SDXL models on H800 GPUs, without sacrificing image quality.</description>

      <title>LayerShuffle: Enhancing Robustness in Vision Transformers by Randomizing Layer Execution Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to their architecture and how they are trained, artificial neural networks are typically not robust toward pruning or shuffling layers at test time. However, such properties would be desirable for different applications, such as distributed neural network architectures where the order of execution cannot be guaranteed or parts of the network can fail during inference. In this work, we address these issues through a number of training approaches for vision transformers whose most important component is randomizing the execution order of attention modules at training time. With our proposed approaches, vision transformers are capable to adapt to arbitrary layer execution orders at test time assuming one tolerates a reduction (about 20\%) in accuracy at the same model size. We analyse the feature representations of our trained models as well as how each layer contributes to the models prediction based on its position during inference. Our analysis shows that layers learn to contribute differently based on their position in the network. Finally, we layer-prune our models at test time and find that their performance declines gracefully. Code available at https://github.com/matfrei/layershuffle.</description>

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegeneration, annually diagnosed in millions of patients. The present medicine scenario still finds challenges in the exact diagnosis and classification of AD through neuroimaging data. Traditional CNNs can extract a good amount of low-level information in an image but fail to extract high-level minuscule particles, which is a significant challenge in detecting AD from MRI scans. To overcome this, we propose a novel Granular Feature Integration method to combine information extraction at different scales combined with an efficient information flow, enabling the model to capture both broad and fine-grained features simultaneously. We also propose a Bi-Focal Perspective mechanism to highlight the subtle neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques in the MRI scans, ensuring that critical pathological markers are accurately identified. Our model achieved an F1-Score of 99.31%, precision of 99.24%, and recall of 99.51%. These scores prove that our model is significantly better than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) CNNs in existence.</description>

      <title>Cybench: A Framework for Evaluating Cybersecurity Capabilities and Risks of Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language Model (LM) agents for cybersecurity that are capable of autonomously identifying vulnerabilities and executing exploits have potential to cause real-world impact. Policymakers, model providers, and researchers in the AI and cybersecurity communities are interested in quantifying the capabilities of such agents to help mitigate cyberrisk and investigate opportunities for penetration testing. Toward that end, we introduce Cybench, a framework for specifying cybersecurity tasks and evaluating agents on those tasks. We include 40 professional-level Capture the Flag (CTF) tasks from 4 distinct CTF competitions, chosen to be recent, meaningful, and spanning a wide range of difficulties. Each task includes its own description, starter files, and is initialized in an environment where an agent can execute commands and observe outputs. Since many tasks are beyond the capabilities of existing LM agents, we introduce subtasks for each task, which break down a task into intermediary steps for a more detailed evaluation. To evaluate agent capabilities, we construct a cybersecurity agent and evaluate 8 models: GPT-4o, OpenAI o1-preview, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mixtral 8x22b Instruct, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B Chat, and Llama 3.1 405B Instruct. For the top performing models (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet), we further investigate performance across 4 agent scaffolds (structed bash, action-only, pseudoterminal, and web search). Without subtask guidance, agents leveraging Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, OpenAI o1-preview, and Claude 3 Opus successfully solved complete tasks that took human teams up to 11 minutes to solve. In comparison, the most difficult task took human teams 24 hours and 54 minutes to solve. All code and data are publicly available at https://cybench.github.io.</description>

      <title>PADetBench: Towards Benchmarking Physical Attacks against Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical attacks against object detection have gained increasing attention due to their significant practical implications. However, conducting physical experiments is extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, physical dynamics and cross-domain transformation are challenging to strictly regulate in the real world, leading to unaligned evaluation and comparison, severely hindering the development of physically robust models. To accommodate these challenges, we explore utilizing realistic simulation to thoroughly and rigorously benchmark physical attacks with fairness under controlled physical dynamics and cross-domain transformation. This resolves the problem of capturing identical adversarial images that cannot be achieved in the real world. Our benchmark includes 20 physical attack methods, 48 object detectors, comprehensive physical dynamics, and evaluation metrics. We also provide end-to-end pipelines for dataset generation, detection, evaluation, and further analysis. In addition, we perform 8064 groups of evaluation based on our benchmark, which includes both overall evaluation and further detailed ablation studies for controlled physical dynamics. Through these experiments, we provide in-depth analyses of physical attack performance and physical adversarial robustness, draw valuable observations, and discuss potential directions for future research.

      <title>A Practitioner's Guide to Continual Multimodal Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal foundation models serve numerous applications at the intersection of vision and language. Still, despite being pretrained on extensive data, they become outdated over time. To keep models updated, research into continual pretraining mainly explores scenarios with either (1) infrequent, indiscriminate updates on large-scale new data, or (2) frequent, sample-level updates. However, practical model deployment often operates in the gap between these two limit cases, as real-world applications often demand adaptation to specific subdomains, tasks or concepts -- spread over the entire, varying life cycle of a model. In this work, we complement current perspectives on continual pretraining through a research test bed as well as provide comprehensive guidance for effective continual model updates in such scenarios. We first introduce FoMo-in-Flux, a continual multimodal pretraining benchmark with realistic compute constraints and practical deployment requirements, constructed over 63 datasets with diverse visual and semantic coverage. Using FoMo-in-Flux, we explore the complex landscape of practical continual pretraining through multiple perspectives: (1) A data-centric investigation of data mixtures and stream orderings that emulate real-world deployment situations, (2) a method-centric investigation ranging from simple fine-tuning and traditional continual learning strategies to parameter-efficient updates and model merging, (3) meta learning rate schedules and mechanistic design choices, and (4) the influence of model and compute scaling. Together, our insights provide a practitioner's guide to continual multimodal pretraining for real-world deployment. Our benchmark and code is here: https://github.com/ExplainableML/fomo_in_flux.</description>

      <title>Ethical and Scalable Automation: A Governance and Compliance Framework for Business Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The popularisation of applying AI in businesses poses significant challenges relating to ethical principles, governance, and legal compliance. Although businesses have embedded AI into their day-to-day processes, they lack a unified approach for mitigating its potential risks. This paper introduces a framework ensuring that AI must be ethical, controllable, viable, and desirable. Balancing these factors ensures the design of a framework that addresses its trade-offs, such as balancing performance against explainability. A successful framework provides practical advice for businesses to meet regulatory requirements in sectors such as finance and healthcare, where it is critical to comply with standards like GPDR and the EU AI Act. Different case studies validate this framework by integrating AI in both academic and practical environments. For instance, large language models are cost-effective alternatives for generating synthetic opinions that emulate attitudes to environmental issues. These case studies demonstrate how having a structured framework could enhance transparency and maintain performance levels as shown from the alignment between synthetic and expected distributions. This alignment is quantified using metrics like Chi-test scores, normalized mutual information, and Jaccard indexes. Future research should explore the framework's empirical validation in diverse industrial settings further, ensuring the model's scalability and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Language-Image Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) embed aligned image-text pairs into a joint space but often rely on deterministic embeddings, assuming a one-to-one correspondence between images and texts. This oversimplifies real-world relationships, which are inherently many-to-many, with multiple captions describing a single image and vice versa. We introduce Probabilistic Language-Image Pre-training (ProLIP), the first probabilistic VLM pre-trained on a billion-scale image-text dataset using only probabilistic objectives, achieving a strong zero-shot capability (e.g., 74.6% ImageNet zero-shot accuracy with ViT-B/16). ProLIP efficiently estimates uncertainty by an "uncertainty token" without extra parameters. We also introduce a novel inclusion loss that enforces distributional inclusion relationships between image-text pairs and between original and masked inputs. Experiments demonstrate that, by leveraging uncertainty estimates, ProLIP benefits downstream tasks and aligns with intuitive notions of uncertainty, e.g., shorter texts being more uncertain and more general inputs including specific ones. Utilizing text uncertainties, we further improve ImageNet accuracy from 74.6% to 75.8% (under a few-shot setting), supporting the practical advantages of our probabilistic approach.

      <title>Cross-modal semantic segmentation for indoor environmental perception using single-chip millimeter-wave radar raw data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of firefighting and rescue operations, a cross-modal semantic segmentation model based on a single-chip millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar for indoor environmental perception is proposed and discussed. To efficiently obtain high-quality labels, an automatic label generation method utilizing LiDAR point clouds and occupancy grid maps is introduced. The proposed segmentation model is based on U-Net. A spatial attention module is incorporated, which enhanced the performance of the mode. The results demonstrate that cross-modal semantic segmentation provides a more intuitive and accurate representation of indoor environments. Unlike traditional methods, the model's segmentation performance is minimally affected by azimuth. Although performance declines with increasing distance, this can be mitigated by a well-designed model. Additionally, it was found that using raw ADC data as input is ineffective; compared to RA tensors, RD tensors are more suitable for the proposed model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional neural networks (multi-layer perceptrons) have become an important tool in data science due to their success across a wide range of tasks. However, their performance is sometimes unsatisfactory, and they often require a large number of parameters, primarily due to their reliance on the linear combination structure. Meanwhile, additive regression has been a popular alternative to linear regression in statistics. In this work, we introduce novel deep neural networks that incorporate the idea of additive regression. Our neural networks share architectural similarities with Kolmogorov-Arnold networks but are based on simpler yet flexible activation and basis functions. Additionally, we introduce several hybrid neural networks that combine this architecture with that of traditional neural networks. We derive their universal approximation properties and demonstrate their effectiveness through simulation studies and a real-data application. The numerical results indicate that our neural networks generally achieve better performance than traditional neural networks while using fewer parameters.</description>

Abstract: A multichannel extension to the RVQGAN neural coding method is proposed, and realized for data-driven compression of third-order Ambisonics audio. The input- and output layers of the generator and discriminator models are modified to accept multiple (16) channels without increasing the model bitrate. We also propose a loss function for accounting for spatial perception in immersive reproduction, and transfer learning from single-channel models. Listening test results with 7.1.4 immersive playback show that the proposed extension is suitable for coding scene-based, 16-channel Ambisonics content with good quality at 16 kbps.</description>

      <title>SPARKLE: A Unified Single-Loop Primal-Dual Framework for Decentralized Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies decentralized bilevel optimization, in which multiple agents collaborate to solve problems involving nested optimization structures with neighborhood communications. Most existing literature primarily utilizes gradient tracking to mitigate the influence of data heterogeneity, without exploring other well-known heterogeneity-correction techniques such as EXTRA or Exact Diffusion. Additionally, these studies often employ identical decentralized strategies for both upper- and lower-level problems, neglecting to leverage distinct mechanisms across different levels. To address these limitations, this paper proposes SPARKLE, a unified Single-loop Primal-dual AlgoRithm frameworK for decentraLized bilEvel optimization. SPARKLE offers the flexibility to incorporate various heterogeneitycorrection strategies into the algorithm. Moreover, SPARKLE allows for different strategies to solve upper- and lower-level problems. We present a unified convergence analysis for SPARKLE, applicable to all its variants, with state-of-the-art convergence rates compared to existing decentralized bilevel algorithms. Our results further reveal that EXTRA and Exact Diffusion are more suitable for decentralized bilevel optimization, and using mixed strategies in bilevel algorithms brings more benefits than relying solely on gradient tracking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for accurate clinical diagnoses, yet it faces challenges such as low contrast between lesions and normal tissues, unclear boundaries, and high variability across patients. Deep learning has improved segmentation accuracy and efficiency, but it still relies heavily on expert annotations and struggles with the complexities of medical images. The small size of medical image datasets and the high cost of data acquisition further limit the performance of segmentation networks. Diffusion models, with their iterative denoising process, offer a promising alternative for better detail capture in segmentation. However, they face difficulties in accurately segmenting small targets and maintaining the precision of boundary details. This article discusses the importance of medical image segmentation, the limitations of current deep learning approaches, and the potential of diffusion models to address these challenges.</description>

      <title>LongVALE: Vision-Audio-Language-Event Benchmark Towards Time-Aware Omni-Modal Perception of Long Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite impressive advancements in video understanding, most efforts remain limited to coarse-grained or visual-only video tasks. However, real-world videos encompass omni-modal information (vision, audio, and speech) with a series of events forming a cohesive storyline. The lack of multi-modal video data with fine-grained event annotations and the high cost of manual labeling are major obstacles to comprehensive omni-modality video perception. To address this gap, we propose an automatic pipeline consisting of high-quality multi-modal video filtering, semantically coherent omni-modal event boundary detection, and cross-modal correlation-aware event captioning. In this way, we present LongVALE, the first-ever Vision-Audio-Language Event understanding benchmark comprising 105K omni-modal events with precise temporal boundaries and detailed relation-aware captions within 8.4K high-quality long videos. Further, we build a baseline that leverages LongVALE to enable video large language models (LLMs) for omni-modality fine-grained temporal video understanding for the first time. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and great potential of LongVALE in advancing comprehensive multi-modal video understanding.</description>

      <title>Another look at inference after prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prediction-based (PB) inference is increasingly used in applications where the outcome of interest is difficult to obtain, but its predictors are readily available. Unlike traditional inference, PB inference performs statistical inference using a partially observed outcome and a set of covariates by leveraging a prediction of the outcome generated from a machine learning (ML) model. Motwani and Witten (2023) recently revisited two innovative PB inference approaches for ordinary least squares. They found that the method proposed by Wang et al. (2020) yields a consistent estimator for the association of interest when the ML model perfectly captures the underlying regression function. Conversely, the prediction-powered inference (PPI) method proposed by Angelopoulos et al. (2023) yields valid inference regardless of the model's accuracy. In this paper, we study the statistical efficiency of the PPI estimator. Our analysis reveals that a more efficient estimator, proposed 25 years ago by Chen and Chen (2000), can be obtained by simply adding a weight to the PPI estimator. We also contextualize PB inference with methods from the economics and statistics literature dating back to the 1960s. Our extensive theoretical and numerical analyses indicate that the Chen and Chen (CC) estimator offers a balance between robustness to ML model specification and statistical efficiency, making it the preferred choice for use in practice.</description>

      <title>Robot Learning with Super-Linear Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling robot learning requires data collection pipelines that scale favorably with human effort. In this work, we propose Crowdsourcing and Amortizing Human Effort for Real-to-Sim-to-Real(CASHER), a pipeline for scaling up data collection and learning in simulation where the performance scales superlinearly with human effort. The key idea is to crowdsource digital twins of real-world scenes using 3D reconstruction and collect large-scale data in simulation, rather than the real-world. Data collection in simulation is initially driven by RL, bootstrapped with human demonstrations. As the training of a generalist policy progresses across environments, its generalization capabilities can be used to replace human effort with model generated demonstrations. This results in a pipeline where behavioral data is collected in simulation with continually reducing human effort. We show that CASHER demonstrates zero-shot and few-shot scaling laws on three real-world tasks across diverse scenarios. We show that CASHER enables fine-tuning of pre-trained policies to a target scenario using a video scan without any additional human effort.

      <title>MQFL-FHE: Multimodal Quantum Federated Learning Framework with Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) in federated learning (FL) has led to significant advances in data privacy. However, during the aggregation phase, it often results in performance degradation of the aggregated model, hindering the development of robust representational generalization. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal quantum federated learning framework that utilizes quantum computing to counteract the performance drop resulting from FHE. For the first time in FL, our framework combines a multimodal quantum mixture of experts (MQMoE) model with FHE, incorporating multimodal datasets for enriched representation and task-specific learning. Our MQMoE framework enhances performance on multimodal datasets and combined genomics and brain MRI scans, especially for underrepresented categories. Our results also demonstrate that the quantum-enhanced approach mitigates the performance degradation associated with FHE and improves classification accuracy across diverse datasets, validating the potential of quantum interventions in enhancing privacy in FL.</description>

      <title>Memory-efficient Continual Learning with Neural Collapse Contrastive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has significantly improved representation quality, enhancing knowledge transfer across tasks in continual learning (CL). However, catastrophic forgetting remains a key challenge, as contrastive based methods primarily focus on "soft relationships" or "softness" between samples, which shift with changing data distributions and lead to representation overlap across tasks. Recently, the newly identified Neural Collapse phenomenon has shown promise in CL by focusing on "hard relationships" or "hardness" between samples and fixed prototypes. However, this approach overlooks "softness", crucial for capturing intra-class variability, and this rigid focus can also pull old class representations toward current ones, increasing forgetting. Building on these insights, we propose Focal Neural Collapse Contrastive (FNC^2), a novel representation learning loss that effectively balances both soft and hard relationships. Additionally, we introduce the Hardness-Softness Distillation (HSD) loss to progressively preserve the knowledge gained from these relationships across tasks. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in minimizing memory reliance. Remarkably, even without the use of memory, our approach rivals rehearsal-based methods, offering a compelling solution for data privacy concerns.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning in Single-Cell and Spatial Transcriptomics Data Analysis: Advances and Challenges from a Data Science Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics has revolutionized our capacity to investigate cellular properties, functions, and interactions in both cellular and spatial contexts. However, the analysis of single-cell and spatial omics data remains challenging. First, single-cell sequencing data are high-dimensional and sparse, often contaminated by noise and uncertainty, obscuring the underlying biological signals. Second, these data often encompass multiple modalities, including gene expression, epigenetic modifications, and spatial locations. Integrating these diverse data modalities is crucial for enhancing prediction accuracy and biological interpretability. Third, while the scale of single-cell sequencing has expanded to millions of cells, high-quality annotated datasets are still limited. Fourth, the complex correlations of biological tissues make it difficult to accurately reconstruct cellular states and spatial contexts. Traditional feature engineering-based analysis methods struggle to deal with the various challenges presented by intricate biological networks. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool capable of handling high-dimensional complex data and automatically identifying meaningful patterns, offering significant promise in addressing these challenges. This review systematically analyzes these challenges and discusses related deep learning approaches. Moreover, we have curated 21 datasets from 9 benchmarks, encompassing 58 computational methods, and evaluated their performance on the respective modeling tasks. Finally, we highlight three areas for future development from a technical, dataset, and application perspective. This work will serve as a valuable resource for understanding how deep learning can be effectively utilized in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses, while inspiring novel approaches to address emerging challenges.</description>

      <title>Scaling Inference-Time Search with Vision Value Model for Improved Visual Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in vision-language models (VLMs), there lacks effective approaches to enhance response quality by scaling inference-time computation. This capability is known to be a core step towards the self-improving models in recent large language model studies. In this paper, we present Vision Value Model (VisVM) that can guide VLM inference-time search to generate responses with better visual comprehension. Specifically, VisVM not only evaluates the generated sentence quality in the current search step, but also anticipates the quality of subsequent sentences that may result from the current step, thus providing a long-term value. In this way, VisVM steers VLMs away from generating sentences prone to hallucinations or insufficient detail, thereby producing higher quality responses. Experimental results demonstrate that VisVM-guided search significantly enhances VLMs' ability to generate descriptive captions with richer visual details and fewer hallucinations, compared with greedy decoding and search methods with other visual reward signals. Furthermore, we find that self-training the model with the VisVM-guided captions improve VLM's performance across a wide range of multimodal benchmarks, indicating the potential for developing self-improving VLMs. Our value model and code are available at https://github.com/si0wang/VisVM.</description>

      <title>EmbodiedOcc: Embodied 3D Occupancy Prediction for Vision-based Online Scene Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction provides a comprehensive description of the surrounding scenes and has become an essential task for 3D perception. Most existing methods focus on offline perception from one or a few views and cannot be applied to embodied agents which demands to gradually perceive the scene through progressive embodied exploration. In this paper, we formulate an embodied 3D occupancy prediction task to target this practical scenario and propose a Gaussian-based EmbodiedOcc framework to accomplish it. We initialize the global scene with uniform 3D semantic Gaussians and progressively update local regions observed by the embodied agent. For each update, we extract semantic and structural features from the observed image and efficiently incorporate them via deformable cross-attention to refine the regional Gaussians. Finally, we employ Gaussian-to-voxel splatting to obtain the global 3D occupancy from the updated 3D Gaussians. Our EmbodiedOcc assumes an unknown (i.e., uniformly distributed) environment and maintains an explicit global memory of it with 3D Gaussians. It gradually gains knowledge through the local refinement of regional Gaussians, which is consistent with how humans understand new scenes through embodied exploration. We reorganize an EmbodiedOcc-ScanNet benchmark based on local annotations to facilitate the evaluation of the embodied 3D occupancy prediction task. Experiments demonstrate that our EmbodiedOcc outperforms existing local prediction methods and accomplishes the embodied occupancy prediction with high accuracy and strong expandability.

      <title>GaussianFormer-2: Probabilistic Gaussian Superposition for Efficient 3D Occupancy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is an important task for robust vision-centric autonomous driving, which predicts fine-grained geometry and semantics of the surrounding scene. Most existing methods leverage dense grid-based scene representations, overlooking the spatial sparsity of the driving scenes. Although 3D semantic Gaussian serves as an object-centric sparse alternative, most of the Gaussians still describe the empty region with low efficiency. To address this, we propose a probabilistic Gaussian superposition model which interprets each Gaussian as a probability distribution of its neighborhood being occupied and conforms to probabilistic multiplication to derive the overall geometry. Furthermore, we adopt the exact Gaussian mixture model for semantics calculation to avoid unnecessary overlapping of Gaussians. To effectively initialize Gaussians in non-empty region, we design a distribution-based initialization module which learns the pixel-aligned occupancy distribution instead of the depth of surfaces. We conduct extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI-360 datasets and our GaussianFormer-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.
