      <title>GRAFNet: Multiscale Retinal Processing via Guided Cortical Attention Feedback for Enhancing Medical Image Polyp Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate polyp segmentation in colonoscopy is essential for cancer prevention but remains challenging due to: (1) high morphological variability (from flat to protruding lesions), (2) strong visual similarity to normal structures such as folds and vessels, and (3) the need for robust multi-scale detection. Existing deep learning approaches suffer from unidirectional processing, weak multi-scale fusion, and the absence of anatomical constraints, often leading to false positives (over-segmentation of normal structures) and false negatives (missed subtle flat lesions). We propose GRAFNet, a biologically inspired architecture that emulates the hierarchical organisation of the human visual system. GRAFNet integrates three key modules: (1) a Guided Asymmetric Attention Module (GAAM) that mimics orientation-tuned cortical neurones to emphasise polyp boundaries, (2) a MultiScale Retinal Module (MSRM) that replicates retinal ganglion cell pathways for parallel multi-feature analysis, and (3) a Guided Cortical Attention Feedback Module (GCAFM) that applies predictive coding for iterative refinement. These are unified in a Polyp Encoder-Decoder Module (PEDM) that enforces spatial-semantic consistency via resolution-adaptive feedback. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks (Kvasir-SEG, CVC-300, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-Clinic, and PolypGen) demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance, with 3-8% Dice improvements and 10-20% higher generalisation over leading methods, while offering interpretable decision pathways. This work establishes a paradigm in which neural computation principles bridge the gap between AI accuracy and clinically trustworthy reasoning.

      <title>Zero-shot HOI Detection with MLLM-based Detector-agnostic Interaction Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot Human-object interaction (HOI) detection aims to locate humans and objects in images and recognize their interactions. While advances in open-vocabulary object detection provide promising solutions for object localization, interaction recognition (IR) remains challenging due to the combinatorial diversity of interactions. Existing methods, including two-stage methods, tightly couple IR with a specific detector and rely on coarse-grained vision-language model (VLM) features, which limit generalization to unseen interactions. In this work, we propose a decoupled framework that separates object detection from IR and leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for zero-shot IR. We introduce a deterministic generation method that formulates IR as a visual question answering task and enforces deterministic outputs, enabling training-free zero-shot IR. To further enhance performance and efficiency by fine-tuning the model, we design a spatial-aware pooling module that integrates appearance and pairwise spatial cues, and a one-pass deterministic matching method that predicts all candidate interactions in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO demonstrate that our method achieves superior zero-shot performance, strong cross-dataset generalization, and the flexibility to integrate with any object detectors without retraining. The codes are publicly available at https://github.com/SY-Xuan/DA-HOI.</description>

      <title>MB-DSMIL-CL-PL: Scalable Weakly Supervised Ovarian Cancer Subtype Classification and Localisation Using Contrastive and Prototype Learning with Frozen Patch Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of histopathological subtypes is valuable for the personalisation of effective treatment strategies for ovarian cancer. However, increasing diagnostic workloads present a challenge for UK pathology departments, leading to the rise in AI approaches. While traditional approaches in this field have relied on pre-computed, frozen image features, recent advances have shifted towards end-to-end feature extraction, providing an improvement in accuracy but at the expense of significantly reduced scalability during training and time-consuming experimentation. In this paper, we propose a new approach for subtype classification and localisation in ovarian cancer histopathology images using contrastive and prototype learning with pre-computed, frozen features via feature-space augmentations. Compared to DSMIL, our method achieves an improvement of 70.4\% and 15.3\% in F1 score for instance- and slide-level classification, respectively, along with AUC gains of 16.9\% for instance localisation and 2.3\% for slide classification, while maintaining the use of frozen patch features.</description>

      <title>Loss Knows Best: Detecting Annotation Errors in Videos via Loss Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality video datasets are foundational for training robust models in tasks like action recognition, phase detection, and event segmentation. However, many real-world video datasets suffer from annotation errors such as *mislabeling*, where segments are assigned incorrect class labels, and *disordering*, where the temporal sequence does not follow the correct progression. These errors are particularly harmful in phase-annotated tasks, where temporal consistency is critical. We propose a novel, model-agnostic method for detecting annotation errors by analyzing the Cumulative Sample Loss (CSL)--defined as the average loss a frame incurs when passing through model checkpoints saved across training epochs. This per-frame loss trajectory acts as a dynamic fingerprint of frame-level learnability. Mislabeled or disordered frames tend to show consistently high or irregular loss patterns, as they remain difficult for the model to learn throughout training, while correctly labeled frames typically converge to low loss early. To compute CSL, we train a video segmentation model and store its weights at each epoch. These checkpoints are then used to evaluate the loss of each frame in a test video. Frames with persistently high CSL are flagged as likely candidates for annotation errors, including mislabeling or temporal misalignment. Our method does not require ground truth on annotation errors and is generalizable across datasets. Experiments on EgoPER and Cholec80 demonstrate strong detection performance, effectively identifying subtle inconsistencies such as mislabeling and frame disordering. The proposed approach provides a powerful tool for dataset auditing and improving training reliability in video-based machine learning.</description>

      <title>Distributional Deep Learning for Super-Resolution of 4D Flow MRI under Domain Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-resolution is widely used in medical imaging to enhance low-quality data, reducing scan time and improving abnormality detection. Conventional super-resolution approaches typically rely on paired datasets of downsampled and original high resolution images, training models to reconstruct high resolution images from their artificially degraded counterparts. However, in real-world clinical settings, low resolution data often arise from acquisition mechanisms that differ significantly from simple downsampling. As a result, these inputs may lie outside the domain of the training data, leading to poor model generalization due to domain shift. To address this limitation, we propose a distributional deep learning framework that improves model robustness and domain generalization. We develop this approch for enhancing the resolution of 4D Flow MRI (4DF). This is a novel imaging modality that captures hemodynamic flow velocity and clinically relevant metrics such as vessel wall stress. These metrics are critical for assessing aneurysm rupture risk. Our model is initially trained on high resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and their downsampled counterparts. It is then fine-tuned on a small, harmonized dataset of paired 4D Flow MRI and CFD samples. We derive the theoretical properties of our distributional estimators and demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms traditional deep learning approaches through real data applications. This highlights the effectiveness of distributional learning in addressing domain shift and improving super-resolution performance in clinically realistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Time-Archival Camera Virtualization for Sports and Visual Performances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Camera virtualization -- an emerging solution to novel view synthesis -- holds transformative potential for visual entertainment, live performances, and sports broadcasting by enabling the generation of photorealistic images from novel viewpoints using images from a limited set of calibrated multiple static physical cameras. Despite recent advances, achieving spatially and temporally coherent and photorealistic rendering of dynamic scenes with efficient time-archival capabilities, particularly in fast-paced sports and stage performances, remains challenging for existing approaches. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for dynamic scenes could offer real-time view-synthesis results. Yet, they are hindered by their dependence on accurate 3D point clouds from the structure-from-motion method and their inability to handle large, non-rigid, rapid motions of different subjects (e.g., flips, jumps, articulations, sudden player-to-player transitions). Moreover, independent motions of multiple subjects can break the Gaussian-tracking assumptions commonly used in 4DGS, ST-GS, and other dynamic splatting variants. This paper advocates reconsidering a neural volume rendering formulation for camera virtualization and efficient time-archival capabilities, making it useful for sports broadcasting and related applications. By modeling a dynamic scene as rigid transformations across multiple synchronized camera views at a given time, our method performs neural representation learning, providing enhanced visual rendering quality at test time. A key contribution of our approach is its support for time-archival, i.e., users can revisit any past temporal instance of a dynamic scene and can perform novel view synthesis, enabling retrospective rendering for replay, analysis, and archival of live events, a functionality absent in existing neural rendering approaches and novel view synthesis...</description>

      <title>How to Train Your Long-Context Visual Document Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive, large-scale study of training long-context vision language models up to 344K context, targeting long-document visual question answering with measured transfer to long-context text. While several such strong are open-weight, namely Qwen3 VL and GLM 4.5/6V, their training recipes and data pipelines are not reproducible. We systematically study continued pretraining, supervised finetuning, and preference optimization for 24B and 32B parameter models, backed by extensive LC evaluations and ablations to bridge this gap, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBenchDoc for both parameter scales. In addition to this, our key findings include: (i) training on context lengths that match evaluation context lengths outperforms training on longer contexts, (ii) training and evaluating with page indices provides a simple, high-impact boost to long-document performance, (iii) our synthetic data pipelines enable self-improvement via continued pretraining and supervised finetuning, and (iv) we extend the known text-to-visual long context transfer to the reverse, showing that visual long context training transfers to long-context text performance. We also release MMLBD-C, a manually corrected version of MMLongBenchDoc to reduce erroneous and low quality examples in the benchmark.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Large-Scale Dataset Distillation via Exploration-Exploitation Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses the original data into compact synthetic datasets, reducing training time and storage while retaining model performance, enabling deployment under limited resources. Although recent decoupling-based distillation methods enable dataset distillation at large-scale, they continue to face an efficiency gap: optimization-based decoupling methods achieve higher accuracy but demand intensive computation, whereas optimization-free decoupling methods are efficient but sacrifice accuracy. To overcome this trade-off, we propose Exploration-Exploitation Distillation (E^2D), a simple, practical method that minimizes redundant computation through an efficient pipeline that begins with full-image initialization to preserve semantic integrity and feature diversity. It then uses a two-phase optimization strategy: an exploration phase that performs uniform updates and identifies high-loss regions, and an exploitation phase that focuses updates on these regions to accelerate convergence. We evaluate E^2D on large-scale benchmarks, surpassing the state-of-the-art on ImageNet-1K while being 18x faster, and on ImageNet-21K, our method substantially improves accuracy while remaining 4.3x faster. These results demonstrate that targeted, redundancy-reducing updates, rather than brute-force optimization, bridge the gap between accuracy and efficiency in large-scale dataset distillation.

      <title>Visual Persuasion: What Influences Decisions of Vision-Language Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The web is littered with images, once created for human consumption and now increasingly interpreted by agents using vision-language models (VLMs). These agents make visual decisions at scale, deciding what to click, recommend, or buy. Yet, we know little about the structure of their visual preferences. We introduce a framework for studying this by placing VLMs in controlled image-based choice tasks and systematically perturbing their inputs. Our key idea is to treat the agent's decision function as a latent visual utility that can be inferred through revealed preference: choices between systematically edited images. Starting from common images, such as product photos, we propose methods for visual prompt optimization, adapting text optimization methods to iteratively propose and apply visually plausible modifications using an image generation model (such as in composition, lighting, or background). We then evaluate which edits increase selection probability. Through large-scale experiments on frontier VLMs, we demonstrate that optimized edits significantly shift choice probabilities in head-to-head comparisons. We develop an automatic interpretability pipeline to explain these preferences, identifying consistent visual themes that drive selection. We argue that this approach offers a practical and efficient way to surface visual vulnerabilities, safety concerns that might otherwise be discovered implicitly in the wild, supporting more proactive auditing and governance of image-based AI agents.</description>

      <title>Consistency-Preserving Diverse Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-video generation is expensive, so only a few samples are typically produced per prompt. In this low-sample regime, maximizing the value of each batch requires high cross-video diversity. Recent methods improve diversity for image generation, but for videos they often degrade within-video temporal consistency and require costly backpropagation through a video decoder. We propose a joint-sampling framework for flow-matching video generators that improves batch diversity while preserving temporal consistency. Our approach applies diversity-driven updates and then removes only the components that would decrease a temporal-consistency objective. To avoid image-space gradients, we compute both objectives with lightweight latent-space models, avoiding video decoding and decoder backpropagation. Experiments on a state-of-the-art text-to-video flow-matching model show diversity comparable to strong joint-sampling baselines while substantially improving temporal consistency and color naturalness. Code will be released.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection in 3D Brain MRI with 2D Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) has gained increasing attention in medical imaging as a way to identify abnormalities without task-specific supervision, but most advances remain limited to 2D datasets. Extending ZSAD to 3D medical images has proven challenging, with existing methods relying on slice-wise features and vision-language models, which fail to capture volumetric structure. In this paper, we introduce a fully training-free framework for ZSAD in 3D brain MRI that constructs localized volumetric tokens by aggregating multi-axis slices processed by 2D foundation models. These 3D patch tokens restore cubic spatial context and integrate directly with distance-based, batch-level anomaly detection pipelines. The framework provides compact 3D representations that are practical to compute on standard GPUs and require no fine-tuning, prompts, or supervision. Our results show that training-free, batch-based ZSAD can be effectively extended from 2D encoders to full 3D MRI volumes, offering a simple and robust approach for volumetric anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Sparrow: Text-Anchored Window Attention with Visual-Semantic Glimpsing for Speculative Decoding in Video LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although speculative decoding is widely used to accelerate Vision-Language Models (VLMs) inference, it faces severe performance collapse when applied to Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs). The draft model typically falls into the trap of attention dilution and negative visual gain due to key-value cache explosion and context window mismatches. We observe a visual semantic internalization phenomenon in Vid-LLMs, indicating that critical visual semantics are implicitly encoded into text hidden states during deep-layer interactions, which renders raw visual inputs structurally redundant during deep inference. To address this, we propose the Sparrow framework, which first utilizes visually-aware text-anchored window attention via hidden state reuse to fully offload visual computation to the target model, and leverages intermediate-layer visual state bridging to train the draft model with semantic-rich intermediate states, thereby filtering out low-level visual noise. Additionally, a multi-token prediction strategy is introduced to bridge the training-inference distribution shift. Experiments show that Sparrow achieves an average speedup of 2.82x even with 25k visual tokens, effectively resolving the performance degradation in long sequences and offering a practical solution for real-time long video tasks.</description>

      <title>EventMemAgent: Hierarchical Event-Centric Memory for Online Video Understanding with Adaptive Tool Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online video understanding requires models to perform continuous perception and long-range reasoning within potentially infinite visual streams. Its fundamental challenge lies in the conflict between the unbounded nature of streaming media input and the limited context window of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current methods primarily rely on passive processing, which often face a trade-off between maintaining long-range context and capturing the fine-grained details necessary for complex tasks. To address this, we introduce EventMemAgent, an active online video agent framework based on a hierarchical memory module. Our framework employs a dual-layer strategy for online videos: short-term memory detects event boundaries and utilizes event-granular reservoir sampling to process streaming video frames within a fixed-length buffer dynamically; long-term memory structuredly archives past observations on an event-by-event basis. Furthermore, we integrate a multi-granular perception toolkit for active, iterative evidence capture and employ Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) to end-to-end internalize reasoning and tool-use strategies into the agent's intrinsic capabilities. Experiments show that EventMemAgent achieves competitive results on online video benchmarks. The code will be released here: https://github.com/lingcco/EventMemAgent.</description>

Abstract: Multimodal Fusion Learning (MFL), leveraging disparate data from various imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, CT, SPECT), has shown great potential for addressing medical problems such as skin cancer and brain tumor prediction. However, existing MFL methods face three key limitations: a) they often specialize in specific modalities, and overlook effective shared complementary information across diverse modalities, hence limiting their generalizability for multi-disease analysis; b) they rely on computationally expensive models, restricting their applicability in resource-limited settings; and c) they lack robustness against adversarial attacks, compromising reliability in medical AI applications. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multi-Attention Integration Learning (MAIL) network, incorporating two key components: a) an efficient residual learning attention block for capturing refined modality-specific multi-scale patterns and b) an efficient multimodal cross-attention module for learning enriched complementary shared representations across diverse modalities. Furthermore, to ensure adversarial robustness, we extend MAIL network to design Robust-MAIL by incorporating random projection filters and modulated attention noise. Extensive evaluations on 20 public datasets show that both MAIL and Robust-MAIL outperform existing methods, achieving performance gains of up to 9.34% while reducing computational costs by up to 78.3%. These results highlight the superiority of our approaches, ensuring more reliable predictions than top competitors. Code: https://github.com/misti1203/MAIL-Robust-MAIL.</description>

      <title>CREMD: Crowd-Sourced Emotional Multimodal Dogs Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dog emotion recognition plays a crucial role in enhancing human-animal interactions, veterinary care, and the development of automated systems for monitoring canine well-being. However, accurately interpreting dog emotions is challenging due to the subjective nature of emotional assessments and the absence of standardized ground truth methods. We present the CREMD (Crowd-sourced Emotional Multimodal Dogs Dataset), a comprehensive dataset exploring how different presentation modes (e.g., context, audio, video) and annotator characteristics (e.g., dog ownership, gender, professional experience) influence the perception and labeling of dog emotions. The dataset consists of 923 video clips presented in three distinct modes: without context or audio, with context but no audio, and with both context and audio. We analyze annotations from diverse participants, including dog owners, professionals, and individuals with varying demographic backgrounds and experience levels, to identify factors that influence reliable dog emotion recognition. Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) while adding visual context significantly improved annotation agreement, our findings regarding audio cues are inconclusive due to design limitations (specifically, the absence of a no-context-with-audio condition and limited clean audio availability); (2) contrary to expectations, non-owners and male annotators showed higher agreement levels than dog owners and female annotators, respectively, while professionals showed higher agreement levels, aligned with our initial hypothesis; and (3) the presence of audio substantially increased annotators' confidence in identifying specific emotions, particularly anger and fear.</description>

      <title>DAV-GSWT: Diffusion-Active-View Sampling for Data-Efficient Gaussian Splatting Wang Tiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has fundamentally redefined the capabilities of photorealistic neural rendering by enabling high-throughput synthesis of complex environments. While procedural methods like Wang Tiles have recently been integrated to facilitate the generation of expansive landscapes, these systems typically remain constrained by a reliance on densely sampled exemplar reconstructions. We present DAV-GSWT, a data-efficient framework that leverages diffusion priors and active view sampling to synthesize high-fidelity Gaussian Splatting Wang Tiles from minimal input observations. By integrating a hierarchical uncertainty quantification mechanism with generative diffusion models, our approach autonomously identifies the most informative viewpoints while hallucinating missing structural details to ensure seamless tile transitions. Experimental results indicate that our system significantly reduces the required data volume while maintaining the visual integrity and interactive performance necessary for large-scale virtual environments.</description>

      <title>GMAIL: Generative Modality Alignment for generated Image Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models have made it possible to synthesize highly realistic images, potentially providing an abundant data source for training machine learning models. Despite the advantages of these synthesizable data sources, the indiscriminate use of generated images as real images for training can even cause mode collapse due to modality discrepancies between real and synthetic domains. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for discriminative use of generated images, coined GMAIL, that explicitly treats generated images as a separate modality from real images. Instead of indiscriminately replacing real images with generated ones in the pixel space, our approach bridges the two distinct modalities in the same latent space through a multi-modal learning approach. To be specific, we first fine-tune a model exclusively on generated images using a cross-modality alignment loss and then employ this aligned model to further train various vision-language models with generated images. By aligning the two modalities, our approach effectively leverages the benefits of recent advances in generative models, thereby boosting the effectiveness of generated image learning across a range of vision-language tasks. Our framework can be easily incorporated with various vision-language models, and we demonstrate its efficacy throughout extensive experiments. For example, our framework significantly improves performance on image captioning, zero-shot image retrieval, zero-shot image classification, and long caption retrieval tasks. It also shows positive generated data scaling trends and notable enhancements in the captioning performance of the large multimodal model, LLaVA.</description>

      <title>Bridging Day and Night: Target-Class Hallucination Suppression in Unpaired Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Day-to-night unpaired image translation is important to downstream tasks but remains challenging due to large appearance shifts and the lack of direct pixel-level supervision. Existing methods often introduce semantic hallucinations, where objects from target classes such as traffic signs and vehicles, as well as man-made light effects, are incorrectly synthesized. These hallucinations significantly degrade downstream performance. We propose a novel framework that detects and suppresses hallucinations of target-class features during unpaired translation. To detect hallucination, we design a dual-head discriminator that additionally performs semantic segmentation to identify hallucinated content in background regions. To suppress these hallucinations, we introduce class-specific prototypes, constructed by aggregating features of annotated target-domain objects, which act as semantic anchors for each class. Built upon a Schrodinger Bridge-based translation model, our framework performs iterative refinement, where detected hallucination features are explicitly pushed away from class prototypes in feature space, thus preserving object semantics across the translation trajectory.Experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively. On the BDD100K dataset, it improves mAP by 15.5% for day-to-night domain adaptation, with a notable 31.7% gain for classes such as traffic lights that are prone to hallucinations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Generative Modeling beyond Memoryless Diffusion via Adjoint Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models often yield highly curved trajectories and noisy score targets due to an uninformative, memoryless forward process that induces independent data-noise coupling. We propose Adjoint Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (ASBM), a generative modeling framework that recovers optimal trajectories in high dimensions via two stages. First, we view the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) forward dynamic as a coupling construction problem and learn it through a data-to-energy sampling perspective that transports data to an energy-defined prior. Then, we learn the backward generative dynamic with a simple matching loss supervised by the induced optimal coupling. By operating in a non-memoryless regime, ASBM produces significantly straighter and more efficient sampling paths. Compared to prior works, ASBM scales to high-dimensional data with notably improved stability and efficiency. Extensive experiments on image generation show that ASBM improves fidelity with fewer sampling steps. We further showcase the effectiveness of our optimal trajectory via distillation to a one-step generator.</description>

      <title>Emergent Morphing Attack Detection in Open Multi-modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face morphing attacks threaten biometric verification, yet most morphing attack detection (MAD) systems require task-specific training and generalize poorly to unseen attack types. Meanwhile, open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong visual-linguistic reasoning, but their potential in biometric forensics remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of open-source MLLMs for single-image MAD, using publicly available weights and a standardized, reproducible protocol. Across diverse morphing techniques, many MLLMs show non-trivial discriminative ability without any fine-tuning or domain adaptation, and LLaVA1.6-Mistral-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing highly competitive task-specific MAD baselines by at least 23% in terms of equal error rate (EER). The results indicate that multimodal pretraining can implicitly encode fine-grained facial inconsistencies indicative of morphing artifacts, enabling zero-shot forensic sensitivity. Our findings position open-source MLLMs as reproducible, interpretable, and competitive foundations for biometric security and forensic image analysis. This emergent capability also highlights new opportunities to develop state-of-the-art MAD systems through targeted fine-tuning or lightweight adaptation, further improving accuracy and efficiency while preserving interpretability. To support future research, all code and evaluation protocols will be released upon publication.</description>

      <title>RPT-SR: Regional Prior attention Transformer for infrared image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General-purpose super-resolution models, particularly Vision Transformers, have achieved remarkable success but exhibit fundamental inefficiencies in common infrared imaging scenarios like surveillance and autonomous driving, which operate from fixed or nearly-static viewpoints. These models fail to exploit the strong, persistent spatial priors inherent in such scenes, leading to redundant learning and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose the Regional Prior attention Transformer for infrared image Super-Resolution (RPT-SR), a novel architecture that explicitly encodes scene layout information into the attention mechanism. Our core contribution is a dual-token framework that fuses (1) learnable, regional prior tokens, which act as a persistent memory for the scene's global structure, with (2) local tokens that capture the frame-specific content of the current input. By utilizing these tokens into an attention, our model allows the priors to dynamically modulate the local reconstruction process. Extensive experiments validate our approach. While most prior works focus on a single infrared band, we demonstrate the broad applicability and versatility of RPT-SR by establishing new state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets covering both Long-Wave (LWIR) and Short-Wave (SWIR) spectra</description>

      <title>LEADER: Lightweight End-to-End Attention-Gated Dual Autoencoder for Robust Minutiae Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minutiae extraction, a fundamental stage in fingerprint recognition, is increasingly shifting toward deep learning. However, truly end-to-end methods that eliminate separate preprocessing and postprocessing steps remain scarce. This paper introduces LEADER (Lightweight End-to-end Attention-gated Dual autoencodER), a neural network that maps raw fingerprint images to minutiae descriptors, including location, direction, and type. The proposed architecture integrates non-maximum suppression and angular decoding to enable complete end-to-end inference using only 0.9M parameters. It employs a novel "Castle-Moat-Rampart" ground-truth encoding and a dual-autoencoder structure, interconnected through an attention-gating mechanism. Experimental evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on plain fingerprints and robust cross-domain generalization to latent impressions. Specifically, LEADER attains a 34% higher F1-score on the NIST SD27 dataset compared to specialized latent minutiae extractors. Sample-level analysis on this challenging benchmark reveals an average rank of 2.07 among all compared methods, with LEADER securing the first-place position in 47% of the samples-more than doubling the frequency of the second-best extractor. The internal representations learned by the model align with established fingerprint domain features, such as segmentation masks, orientation fields, frequency maps, and skeletons. Inference requires 15ms on GPU and 322ms on CPU, outperforming leading commercial software in computational efficiency. The source code and pre-trained weights are publicly released to facilitate reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for Transient Object Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient objects in casual multi-view captures cause ghosting artifacts in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) reconstruction. Existing solutions relied on scene decomposition at significant memory cost or on motion-based heuristics that were vulnerable to parallax ambiguity. A semantic filtering framework was proposed for category-aware transient removal using vision-language models. CLIP similarity scores between rendered views and distractor text prompts were accumulated per-Gaussian across training iterations. Gaussians exceeding a calibrated threshold underwent opacity regularization and periodic pruning. Unlike motion-based approaches, semantic classification resolved parallax ambiguity by identifying object categories independently of motion patterns. Experiments on the RobustNeRF benchmark demonstrated consistent improvement in reconstruction quality over vanilla 3DGS across four sequences, while maintaining minimal memory overhead and real-time rendering performance. Threshold calibration and comparisons with baselines validated semantic guidance as a practical strategy for transient removal in scenarios with predictable distractor categories.</description>

      <title>Advanced Acceptance Score: A Holistic Measure for Biometric Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying biometric characteristics within hand gestures involve derivation of fitness scores from a gesture and identity aware feature space. However, evaluating the quality of these scores remains an open question. Existing biometric capacity estimation literature relies upon error rates. But these rates do not indicate goodness of scores. Thus, in this manuscript we present an exhaustive set of evaluation measures. We firstly identify ranking order and relevance of output scores as the primary basis for evaluation. In particular, we consider both rank deviation as well as rewards for: (i) higher scores of high ranked gestures and (ii) lower scores of low ranked gestures. We also compensate for correspondence between trends of output and ground truth scores. Finally, we account for disentanglement between identity features of gestures as a discounting factor. Integrating these elements with adequate weighting, we formulate advanced acceptance score as a holistic evaluation measure. To assess effectivity of the proposed we perform in-depth experimentation over three datasets with five state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Results show that the optimal score selected with our measure is more appropriate than existing other measures. Also, our proposed measure depicts correlation with existing measures. This further validates its reliability. We have made our \href{https://github.com/AmanVerma2307/MeasureSuite}{code} public.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Training-Free Fusion of Subject and Style LoRAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have explored the combination of multiple LoRAs to simultaneously generate user-specified subjects and styles. However, most existing approaches fuse LoRA weights using static statistical heuristics that deviate from LoRA's original purpose of learning adaptive feature adjustments and ignore the randomness of sampled inputs. To address this, we propose a dynamic training-free fusion framework that operates throughout the generation process. During the forward pass, at each LoRA-applied layer, we dynamically compute the KL divergence between the base model's original features and those produced by subject and style LoRAs, respectively, and adaptively select the most appropriate weights for fusion. In the reverse denoising stage, we further refine the generation trajectory by dynamically applying gradient-based corrections derived from objective metrics such as CLIP and DINO scores, providing continuous semantic and stylistic guidance. By integrating these two complementary mechanisms-feature-level selection and metric-guided latent adjustment-across the entire diffusion timeline, our method dynamically achieves coherent subject-style synthesis without any retraining. Extensive experiments across diverse subject-style combinations demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LoRA fusion methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Revealing and Enhancing Core Visual Regions: Harnessing Internal Attention Dynamics for Hallucination Mitigation in LVLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LVLMs have achieved strong multimodal reasoning capabilities but remain prone to hallucinations, producing outputs inconsistent with visual inputs or user instructions. Existing training-free methods, including contrastive decoding and auxiliary expert models, which incur several times more computational overhead and may introduce potential interference, as well as static internal signal enhancement, are often vulnerable to the attention sink phenomenon. We find that internal Positive Attention Dynamics (PAD) in LVLMs naturally reveal semantically core visual regions under the distortions of attention sinks. Based on this, we propose Positive Attention Dynamics Enhancement (PADE), a training-free attention intervention that constructs a PAD map to identify semantically core visual regions, applies per-head Median Absolute Deviation Scaling to adaptively control the intervention strength, and leverages System-Token Compensation to maintain attention to complex user instructions and support long-term output consistency. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that PADE improves visual grounding and reduces hallucinations, validating the effectiveness of leveraging internal attention dynamics for reliable multimodal reasoning.</description>

      <title>Intracoronary Optical Coherence Tomography Image Processing and Vessel Classification Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intracoronary Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution visualization of coronary vessel anatomy but presents challenges due to noise, imaging artifacts, and complex tissue structures. This paper proposes a fully automated pipeline for vessel segmentation and classification in OCT images using machine learning techniques. The proposed method integrates image preprocessing, guidewire artifact removal, polar-to-Cartesian transformation, unsupervised K-means clustering, and local feature extraction. These features are used to train Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine classifiers for pixel-wise vessel classification. Experimental results demonstrate excellent performance, achieving precision, recall, and F1-score values up to 1.00 and overall classification accuracy of 99.68%. The proposed approach provides accurate vessel boundary detection while maintaining low computational complexity and requiring minimal manual annotation. This method offers a reliable and efficient solution for automated OCT image analysis and has potential applications in clinical decision support and real-time medical image processing.</description>

      <title>An Industrial Dataset for Scene Acquisitions and Functional Schematics Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning functional schematics with 2D and 3D scene acquisitions is crucial for building digital twins, especially for old industrial facilities that lack native digital models. Current manual alignment using images and LiDAR data does not scale due to tediousness and complexity of industrial sites. Inconsistencies between schematics and reality, and the scarcity of public industrial datasets, make the problem both challenging and underexplored. This paper introduces IRIS-v2, a comprehensive dataset to support further research. It includes images, point clouds, 2D annotated boxes and segmentation masks, a CAD model, 3D pipe routing information, and the P&amp;ID (Piping and Instrumentation Diagram). The alignment is experimented on a practical case study, aiming at reducing the time required for this task by combining segmentation and graph matching.</description>

      <title>Concept-Enhanced Multimodal RAG: Towards Interpretable and Accurate Radiology Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) through Vision-Language Models (VLMs) promises to reduce documentation burden, improve reporting consistency, and accelerate clinical workflows. However, their clinical adoption remains limited by the lack of interpretability and the tendency to hallucinate findings misaligned with imaging evidence. Existing research typically treats interpretability and accuracy as separate objectives, with concept-based explainability techniques focusing primarily on transparency, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods targeting factual grounding through external retrieval. We present Concept-Enhanced Multimodal RAG (CEMRAG), a unified framework that decomposes visual representations into interpretable clinical concepts and integrates them with multimodal RAG. This approach exploits enriched contextual prompts for RRG, improving both interpretability and factual accuracy. Experiments on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray across multiple VLM architectures, training regimes, and retrieval configurations demonstrate consistent improvements over both conventional RAG and concept-only baselines on clinical accuracy metrics and standard NLP measures. These results challenge the assumed trade-off between interpretability and performance, showing that transparent visual concepts can enhance rather than compromise diagnostic accuracy in medical VLMs. Our modular design decomposes interpretability into visual transparency and structured language model conditioning, providing a principled pathway toward clinically trustworthy AI-assisted radiology.</description>

      <title>A Novel Public Dataset for Strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) Ripeness Detection and Comparative Evaluation of YOLO-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa), known worldwide for its economic value and nutritional richness, is a widely cultivated fruit. Determining the correct ripeness level during the harvest period is crucial for both preventing losses for producers and ensuring consumers receive a quality product. However, traditional methods, i.e., visual assessments alone, can be subjective and have a high margin of error. Therefore, computer-assisted systems are needed. However, the scarcity of comprehensive datasets accessible to everyone in the literature makes it difficult to compare studies in this field. In this study, a new and publicly available strawberry ripeness dataset, consisting of 566 images and 1,201 labeled objects, prepared under variable light and environmental conditions in two different greenhouses in Turkey, is presented to the literature. Comparative tests conducted on the data set using YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLO11-based models showed that the highest precision value was 90.94% in the YOLOv9c model, while the highest recall value was 83.74% in the YOLO11s model. In terms of the general performance criterion mAP@50, YOLOv8s was the best performing model with a success rate of 86.09%. The results show that small and medium-sized models work more balanced and efficiently on this type of dataset, while also establishing a fundamental reference point for smart agriculture applications.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization for Design Parameters of 3D Image Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based segmentation and classification are crucial to large-scale biomedical imaging, particularly for 3D data, where manual analysis is impractical. Although many methods exist, selecting suitable models and tuning parameters remains a major bottleneck in practice. Hence, we introduce the 3D data Analysis Optimization Pipeline, a method designed to facilitate the design and parameterization of segmentation and classification using two Bayesian Optimization stages. First, the pipeline selects a segmentation model and optimizes postprocessing parameters using a domain-adapted syntactic benchmark dataset. To ensure a concise evaluation of segmentation performance, we introduce a segmentation quality metric that serves as the objective function. Second, the pipeline optimizes design choices of a classifier, such as encoder and classifier head architectures, incorporation of prior knowledge, and pretraining strategies. To reduce manual annotation effort, this stage includes an assisted class-annotation workflow that extracts predicted instances from the segmentation results and sequentially presents them to the operator, eliminating the need for manual tracking. In four case studies, the 3D data Analysis Optimization Pipeline efficiently identifies effective model and parameter configurations for individual datasets.</description>

      <title>Criteria-first, semantics-later: reproducible structure discovery in image-based sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across the natural and life sciences, images have become a primary measurement modality, yet the dominant analytic paradigm remains semantics-first. Structure is recovered by predicting or enforcing domain-specific labels. This paradigm fails systematically under the conditions that make image-based science most valuable, including open-ended scientific discovery, cross-sensor and cross-site comparability, and long-term monitoring in which domain ontologies and associated label sets drift culturally, institutionally, and ecologically. A deductive inversion is proposed in the form of criteria-first and semantics-later. A unified framework for criteria-first structure discovery is introduced. It separates criterion-defined, semantics-free structure extraction from downstream semantic mapping into domain ontologies or vocabularies and provides a domain-general scaffold for reproducible analysis across image-based sciences. Reproducible science requires that the first analytic layer perform criterion-driven, semantics-free structure discovery, yielding stable partitions, structural fields, or hierarchies defined by explicit optimality criteria rather than local domain ontologies. Semantics is not discarded; it is relocated downstream as an explicit mapping from the discovered structural product to a domain ontology or vocabulary, enabling plural interpretations and explicit crosswalks without rewriting upstream extraction. Grounded in cybernetics, observation-as-distinction, and information theory's separation of information from meaning, the argument is supported by cross-domain evidence showing that criteria-first components recur whenever labels do not scale. Finally, consequences are outlined for validation beyond class accuracy and for treating structural products as FAIR, AI-ready digital objects for long-term monitoring and digital twins.</description>

      <title>ToaSt: Token Channel Selection and Structured Pruning for Efficient ViT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success across various vision tasks, yet their deployment is often hindered by prohibitive computational costs. While structured weight pruning and token compression have emerged as promising solutions, they suffer from prolonged retraining times and global propagation that creates optimization challenges, respectively. We propose ToaSt, a decoupled framework applying specialized strategies to distinct ViT components. We apply coupled head-wise structured pruning to Multi-Head Self-Attention modules, leveraging attention operation characteristics to enhance robustness. For Feed-Forward Networks (over 60\% of FLOPs), we introduce Token Channel Selection (TCS) that enhances compression ratios while avoiding global propagation issues. Our analysis reveals TCS effectively filters redundant noise during selection. Extensive evaluations across nine diverse models, including DeiT, ViT-MAE, and Swin Transformer, demonstrate that ToaSt achieves superior trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, consistently outperforming existing baselines. On ViT-MAE-Huge, ToaSt achieves 88.52\% accuracy (+1.64 \%) with 39.4\% FLOPs reduction. ToaSt transfers effectively to downstream tasks, cccccachieving 52.2 versus 51.9 mAP on COCO object detection. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Learning to Retrieve Navigable Candidates for Efficient Vision-and-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to follow natural-language instructions and navigate through previously unseen environments. Recent approaches increasingly employ large language models (LLMs) as high-level navigators due to their flexibility and reasoning capability. However, prompt-based LLM navigation often suffers from inefficient decision-making, as the model must repeatedly interpret instructions from scratch and reason over noisy and verbose navigable candidates at each step. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented framework to improve the efficiency and stability of LLM-based VLN without modifying or fine-tuning the underlying language model. Our approach introduces retrieval at two complementary levels. At the episode level, an instruction-level embedding retriever selects semantically similar successful navigation trajectories as in-context exemplars, providing task-specific priors for instruction grounding. At the step level, an imitation-learned candidate retriever prunes irrelevant navigable directions before LLM inference, reducing action ambiguity and prompt complexity. Both retrieval modules are lightweight, modular, and trained independently of the LLM. We evaluate our method on the Room-to-Room (R2R) benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in Success Rate, Oracle Success Rate, and SPL on both seen and unseen environments. Ablation studies further show that instruction-level exemplar retrieval and candidate pruning contribute complementary benefits to global guidance and step-wise decision efficiency. These results indicate that retrieval-augmented decision support is an effective and scalable strategy for enhancing LLM-based vision-and-language navigation.</description>

      <title>Spanning the Visual Analogy Space with a Weight Basis of LoRAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual analogy learning enables image manipulation through demonstration rather than textual description, allowing users to specify complex transformations difficult to articulate in words. Given a triplet $\{\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{a}'$, $\mathbf{b}\}$, the goal is to generate $\mathbf{b}'$ such that $\mathbf{a} : \mathbf{a}' :: \mathbf{b} : \mathbf{b}'$. Recent methods adapt text-to-image models to this task using a single Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module, but they face a fundamental limitation: attempting to capture the diverse space of visual transformations within a fixed adaptation module constrains generalization capabilities. Inspired by recent work showing that LoRAs in constrained domains span meaningful, interpolatable semantic spaces, we propose LoRWeB, a novel approach that specializes the model for each analogy task at inference time through dynamic composition of learned transformation primitives, informally, choosing a point in a "space of LoRAs". We introduce two key components: (1) a learnable basis of LoRA modules, to span the space of different visual transformations, and (2) a lightweight encoder that dynamically selects and weighs these basis LoRAs based on the input analogy pair. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly improves generalization to unseen visual transformations. Our findings suggest that LoRA basis decompositions are a promising direction for flexible visual manipulation. Code and data are in https://research.nvidia.com/labs/par/lorweb</description>

      <title>Language and Geometry Grounded Sparse Voxel Representations for Holistic Scene Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing 3D open-vocabulary scene understanding methods mostly emphasize distilling language features from 2D foundation models into 3D feature fields, but largely overlook the synergy among scene appearance, semantics, and geometry. As a result, scene understanding often deviates from the underlying geometric structure of scenes and becomes decoupled from the reconstruction process. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages language and geometry grounded sparse voxel representations to comprehensively model appearance, semantics, and geometry within a unified framework. Specifically, we use 3D sparse voxels as primitives and employ an appearance field, a density field, a feature field, and a confidence field to holistically represent a 3D scene. To promote synergy among the appearance, density, and feature fields, we construct a feature modulation module and distill language features from a 2D foundation model into our 3D scene model. In addition, we integrate geometric distillation into feature field distillation to transfer geometric knowledge from a geometry foundation model to our 3D scene representations via depth correlation regularization and pattern consistency regularization. These components work together to synergistically model the appearance, semantics, and geometry of the 3D scene within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior overall performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in holistic scene understanding and reconstruction.</description>

      <title>RaCo: Ranking and Covariance for Practical Learned Keypoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces RaCo, a lightweight neural network designed to learn robust and versatile keypoints suitable for a variety of 3D computer vision tasks. The model integrates three key components: the repeatable keypoint detector, a differentiable ranker to maximize matches with a limited number of keypoints, and a covariance estimator to quantify spatial uncertainty in metric scale. Trained on perspective image crops only, RaCo operates without the need for covisible image pairs. It achieves strong rotational robustness through extensive data augmentation, even without the use of computationally expensive equivariant network architectures. The method is evaluated on several challenging datasets, where it demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in keypoint repeatability and two-view matching, particularly under large in-plane rotations. Ultimately, RaCo provides an effective and simple strategy to independently estimate keypoint ranking and metric covariance without additional labels, detecting interpretable and repeatable interest points. The code is available at https://github.com/cvg/RaCo.</description>

      <title>Understanding vs. Generation: Navigating Optimization Dilemma in Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current research in multimodal models faces a key challenge where enhancing generative capabilities often comes at the expense of understanding, and vice versa. We analyzed this trade-off and identify the primary cause might be the potential conflict between generation and understanding, which creates a competitive dynamic within the model. To address this, we propose the Reason-Reflect-Refine (R3) framework. This innovative algorithm re-frames the single-step generation task into a multi-step process of "generate-understand-regenerate". By explicitly leveraging the model's understanding capability during generation, we successfully mitigate the optimization dilemma, achieved stronger generation results and improved understanding ability which are related to the generation process. This offers valuable insights for designing next-generation unified multimodal models. Code is available at https://github.com/sen-ye/R3.</description>

      <title>NeRFscopy: Neural Radiance Fields for in-vivo Time-Varying Tissues from Endoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Endoscopy is essential in medical imaging, used for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Developing a robust dynamic 3D reconstruction pipeline for endoscopic videos could enhance visualization, improve diagnostic accuracy, aid in treatment planning, and guide surgery procedures. However, challenges arise due to the deformable nature of the tissues, the use of monocular cameras, illumination changes, occlusions and unknown camera trajectories. Inspired by neural rendering, we introduce NeRFscopy, a self-supervised pipeline for novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction of deformable endoscopic tissues from a monocular video. NeRFscopy includes a deformable model with a canonical radiance field and a time-dependent deformation field parameterized by SE(3) transformations. In addition, the color images are efficiently exploited by introducing sophisticated terms to learn a 3D implicit model without assuming any template or pre-trained model, solely from data. NeRFscopy achieves accurate results in terms of novel view synthesis, outperforming competing methods across various challenging endoscopy scenes.</description>

      <title>Meteorological data and Sky Images meets Neural Models for Photovoltaic Power Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the rise in the use of renewable energies as an alternative to traditional ones, and especially solar energy, there is increasing interest in studying how to address photovoltaic forecasting in the face of the challenge of variability in photovoltaic energy production, using different methodologies. This work develops a hybrid approach for short and long-term forecasting based on two studies with the same purpose. A multimodal approach that combines images of the sky and photovoltaic energy history with meteorological data is proposed. The main goal is to improve the accuracy of ramp event prediction, increase the robustness of forecasts in cloudy conditions, and extend capabilities beyond nowcasting, to support more efficient operation of the power grid and better management of solar variability. Deep neural models are used for both nowcasting and forecasting solutions, incorporating individual and multiple meteorological variables, as well as an analytical solar position. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of meteorological data, particularly the surface long-wave, radiation downwards, and the combination of wind and solar position, significantly improves current predictions in both nowcasting and forecasting tasks, especially on cloudy days. This study highlights the importance of integrating diverse data sources to improve the reliability and interpretability of solar energy prediction models.</description>

      <title>Context-aware Skin Cancer Epithelial Cell Classification with Scalable Graph Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) from cancer patients contain rich information that can be used for medical diagnosis or to follow treatment progress. To automate their analysis, numerous deep learning methods based on convolutional neural networks and Vision Transformers have been developed and have achieved strong performance in segmentation and classification tasks. However, due to the large size and complex cellular organization of WSIs, these models rely on patch-based representations, losing vital tissue-level context. We propose using scalable Graph Transformers on a full-WSI cell graph for classification. We evaluate this methodology on a challenging task: the classification of healthy versus tumor epithelial cells in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), where both cell types exhibit very similar morphologies and are therefore difficult to differentiate for image-based approaches. We first compared image-based and graph-based methods on a single WSI. Graph Transformer models SGFormer and DIFFormer achieved balanced accuracies of $85.2 \pm 1.5$ ($\pm$ standard error) and $85.1 \pm 2.5$ in 3-fold cross-validation, respectively, whereas the best image-based method reached $81.2 \pm 3.0$. By evaluating several node feature configurations, we found that the most informative representation combined morphological and texture features as well as the cell classes of non-epithelial cells, highlighting the importance of the surrounding cellular context. We then extended our work to train on several WSIs from several patients. To address the computational constraints of image-based models, we extracted four $2560 \times 2560$ pixel patches from each image and converted them into graphs. In this setting, DIFFormer achieved a balanced accuracy of $83.6 \pm 1.9$ (3-fold cross-validation), while the state-of-the-art image-based model CellViT256 reached $78.1 \pm 0.5$.</description>

      <title>Task-Agnostic Continual Learning for Chest Radiograph Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical deployment of chest radiograph classifiers requires models that can be updated as new datasets become available without retraining on previously ob- served data or degrading validated performance. We study, for the first time, a task-incremental continual learning setting for chest radiograph classification, in which heterogeneous chest X-ray datasets arrive sequentially and task identifiers are unavailable at inference. We propose a continual adapter-based routing learning strategy for Chest X-rays (CARL-XRay) that maintains a fixed high-capacity backbone and incrementally allocates lightweight task-specific adapters and classifier heads. A latent task selector operates on task-adapted features and leverages both current and historical context preserved through compact prototypes and feature-level experience replay. This design supports stable task identification and adaptation across sequential updates while avoiding raw-image storage. Experiments on large-scale public chest radiograph datasets demonstrate robust performance retention and reliable task-aware inference under continual dataset ingestion. CARL-XRay outperforms joint training under task-unknown deployment, achieving higher routing accuracy (75.0\% vs.\ 62.5\%), while maintaining competitive diagnostic performance with AUROC of 0.74 in the oracle setting with ground-truth task identity and 0.75 under task-unknown inference, using significantly fewer trainable parameters. Finally, the proposed framework provides a practical alternative to joint training and repeated full retraining in continual clinical deployment.</description>

      <title>VideoSketcher: Video Models Prior Enable Versatile Sequential Sketch Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sketching is inherently a sequential process, in which strokes are drawn in a meaningful order to explore and refine ideas. However, most generative models treat sketches as static images, overlooking the temporal structure that underlies creative drawing. We present a data-efficient approach for sequential sketch generation that adapts pretrained text-to-video diffusion models to generate sketching processes. Our key insight is that large language models and video diffusion models offer complementary strengths for this task: LLMs provide semantic planning and stroke ordering, while video diffusion models serve as strong renderers that produce high-quality, temporally coherent visuals. We leverage this by representing sketches as short videos in which strokes are progressively drawn on a blank canvas, guided by text-specified ordering instructions. We introduce a two-stage fine-tuning strategy that decouples the learning of stroke ordering from the learning of sketch appearance. Stroke ordering is learned using synthetic shape compositions with controlled temporal structure, while visual appearance is distilled from as few as seven manually authored sketching processes that capture both global drawing order and the continuous formation of individual strokes. Despite the extremely limited amount of human-drawn sketch data, our method generates high-quality sequential sketches that closely follow text-specified orderings while exhibiting rich visual detail. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach through extensions such as brush style conditioning and autoregressive sketch generation, enabling additional controllability and interactive, collaborative drawing.</description>

      <title>StrokeNeXt: A Siamese-encoder Approach for Brain Stroke Classification in Computed Tomography Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present StrokeNeXt, a model for stroke classification in 2D Computed Tomography (CT) images. StrokeNeXt employs a dual-branch design with two ConvNeXt encoders, whose features are fused through a lightweight convolutional decoder based on stacked 1D operations, including a bottleneck projection and transformation layers, and a compact classification head. The model is evaluated on a curated dataset of 6,774 CT images, addressing both stroke detection and subtype classification between ischemic and hemorrhage cases. StrokeNeXt consistently outperforms convolutional and Transformer-based baselines, reaching accuracies and F1-scores of up to 0.988. Paired statistical tests confirm that the performance gains are statistically significant, while class-wise sensitivity and specificity demonstrate robust behavior across diagnostic categories. Calibration analysis shows reduced prediction error compared to competing methods, and confusion matrix results indicate low misclassification rates. In addition, the model exhibits low inference time and fast convergence.</description>

      <title>CGRA-DeBERTa Concept Guided Residual Augmentation Transformer for Theologically Islamic Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate QA over classical Islamic texts remains challenging due to domain specific semantics, long context dependencies, and concept sensitive reasoning. Therefore, a new CGRA DeBERTa, a concept guided residual domain augmentation transformer framework, is proposed that enhances theological QA over Hadith corpora. The CGRA DeBERTa builds on a customized DeBERTa transformer backbone with lightweight LoRA based adaptations and a residual concept aware gating mechanism. The customized DeBERTa embedding block learns global and positional context, while Concept Guided Residual Blocks incorporate theological priors from a curated Islamic Concept Dictionary of 12 core terms. Moreover, the Concept Gating Mechanism selectively amplifies semantically critical tokens via importance weighted attention, applying differential scaling from 1.04 to 3.00. This design preserves contextual integrity, strengthens domain-specific semantic representations, and enables accurate, efficient span extraction while maintaining computational efficiency. This paper reports the results of training CGRA using a specially constructed dataset of 42591 QA pairs from the text of Sahih alBukhari and Sahih Muslim. While BERT achieved an EM score of 75.87 and DeBERTa one of 89.77, our model scored 97.85 and thus surpassed them by 8.08 on an absolute scale, all while adding approximately 8 inference overhead due to parameter efficient gating. The qualitative evaluation noted better extraction and discrimination and theological precision. This study presents Hadith QA systems that are efficient, interpretable, and accurate and that scale provide educational materials with necessary theological nuance.</description>

      <title>Refine Now, Query Fast: A Decoupled Refinement Paradigm for Implicit Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as promising surrogates for large 3D scientific simulations due to their ability to continuously model spatial and conditional fields, yet they face a critical fidelity-speed dilemma: deep MLPs suffer from high inference cost, while efficient embedding-based models lack sufficient expressiveness. To resolve this, we propose the Decoupled Representation Refinement (DRR) architectural paradigm. DRR leverages a deep refiner network, alongside non-parametric transformations, in a one-time offline process to encode rich representations into a compact and efficient embedding structure. This approach decouples slow neural networks with high representational capacity from the fast inference path. We introduce DRR-Net, a simple network that validates this paradigm, and a novel data augmentation strategy, Variational Pairs (VP) for improving INRs under complex tasks like high-dimensional surrogate modeling. Experiments on several ensemble simulation datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art fidelity, while being up to 27$\times$ faster at inference than high-fidelity baselines and remaining competitive with the fastest models. The DRR paradigm offers an effective strategy for building powerful and practical neural field surrogates and \rev{INRs in broader applications}, with a minimal compromise between speed and quality.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Self-Supervised Models for Cardiac Ultrasound View Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable interpretation of cardiac ultrasound images is essential for accurate clinical diagnosis and assessment. Self-supervised learning has shown promise in medical imaging by leveraging large unlabelled datasets to learn meaningful representations. In this study, we evaluate and compare two self-supervised learning frameworks, USF-MAE, developed by our team, and MoCo v3, on the recently introduced CACTUS dataset (37,736 images) for automated simulated cardiac view (A4C, PL, PSAV, PSMV, Random, and SC) classification. Both models used 5-fold cross-validation, enabling robust assessment of generalization performance across multiple random splits. The CACTUS dataset provides expert-annotated cardiac ultrasound images with diverse views. We adopt an identical training protocol for both models to ensure a fair comparison. Both models are configured with a learning rate of 0.0001 and a weight decay of 0.01. For each fold, we record performance metrics including ROC-AUC, accuracy, F1-score, and recall. Our results indicate that USF-MAE consistently outperforms MoCo v3 across metrics. The average testing AUC for USF-MAE is 99.99% (+/-0.01% 95% CI), compared to 99.97% (+/-0.01%) for MoCo v3. USF-MAE achieves a mean testing accuracy of 99.33% (+/-0.18%), higher than the 98.99% (+/-0.28%) reported for MoCo v3. Similar trends are observed for the F1-score and recall, with improvements statistically significant across folds (paired t-test, p=0.0048 &lt; 0.01). This proof-of-concept analysis suggests that USF-MAE learns more discriminative features for cardiac view classification than MoCo v3 when applied to this dataset. The enhanced performance across multiple metrics highlights the potential of USF-MAE for improving automated cardiac ultrasound classification.</description>

      <title>Automatic Funny Scene Extraction from Long-form Cinematic Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatically extracting engaging and high-quality humorous scenes from cinematic titles is pivotal for creating captivating video previews and snackable content, boosting user engagement on streaming platforms. Long-form cinematic titles, with their extended duration and complex narratives, challenge scene localization, while humor's reliance on diverse modalities and its nuanced style add further complexity. This paper introduces an end-to-end system for automatically identifying and ranking humorous scenes from long-form cinematic titles, featuring shot detection, multimodal scene localization, and humor tagging optimized for cinematic content. Key innovations include a novel scene segmentation approach combining visual and textual cues, improved shot representations via guided triplet mining, and a multimodal humor tagging framework leveraging both audio and text. Our system achieves an 18.3% AP improvement over state-of-the-art scene detection on the OVSD dataset and an F1 score of 0.834 for detecting humor in long text. Extensive evaluations across five cinematic titles demonstrate 87% of clips extracted by our pipeline are intended to be funny, while 98% of scenes are accurately localized. With successful generalization to trailers, these results showcase the pipeline's potential to enhance content creation workflows, improve user engagement, and streamline snackable content generation for diverse cinematic media formats.</description>

      <title>The Vision Wormhole: Latent-Space Communication in Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models have unlocked advanced collaborative reasoning, yet they remain shackled by the inefficiency of discrete text communication, which imposes significant runtime overhead and information quantization loss. While latent state transfer offers a high-bandwidth alternative, existing approaches either assume homogeneous sender-receiver architectures or rely on pair-specific learned translators, limiting scalability and modularity across diverse model families with disjoint manifolds. In this work, we propose the Vision Wormhole, a novel framework that repurposes the visual interface of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable model-agnostic, text-free communication. By introducing a Universal Visual Codec, we map heterogeneous reasoning traces into a shared continuous latent space and inject them directly into the receiver's visual pathway, effectively treating the vision encoder as a universal port for inter-agent telepathy. Our framework adopts a hub-and-spoke topology to reduce pairwise alignment complexity from O(N^2) to O(N) and leverages a label-free, teacher-student distillation objective to align the high-speed visual channel with the robust reasoning patterns of the text pathway. Extensive experiments across heterogeneous model families (e.g., Qwen-VL, Gemma) demonstrate that the Vision Wormhole reduces end-to-end wall-clock time in controlled comparisons while maintaining reasoning fidelity comparable to standard text-based MAS.

      <title>Doubly Stochastic Mean-Shift Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard Mean-Shift algorithms are notoriously sensitive to the bandwidth hyperparameter, particularly in data-scarce regimes where fixed-scale density estimation leads to fragmentation and spurious modes. In this paper, we propose Doubly Stochastic Mean-Shift (DSMS), a novel extension that introduces randomness not only in the trajectory updates but also in the kernel bandwidth itself. By drawing both the data samples and the radius from a continuous uniform distribution at each iteration, DSMS effectively performs a better exploration of the density landscape. We show that this randomized bandwidth policy acts as an implicit regularization mechanism, and provide convergence theoretical results. Comparative experiments on synthetic Gaussian mixtures reveal that DSMS significantly outperforms standard and stochastic Mean-Shift baselines, exhibiting remarkable stability and preventing over-segmentation in sparse clustering scenarios without other performance degradation.</description>

      <title>On the Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Reasoning in Multimodal LLMs for Simple Visual Planning Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating reasoning in large language models and large vision-language models has recently led to significant improvement of their capabilities. However, the generalization of reasoning models is still vaguely defined and poorly understood. In this work, we present an evaluation framework to rigorously examine how well chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches generalize on a simple planning task. Specifically, we consider a grid-based navigation task in which a model is provided with a map and must output a sequence of moves that guides a player from a start position to a goal while avoiding obstacles. The versatility of the task and its data allows us to fine-tune model variants using different input representations (visual and textual) and CoT reasoning strategies, and systematically evaluate them under both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) test conditions. Our experiments show that, while CoT reasoning improves in-distribution generalization across all representations, out-of-distribution generalization (e.g., to larger maps) remains very limited in most cases when controlling for trivial matches with the ID data. Surprisingly, we find that reasoning traces which combine multiple text formats yield the best (and non-trivial) OOD generalization. Finally, purely text-based models consistently outperform those utilizing image-based inputs, including a recently proposed approach relying on latent space reasoning.</description>

      <title>CARE Drive A Framework for Evaluating Reason-Responsiveness of Vision Language Models in Automated Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models, including vision language models, are increasingly used in automated driving to interpret scenes, recommend actions, and generate natural language explanations. However, existing evaluation methods primarily assess outcome based performance, such as safety and trajectory accuracy, without determining whether model decisions reflect human relevant considerations. As a result, it remains unclear whether explanations produced by such models correspond to genuine reason responsive decision making or merely post hoc rationalizations. This limitation is especially significant in safety critical domains because it can create false confidence. To address this gap, we propose CARE Drive, Context Aware Reasons Evaluation for Driving, a model agnostic framework for evaluating reason responsiveness in vision language models applied to automated driving. CARE Drive compares baseline and reason augmented model decisions under controlled contextual variation to assess whether human reasons causally influence decision behavior. The framework employs a two stage evaluation process. Prompt calibration ensures stable outputs. Systematic contextual perturbation then measures decision sensitivity to human reasons such as safety margins, social pressure, and efficiency constraints. We demonstrate CARE Drive in a cyclist overtaking scenario involving competing normative considerations. Results show that explicit human reasons significantly influence model decisions, improving alignment with expert recommended behavior. However, responsiveness varies across contextual factors, indicating uneven sensitivity to different types of reasons. These findings provide empirical evidence that reason responsiveness in foundation models can be systematically evaluated without modifying model parameters.</description>

      <title>Guided Diffusion by Optimized Loss Functions on Relaxed Parameters for Inverse Material Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse design problems are common in engineering and materials science. The forward direction, i.e., computing output quantities from design parameters, typically requires running a numerical simulation, such as a FEM, as an intermediate step, which is an optimization problem by itself. In many scenarios, several design parameters can lead to the same or similar output values. For such cases, multi-modal probabilistic approaches are advantageous to obtain diverse solutions. A major difficulty in inverse design stems from the structure of the design space, since discrete parameters or further constraints disallow the direct use of gradient-based optimization. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel inverse design method based on diffusion models. Our approach relaxes the original design space into a continuous grid representation, where gradients can be computed by implicit differentiation in the forward simulation. A diffusion model is trained on this relaxed parameter space in order to serve as a prior for plausible relaxed designs. Parameters are sampled by guided diffusion using gradients that are propagated from an objective function specified at inference time through the differentiable simulation. A design sample is obtained by backprojection into the original parameter space. We develop our approach for a composite material design problem where the forward process is modeled as a linear FEM problem. We evaluate the performance of our approach in finding designs that match a specified bulk modulus. We demonstrate that our method can propose diverse designs within 1% relative error margin from medium to high target bulk moduli in 2D and 3D settings. We also demonstrate that the material density of generated samples can be minimized simultaneously by using a multi-objective loss function.</description>

Abstract: This work considers merging two independent models, TTS and A2F, into a unified model to enable internal feature transfer, thereby improving the consistency between audio and facial expressions generated from text. We also discuss the extension of the emotion control mechanism from TTS to the joint model. This work does not aim to showcase generation quality; instead, from a system design perspective, it validates the feasibility of reusing intermediate representations from TTS for joint modeling of speech and facial expressions, and provides engineering practice references for subsequent speech expression co-design.

      <title>Dex4D: Task-Agnostic Point Track Policy for Sim-to-Real Dexterous Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning generalist policies capable of accomplishing a plethora of everyday tasks remains an open challenge in dexterous manipulation. In particular, collecting large-scale manipulation data via real-world teleoperation is expensive and difficult to scale. While learning in simulation provides a feasible alternative, designing multiple task-specific environments and rewards for training is similarly challenging. We propose Dex4D, a framework that instead leverages simulation for learning task-agnostic dexterous skills that can be flexibly recomposed to perform diverse real-world manipulation tasks. Specifically, Dex4D learns a domain-agnostic 3D point track conditioned policy capable of manipulating any object to any desired pose. We train this 'Anypose-to-Anypose' policy in simulation across thousands of objects with diverse pose configurations, covering a broad space of robot-object interactions that can be composed at test time. At deployment, this policy can be zero-shot transferred to real-world tasks without finetuning, simply by prompting it with desired object-centric point tracks extracted from generated videos. During execution, Dex4D uses online point tracking for closed-loop perception and control. Extensive experiments in simulation and on real robots show that our method enables zero-shot deployment for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks and yields consistent improvements over prior baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong generalization to novel objects, scene layouts, backgrounds, and trajectories, highlighting the robustness and scalability of the proposed framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present GS-ProCams, the first Gaussian Splatting-based framework for projector-camera systems (ProCams). GS-ProCams is not only view-agnostic but also significantly enhances the efficiency of projection mapping (PM) that requires establishing geometric and radiometric mappings between the projector and the camera. Previous CNN-based ProCams are constrained to a specific viewpoint, limiting their applicability to novel perspectives. In contrast, NeRF-based ProCams support view-agnostic projection mapping, however, they require an additional co-located light source and demand significant computational and memory resources. To address this issue, we propose GS-ProCams that employs 2D Gaussian for scene representations, and enables efficient view-agnostic ProCams applications. In particular, we explicitly model the complex geometric and photometric mappings of ProCams using projector responses, the projection surface's geometry and materials represented by Gaussians, and the global illumination component. Then, we employ differentiable physically-based rendering to jointly estimate them from captured multi-view projections. Compared to state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods, our GS-ProCams eliminates the need for additional devices, achieving superior ProCams simulation quality. It also uses only 1/10 of the GPU memory for training and is 900 times faster in inference speed.

      <title>DARB-Splatting: Generalizing Splatting with Decaying Anisotropic Radial Basis Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Splatting-based 3D reconstruction methods have gained popularity with the advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting, efficiently synthesizing high-quality novel views. These methods commonly resort to using exponential family functions, such as the Gaussian function, as reconstruction kernels due to their anisotropic nature, ease of projection, and differentiability in rasterization. However, the field remains restricted to variations within the exponential family, leaving generalized reconstruction kernels largely underexplored, partly due to the lack of easy integrability in 3D to 2D projections. In this light, we show that a class of decaying anisotropic radial basis functions (DARBFs), which are non-negative functions of the Mahalanobis distance, supports splatting by approximating the Gaussian function's closed-form integration advantage. With this fresh perspective, we demonstrate varying performances across selected DARB reconstruction kernels, achieving comparable training convergence and memory footprints, with on-par PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents SSL4EO-S12 v1.1, a multimodal, multitemporal Earth Observation dataset designed for pretraining large-scale foundation models. Building on the success of SSL4EO-S12, this extension updates the previous version to fix geospatial alignment inaccuracies and the inefficent data structure. The dataset allows low-barrier, analysis-ready data loading while maintaining the predecessor's spatial coverage of the world's 10,000 largest cities and surrounding geographies, resulting in 246k time series with nearly one million image patches. We package each time series in Zarr file format stored in WebDataset tar shards for efficient data loading and representation of meta-information such as cloud masks. We add new modalities for elevation, land-cover, and vegetation to support multimodal pre-training. Released under the CC-BY-4.0 license, SSL4EO-S12 v1.1 facilitates open research and provides a robust foundation for future advancements in self-supervised learning and geospatial analysis. The dataset is available online through https://huggingface.co/datasets/embed2scale/SSL4EO-S12-v1.1.</description>

      <title>VITAL: More Understandable Feature Visualization through Distribution Alignment and Relevant Information Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks are widely adopted to solve complex and challenging tasks. Especially in high-stakes decision-making, understanding their reasoning process is crucial, yet proves challenging for modern deep networks. Feature visualization (FV) is a powerful tool to decode what information neurons are responding to and hence to better understand the reasoning behind such networks. In particular, in FV we generate human-understandable images that reflect the information detected by neurons of interest. However, current methods often yield unrecognizable visualizations, exhibiting repetitive patterns and visual artifacts that are hard to understand for a human. To address these problems, we propose to guide FV through statistics of real image features combined with measures of relevant network flow to generate prototypical images. Our approach yields human-understandable visualizations that both qualitatively and quantitatively improve over state-of-the-art FVs across various architectures. As such, it can be used to decode which information the network uses, complementing mechanistic circuits that identify where it is encoded.

      <title>Multispectral airborne laser scanning for tree species classification: a benchmark of machine learning and deep learning algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Climate-smart and biodiversity-preserving forestry demands precise information on forest resources, extending to the individual tree level. Multispectral airborne laser scanning (ALS) has shown promise in automated point cloud processing, but challenges remain in leveraging deep learning techniques and identifying rare tree species in class-imbalanced datasets. This study addresses these gaps by conducting a comprehensive benchmark of deep learning and traditional shallow machine learning methods for tree species classification. For the study, we collected high-density multispectral ALS data ($&gt;1000$ $\mathrm{pts}/\mathrm{m}^2$) at three wavelengths using the FGI-developed HeliALS system, complemented by existing Optech Titan data (35 $\mathrm{pts}/\mathrm{m}^2$), to evaluate the species classification accuracy of various algorithms in a peri-urban study area located in southern Finland. We established a field reference dataset of 6326 segments across nine species using a newly developed browser-based crowdsourcing tool, which facilitated efficient data annotation. The ALS data, including a training dataset of 1065 segments, was shared with the scientific community to foster collaborative research and diverse algorithmic contributions. Based on 5261 test segments, our findings demonstrate that point-based deep learning methods, particularly a point transformer model, outperformed traditional machine learning and image-based deep learning approaches on high-density multispectral point clouds. For the high-density ALS dataset, a point transformer model provided the best performance reaching an overall (macro-average) accuracy of 87.9% (74.5%) with a training set of 1065 segments and 92.0% (85.1%) with a larger training set of 5000 segments.</description>

      <title>APCoTTA: Continual Test-Time Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation of Airborne LiDAR Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Airborne laser scanning (ALS) point cloud semantic segmentation is a fundamental task for large-scale 3D scene understanding. Fixed models deployed in real-world scenarios often suffer from performance degradation due to continuous domain shifts caused by environmental and sensor changes. Continuous Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) enables adaptation to evolving unlabeled domains, but its application to ALS point clouds remains underexplored, hindered by the lack of benchmarks and the risks of catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation. To address these challenges, we propose APCoTTA (ALS Point cloud Continuous Test-Time Adaptation), a novel CTTA framework tailored for ALS point cloud semantic segmentation. APCoTTA consists of three key components. First, we adapt a gradient-driven layer selection mechanism for ALS point clouds, selectively updating low-confidence layers while freezing stable ones to preserve source knowledge and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Second, an entropy-based consistency loss discards unreliable samples and enforces consistency regularization solely on reliable ones, effectively reducing error accumulation and improving adaptation stability. Third, a random parameter interpolation mechanism stochastically blends adapted parameters with source model parameters, further balancing target adaptation and source knowledge retention. Finally, we construct two benchmarks, ISPRSC and H3DC, to address the lack of CTTA benchmarks for ALS point cloud segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that APCoTTA achieves superior performance on both benchmarks, improving mIoU by approximately 9\% and 14\% over direct inference. The new benchmarks and code are available at https://github.com/Gaoyuan2/APCoTTA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing visual place recognition (VPR) datasets predominantly rely on vehicle-mounted imagery, offer limited multimodal diversity, and underrepresent dense pedestrian street scenes, particularly in non-Western urban contexts. We introduce MMS-VPR, a large-scale multimodal dataset for street-level place recognition in pedestrian-only environments. MMS-VPR comprises 110,529 images and 2,527 video clips across 208 locations in a ~70,800 $m^2$ open-air commercial district in Chengdu, China. Field data were collected in 2024, while social media data span seven years (2019-2025), providing both fine-grained temporal granularity and long-term temporal coverage. Each location features comprehensive day-night coverage, multiple viewing angles, and multimodal annotations including GPS coordinates, timestamps, and semantic textual metadata. We further release MMS-VPRlib, a unified benchmarking platform that consolidates commonly used VPR datasets and state-of-the-art methods under a standardized, reproducible pipeline. MMS-VPRlib provides modular components for data pre-processing, multimodal modeling (CNN/RNN/Transformer), signal enhancement, alignment, fusion, and performance evaluation. This platform moves beyond traditional image-only paradigms, enabling systematic exploitation of complementary visual, video, and textual modalities. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Yiwei-Ou/MMS-VPR and the benchmark at https://github.com/yiasun/MMS-VPRlib.</description>

      <title>cadrille: Multi-modal CAD Reconstruction with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a central role in engineering and manufacturing, making it possible to create precise and editable 3D models. Using a variety of sensor or user-provided data as inputs for CAD reconstruction can democratize access to design applications. However, existing methods typically focus on a single input modality, such as point clouds, images, or text, which limits their generalizability and robustness. Leveraging recent advances in vision-language models (VLM), we propose a multi-modal CAD reconstruction model that simultaneously processes all three input modalities. Inspired by large language model (LLM) training paradigms, we adopt a two-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on large-scale procedurally generated data, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning using online feedback, obtained programatically. Furthermore, we are the first to explore RL fine-tuning of LLMs for CAD tasks demonstrating that online RL algorithms such as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO) outperform offline alternatives. In the DeepCAD benchmark, our SFT model outperforms existing single-modal approaches in all three input modalities simultaneously. More importantly, after RL fine-tuning, cadrille sets new state-of-the-art on three challenging datasets, including a real-world one.

      <title>Prompts to Summaries: Zero-Shot Language-Guided Video Summarization with Large Language and Video Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The explosive growth of video data intensified the need for flexible user-controllable summarization tools that operate without training data. Existing methods either rely on domain-specific datasets, limiting generalization, or cannot incorporate user intent expressed in natural language. We introduce Prompts-to-Summaries: the first zero-shot, text-queryable video-summarizer that converts off-the-shelf video-language models (VidLMs) captions into user-guided skims via large-language-models (LLMs) judging, without the use of training data, beating unsupervised and matching supervised methods. Our pipeline (i) segments video into scenes, (ii) produces scene descriptions with a memory-efficient batch prompting scheme that scales to hours on a single GPU, (iii) scores scene importance with an LLM via tailored prompts, and (iv) propagates scores to frames using new consistency (temporal coherence) and uniqueness (novelty) metrics for fine-grained frame importance. On SumMe and TVSum, our approach surpasses all prior data-hungry unsupervised methods and performs competitively on the Query-Focused Video Summarization benchmark, where the competing methods require supervised frame-level importance. We release VidSum-Reason, a query-driven dataset featuring long-tailed concepts and multi-step reasoning, where our framework serves as the first challenging baseline. Overall, we demonstrate that pretrained multi-modal models, when orchestrated with principled prompting and score propagation, provide a powerful foundation for universal, text-queryable video summarization.</description>

      <title>Pyramidal Patchification Flow for Visual Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion transformers (DiTs) adopt Patchify, mapping patch representations to token representations through linear projections, to adjust the number of tokens input to DiT blocks and thus the computation cost. Instead of a single patch size for all the timesteps, we introduce a Pyramidal Patchification Flow (PPFlow) approach: Large patch sizes are used for high noise timesteps and small patch sizes for low noise timesteps; Linear projections are learned for each patch size; and Unpatchify is accordingly modified. Unlike Pyramidal Flow, our approach operates over full latent representations other than pyramid representations, and adopts the normal denoising process without requiring the renoising trick. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two training manners. Training from scratch achieves a $1.6\times$ ($2.0\times$) inference speed over SiT-B/2 for 2-level (3-level) pyramid patchification with slightly lower training FLOPs and similar image generation performance. Training from pretrained normal DiTs achieves even better performance with small training time. The code and checkpoint are at https://github.com/fudan-generative-vision/PPFlow.</description>

      <title>Query-Based Adaptive Aggregation for Multi-Dataset Joint Training Toward Universal Visual Place Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning methods for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) have advanced significantly, largely driven by large-scale datasets. However, most existing approaches are trained on a single dataset, which can introduce dataset-specific inductive biases and limit model generalization. While multi-dataset joint training offers a promising solution for developing universal VPR models, divergences among training datasets can saturate the limited information capacity in feature aggregation layers, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose Query-based Adaptive Aggregation (QAA), a novel feature aggregation technique that leverages learned queries as reference codebooks to effectively enhance information capacity without significant computational or parameter complexity. We show that computing the Cross-query Similarity (CS) between query-level image features and reference codebooks provides a simple yet effective way to generate robust descriptors. Our results demonstrate that QAA outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving balanced generalization across diverse datasets while maintaining peak performance comparable to dataset-specific models. Ablation studies further explore QAA's mechanisms and scalability. Visualizations reveal that the learned queries exhibit diverse attention patterns across datasets.

      <title>THUNDER: Tile-level Histopathology image UNDERstanding benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Progress in a research field can be hard to assess, in particular when many concurrent methods are proposed in a short period of time. This is the case in digital pathology, where many foundation models have been released recently to serve as feature extractors for tile-level images, being used in a variety of downstream tasks, both for tile- and slide-level problems. Benchmarking available methods then becomes paramount to get a clearer view of the research landscape. In particular, in critical domains such as healthcare, a benchmark should not only focus on evaluating downstream performance, but also provide insights about the main differences between methods, and importantly, further consider uncertainty and robustness to ensure a reliable usage of proposed models. For these reasons, we introduce THUNDER, a tile-level benchmark for digital pathology foundation models, allowing for efficient comparison of many models on diverse datasets with a series of downstream tasks, studying their feature spaces and assessing the robustness and uncertainty of predictions informed by their embeddings. THUNDER is a fast, easy-to-use, dynamic benchmark that can already support a large variety of state-of-the-art foundation, as well as local user-defined models for direct tile-based comparison. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16 different datasets covering diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness. The code for THUNDER is publicly available at https://github.com/MICS-Lab/thunder.</description>

      <title>FedX: Explanation-Guided Pruning for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning in Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables the collaborative training of deep neural networks across decentralized data archives (i.e., clients), where each client stores data locally and only shares model updates with a central server. This makes FL a suitable learning paradigm for remote sensing (RS) image classification tasks, where data centralization may be restricted due to legal and privacy constraints. However, a key challenge in applying FL to RS tasks is the communication overhead caused by the frequent exchange of large model updates between clients and the central server. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a novel strategy (denoted as FedX) that uses explanation-guided pruning to reduce communication overhead by minimizing the size of the transmitted models without compromising performance. FedX leverages backpropagation-based explanation methods to estimate the task-specific importance of model components and prunes the least relevant ones at the central server. The resulting sparse global model is then sent to clients, substantially reducing communication overhead. We evaluate FedX on multi-label scene classification using the BigEarthNet-S2 dataset and single-label scene classification using the EuroSAT dataset. Experimental results show the success of FedX in significantly reducing the number of shared model parameters while enhancing the generalization capability of the global model, compared to both unpruned model and state-of-the-art pruning methods. The code of FedX will be available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/FedX.</description>

      <title>VLCE: A Knowledge-Enhanced Framework for Image Description in Disaster Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21609v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The processes of classification and segmentation utilizing artificial intelligence play a vital role in the automation of disaster assessments. However, contemporary VLMs produce details that are inadequately aligned with the objectives of disaster assessment, primarily due to their deficiency in domain knowledge and the absence of a more refined descriptive process. This research presents the Vision Language Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a dedicated multimodal framework aimed at integrating external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to improve the captioning process. The objective is to produce disaster-specific descriptions that effectively convert raw visual data into actionable intelligence. VLCE utilizes two separate architectures: a CNN-LSTM model that incorporates a ResNet50 backbone, pretrained on EuroSat for satellite imagery (xBD dataset), and a Vision Transformer developed for UAV imagery (RescueNet dataset). In various architectural frameworks and datasets, VLCE exhibits a consistent advantage over baseline models such as LLaVA and QwenVL. Our optimal configuration reaches an impressive 95.33\% on InfoMetIC for UAV imagery while also demonstrating strong performance across satellite imagery. The proposed framework signifies a significant transition from basic visual classification to the generation of comprehensive situational intelligence, demonstrating immediate applicability for implementation in real-time disaster assessment systems.</description>

      <title>Generating Findings for Jaw Cysts in Dental Panoramic Radiographs Using a GPT-Based VLM: A Preliminary Study on Building a Two-Stage Self-Correction Loop with Structured Output (SLSO) Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02001v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as GPT (Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) have shown potential for medical image interpretation; however, challenges remain in generating reliable radiological findings in clinical practice, as exemplified by dental pathologies. This study proposes a Self-correction Loop with Structured Output (SLSO) framework as an integrated processing methodology to enhance the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated findings for jaw cysts in dental panoramic radiographs. Dental panoramic radiographs with jaw cysts were used to implement a 10-step integrated processing framework incorporating image analysis, structured data generation, tooth number extraction, consistency checking, and iterative regeneration. The framework functioned as an external validation mechanism for GPT outputs. Performance was compared against the conventional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method across seven evaluation items: transparency, internal structure, borders, root resorption, tooth movement, relationships with other structures, and tooth number. The SLSO framework improved output accuracy for multiple items compared to the CoT method, with the most notable improvements observed in tooth number identification, tooth movement detection, and root resorption assessment. In successful cases, consistently structured outputs were achieved after up to five regenerations. The framework enforced explicit negative finding descriptions and suppressed hallucinations, although accurate identification of extensive lesions spanning multiple teeth remained limited. This investigation established the feasibility of the proposed integrated processing methodology and provided a foundation for future validation studies with larger, more diverse datasets.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fully interpretable and flexible statistical method for background subtraction in roadside LiDAR data, aimed at enhancing infrastructure-based perception in automated driving. Our approach introduces both a Gaussian distribution grid (GDG), which models the spatial statistics of the background using background-only scans, and a filtering algorithm that uses this representation to classify LiDAR points as foreground or background. The method supports diverse LiDAR types, including multiline 360 degree and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) sensors, and adapts to various configurations. Evaluated on the publicly available RCooper dataset, it outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in accuracy and flexibility, even with minimal background data. Its efficient implementation ensures reliable performance on low-resource hardware, enabling scalable real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Long Grounded Thoughts: Synthesizing Visual Problems and Reasoning Chains at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite rapid progress, multimodal reasoning still lacks a systematic approach to synthesize large-scale vision-centric datasets beyond visual math. We introduce a framework able to synthesize vision-centric problems spanning diverse levels of complexity, and the resulting dataset with over 1M high-quality problems including: reasoning traces, preference data, and instruction prompts supporting SFT, offline and online RL. Our vision-centric synthesis framework uses a two-stage process focusing on: (1) generating diverse verifiable questions from existing images at scale, and (2) creating complex compositional visual problems by merging simpler questions. Remarkably, finetuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on our data outperforms existing open-data baselines across evaluated vision-centric benchmarks, and our best configurations match or surpass strong closed-data models such as MiMo-VL-7B-RL on Vstar Bench, CV-Bench and MMStar-V. Notably, despite being entirely vision-centric, our data transfers positively to text-only reasoning (MMLU-Pro, +3.7%) and audio reasoning (MMAU, +1.32%), demonstrating its effectiveness. Similarly, despite containing no embodied visual data, we observe notable gains (NiEH, +8.8%) when evaluating open-ended embodied QA. Lastly, we use our data to comprehensively analyze at scale (1M+) the entire VLM post-training pipeline showing that (i) SFT on high-quality data with cognitive behaviors on reasoning traces is essential to scale online RL, (ii) offline RL could match online RL's performance while disaggregating compute demands, and, (iii) SFT on high quality data also improve out-of-domain, cross-modality transfer.</description>

      <title>MRIQT: Physics-Aware Diffusion Model for Image Quality Transfer in Neonatal Ultra-Low-Field MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Portable ultra-low-field MRI (uLF-MRI, 0.064 T) offers accessible neuroimaging for neonatal care but suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio and poor diagnostic quality compared to high-field (HF) MRI. We propose MRIQT, a 3D conditional diffusion framework for image quality transfer (IQT) from uLF to HF MRI. MRIQT combines realistic K-space degradation for physics-consistent uLF simulation, v-prediction with classifier-free guidance for stable image-to-image generation, and an SNR-weighted 3D perceptual loss for anatomical fidelity. The model denoises from a noised uLF input conditioned on the same scan, leveraging volumetric attention-UNet architecture for structure-preserving translation. Trained on a neonatal cohort with diverse pathologies, MRIQT surpasses recent GAN and CNN baselines in PSNR 15.3% with 1.78% over the state of the art, while physicians rated 85% of its outputs as good quality with clear pathology present. MRIQT enables high-fidelity, diffusion-based enhancement of portable ultra-low-field (uLF) MRI for deliable neonatal brain assessment.</description>

      <title>Text-Guided Layer Fusion Mitigates Hallucination in Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically rely on a single late-layer feature from a frozen vision encoder, leaving the encoder's rich hierarchy of visual cues under-utilized. MLLMs still suffer from visually ungrounded hallucinations, often relying on language priors rather than image evidence. While many prior mitigation strategies operate on the text side, they leave the visual representation unchanged and do not exploit the rich hierarchy of features encoded across vision layers. Existing multi-layer fusion methods partially address this limitation but remain static, applying the same layer mixture regardless of the query. In this work, we introduce TGIF (Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion), a lightweight module that treats encoder layers as depth-wise "experts" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features. TGIF follows the principle of direct external fusion, requires no vision-encoder updates, and adds minimal overhead. Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks, while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench. These results suggest that query-conditioned, hierarchy-aware fusion is an effective way to strengthen visual grounding and reduce hallucination in modern MLLMs.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Refinement of Universal Multimodal Attacks on Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing adversarial attacks for VLP models are mostly sample-specific, resulting in substantial computational overhead when scaled to large datasets or new scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Refinement Attack (HRA), a multimodal universal attack framework for VLP models. For the image modality, we refine the optimization path by leveraging a temporal hierarchy of historical and estimated future gradients to avoid local minima and stabilize universal perturbation learning. For the text modality, it hierarchically models textual importance by considering both intra- and inter-sentence contributions to identify globally influential words, which are then used as universal text perturbations. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks, VLP models, and datasets, demonstrate the superior transferability of the proposed universal multimodal attacks.</description>

      <title>TTSA3R: Training-Free Temporal-Spatial Adaptive Persistent State for Streaming 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Streaming recurrent models enable efficient 3D reconstruction by maintaining persistent state representations. However, they suffer from catastrophic forgetting over long sequences due to balancing historical information with new observations. Recent methods alleviate this by deriving adaptive signals from attention perspective, but they operate on single dimensions without considering temporal and spatial consistency. To this end, we propose a training-free framework termed TTSA3R that leverages both temporal state evolution and spatial observation quality for adaptive state updates in 3D reconstruction. In particular, we devise a Temporal Adaptive Update Module that regulates update magnitude by analyzing temporal state evolution patterns. Then, a Spatial Contextual Update Module is introduced to localize spatial regions that require updates through observation-state alignment and scene dynamics. These complementary signals are finally fused to determine the state updating strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TTSA3R in diverse 3D tasks. Moreover, our method exhibits only 1.33x error increase compared to over 4x degradation in the baseline model on extended sequences of 3D reconstruction, significantly improving long-term reconstruction stability.

      <title>Cross-Modal Purification and Fusion for Small-Object RGB-D Transmission-Line Defect Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01696v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transmission line defect detection remains challenging for automated UAV inspection due to the dominance of small-scale defects, complex backgrounds, and illumination variations. Existing RGB-based detectors, despite recent progress, struggle to distinguish geometrically subtle defects from visually similar background structures under limited chromatic contrast. This paper proposes CMAFNet, a Cross-Modal Alignment and Fusion Network that integrates RGB appearance and depth geometry through a principled purify-then-fuse paradigm. CMAFNet consists of a Semantic Recomposition Module that performs dictionary-based feature purification via a learned codebook to suppress modality-specific noise while preserving defect-discriminative information, and a Contextual Semantic Integration Framework that captures global spatial dependencies using partial-channel attention to enhance structural semantic reasoning. Position-wise normalization within the purification stage enforces explicit reconstruction-driven cross-modal alignment, ensuring statistical compatibility between heterogeneous features prior to fusion. Extensive experiments on the TLRGBD benchmark, where 94.5% of instances are small objects, demonstrate that CMAFNet achieves 32.2% mAP@50 and 12.5% APs, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8 and 4.0 percentage points, respectively. A lightweight variant reaches 24.8% mAP50 at 228 FPS with only 4.9M parameters, surpassing all YOLO-based detectors while matching transformer-based methods at substantially lower computational cost.</description>

      <title>Prompt Reinjection: Alleviating Prompt Forgetting in Multimodal Diffusion Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiTs) for text-to-image generation maintain separate text and image branches, with bidirectional information flow between text tokens and visual latents throughout denoising. In this setting, we observe a prompt forgetting phenomenon: the semantics of the prompt representation in the text branch is progressively forgotten as depth increases. We further verify this effect on three representative MMDiTs--SD3, SD3.5, and FLUX.1 by probing linguistic attributes of the representations over the layers in the text branch. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a training-free approach, prompt reinjection, which reinjects prompt representations from early layers into later layers to alleviate this forgetting. Experiments on GenEval, DPG, and T2I-CompBench++ show consistent gains in instruction-following capability, along with improvements on metrics capturing preference, aesthetics, and overall text--image generation quality.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Aware Rotary Position Embedding for Consistent Video World Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predictive world models that simulate future observations under explicit camera control are fundamental to interactive AI. Despite rapid advances, current systems lack spatial persistence: they fail to maintain stable scene structures over long trajectories, frequently hallucinating details when cameras revisit previously observed locations. We identify that this geometric drift stems from reliance on screen-space positional embeddings, which conflict with the projective geometry required for 3D consistency. We introduce \textbf{ViewRope}, a geometry-aware encoding that injects camera-ray directions directly into video transformer self-attention layers. By parameterizing attention with relative ray geometry rather than pixel locality, ViewRope provides a model-native inductive bias for retrieving 3D-consistent content across temporal gaps. We further propose \textbf{Geometry-Aware Frame-Sparse Attention}, which exploits these geometric cues to selectively attend to relevant historical frames, improving efficiency without sacrificing memory consistency. We also present \textbf{ViewBench}, a diagnostic suite measuring loop-closure fidelity and geometric drift. Our results demonstrate that ViewRope substantially improves long-term consistency while reducing computational costs.</description>

      <title>LeafNet: A Large-Scale Dataset and Comprehensive Benchmark for Foundational Vision-Language Understanding of Plant Diseases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models and vision-language pre-training have significantly advanced Vision-Language Models (VLMs), enabling multimodal processing of visual and linguistic data. However, their application in domain-specific agricultural tasks, such as plant pathology, remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, comprehensive multimodal image--text datasets and benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce LeafNet, a comprehensive multimodal dataset, and LeafBench, a visual question-answering benchmark developed to systematically evaluate the capabilities of VLMs in understanding plant diseases. The dataset comprises 186,000 leaf digital images spanning 97 disease classes, paired with metadata, generating 13,950 question-answer pairs spanning six critical agricultural tasks. The questions assess various aspects of plant pathology understanding, including visual symptom recognition, taxonomic relationships, and diagnostic reasoning. Benchmarking 12 state-of-the-art VLMs on our LeafBench dataset, we reveal substantial disparity in their disease understanding capabilities. Our study shows performance varies markedly across tasks: binary healthy--diseased classification exceeds 90\% accuracy, while fine-grained pathogen and species identification remains below 65\%. Direct comparison between vision-only models and VLMs demonstrates the critical advantage of multimodal architectures: fine-tuned VLMs outperform traditional vision models, confirming that integrating linguistic representations significantly enhances diagnostic precision. These findings highlight critical gaps in current VLMs for plant pathology applications and underscore the need for LeafBench as a rigorous framework for methodological advancement and progress evaluation toward reliable AI-assisted plant disease diagnosis.

      <title>Train Short, Inference Long: Training-free Horizon Extension for Autoregressive Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models have emerged as a scalable paradigm for long video generation. However, they often suffer from severe extrapolation failure, where rapid error accumulation leads to significant temporal degradation when extending beyond training horizons. We identify that this failure primarily stems from the spectral bias of 3D positional embeddings and the lack of dynamic priors in noise sampling. To address these issues, we propose FLEX (Frequency-aware Length EXtension), a training-free inference-time framework that bridges the gap between short-term training and long-term inference. FLEX introduces Frequency-aware RoPE Modulation to adaptively interpolate under-trained low-frequency components while extrapolating high-frequency ones to preserve multi-scale temporal discriminability. This is integrated with Antiphase Noise Sampling (ANS) to inject high-frequency dynamic priors and Inference-only Attention Sink to anchor global structure. Extensive evaluations on VBench demonstrate that FLEX significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models at 6x extrapolation (30s duration) and matches the performance of long-video fine-tuned baselines at 12x scale (60s duration). As a plug-and-play augmentation, FLEX seamlessly integrates into existing inference pipelines for horizon extension. It effectively pushes the generation limits of models such as LongLive, supporting consistent and dynamic video synthesis at a 4-minute scale.

      <title>Just KIDDIN: Knowledge Infusion and Distillation for Detection of INdecent Memes</title>

Abstract: Toxicity identification in online multimodal environments remains a challenging task due to the complexity of contextual connections across modalities (e.g., textual and visual). In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) from Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) and knowledge infusion to enhance the performance of toxicity detection in hateful memes. Our approach extracts sub-knowledge graphs from ConceptNet, a large-scale commonsense Knowledge Graph (KG) to be infused within a compact VLM framework. The relational context between toxic phrases in captions and memes, as well as visual concepts in memes enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. Experimental results from our study on two hate speech benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance over the state-of-the-art baselines across AU-ROC, F1, and Recall with improvements of 1.1%, 7%, and 35%, respectively. Given the contextual complexity of the toxicity detection task, our approach showcases the significance of learning from both explicit (i.e. KG) as well as implicit (i.e. LVLMs) contextual cues incorporated through a hybrid neurosymbolic approach. This is crucial for real-world applications where accurate and scalable recognition of toxic content is critical for creating safer online environments.</description>

      <title>Efficient Semi-Supervised Adversarial Training via Latent Clustering-Based Data Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning robust models under adversarial settings is widely recognized as requiring a considerably large number of training samples. Recent work proposes semi-supervised adversarial training (SSAT), which utilizes external unlabeled or synthetically generated data and is currently the state of the art. However, SSAT requires substantial extra data to attain high robustness, resulting in prolonged training time and increased memory usage. In this paper, we propose data reduction strategies to improve the efficiency of SSAT by optimizing the amount of additional data incorporated. Specifically, we design novel latent clustering-based techniques to select or generate a small, critical subset of data samples near the model's decision boundary. While focusing on boundary-adjacent points, our methods maintain a balanced ratio between boundary and non-boundary data points, thereby avoiding overfitting. Comprehensive experiments across image benchmarks demonstrate that our methods can effectively reduce SSAT's data requirements and computational costs while preserving its strong robustness advantages. In particular, our latent-space selection scheme based on k-means clustering and our guided diffusion-based approach with LCG-KM are the most effective, achieving nearly identical robust accuracies with 5 times to 10 times less unlabeled data. When compared to full SSAT trained to convergence, our methods reduce total runtime by approximately 3 times to 4 times due to strategic prioritization of unlabeled data.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Integrated Knowledge Transfer to Large Language Models through Preference Optimization with Biomedical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality multimodal biomedical data limits the ability to effectively fine-tune pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) for specialized biomedical tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce MINT (Multimodal Integrated kNowledge Transfer), a framework that aligns unimodal large decoder models with domain-specific decision patterns from multimodal biomedical data through preference optimization. While MINT supports different optimization techniques, we primarily implement it with the Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) framework as its backbone. This strategy enables the aligned LLMs to perform predictive tasks using text-only or image-only inputs while retaining knowledge learnt from multimodal data. MINT leverages an upstream multimodal machine learning (MML) model trained on high-quality multimodal data to transfer domain-specific insights to downstream text-only or image-only LLMs. We demonstrate its effectiveness through two key applications: (1) Rare genetic disease prediction from texts, where MINT uses a multimodal encoder model, trained on facial photos and clinical notes, to generate a preference dataset for aligning a lightweight Llama 3.2-3B-Instruct. Despite relying on text input only, the MINT-derived model outperforms models trained with SFT, RAG, or DPO, and even outperforms Llama 3.1-405B-Instruct. (2) Tissue type classification using cell nucleus images, where MINT uses a vision-language foundation model as the preference generator, containing knowledge learnt from both text and histopathological images to align downstream image-only models. The resulting MINT-derived model significantly improves the performance of Llama 3.2-Vision-11B-Instruct on tissue type classification. In summary, MINT provides an effective strategy to align unimodal LLMs with high-quality multimodal expertise through preference optimization.</description>

      <title>DreamAnywhere: Object-Centric Panoramic 3D Scene Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-3D scene generation have demonstrated significant potential to transform content creation across multiple industries. Although the research community has made impressive progress in addressing the challenges of this complex task, existing methods often generate environments that are only front-facing, lack visual fidelity, exhibit limited scene understanding, and are typically fine-tuned for either indoor or outdoor settings. In this work, we address these issues and propose DreamAnywhere, a modular system for the fast generation and prototyping of 3D scenes. Our system synthesizes a 360{\deg} panoramic image from text, decomposes it into background and objects, constructs a complete 3D representation through hybrid inpainting, and lifts object masks to detailed 3D objects that are placed in the virtual environment. DreamAnywhere supports immersive navigation and intuitive object-level editing, making it ideal for scene exploration, visual mock-ups, and rapid prototyping -- all with minimal manual modeling. These features make our system particularly suitable for low-budget movie production, enabling quick iteration on scene layout and visual tone without the overhead of traditional 3D workflows. Our modular pipeline is highly customizable as it allows components to be replaced independently. Compared to current state-of-the-art text and image-based 3D scene generation approaches, DreamAnywhere shows significant improvements in coherence in novel view synthesis and achieves competitive image quality, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse and challenging scenarios. A comprehensive user study demonstrates a clear preference for our method over existing approaches, validating both its technical robustness and practical usefulness.</description>

      <title>Towards Geometric and Textural Consistency 3D Scene Generation via Single Image-guided Model Generation and Layout Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, 3D generation has made great strides in both academia and industry. However, generating 3D scenes from a single RGB image remains a significant challenge, as current approaches often struggle to ensure both object generation quality and scene coherence in multi-object scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel three-stage framework for 3D scene generation with explicit geometric representations and high-quality textural details via single image-guided model generation and spatial layout optimization. Our method begins with an image instance segmentation and inpainting phase, which recovers missing details of occluded objects in the input images, thereby achieving complete generation of foreground 3D assets. Subsequently, our approach captures the spatial geometry of reference image by constructing pseudo-stereo viewpoint for camera parameter estimation and scene depth inference, while employing a model selection strategy to ensure optimal alignment between the 3D assets generated in the previous step and the input. Finally, through model parameterization and minimization of the Chamfer distance between point clouds in 3D and 2D space, our approach optimizes layout parameters to produce an explicit 3D scene representation that maintains precise alignment with input guidance image. Extensive experiments on multi-object scene image sets have demonstrated that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric accuracy and texture fidelity of individual generated 3D models, but also has significant advantages in scene layout synthesis.</description>

      <title>ZeroScene: A Zero-Shot Framework for 3D Scene Generation from a Single Image and Controllable Texture Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of 3D content generation, single image scene reconstruction methods still struggle to simultaneously ensure the quality of individual assets and the coherence of the overall scene in complex environments, while texture editing techniques often fail to maintain both local continuity and multi-view consistency. In this paper, we propose a novel system ZeroScene, which leverages the prior knowledge of large vision models to accomplish both single image-to-3D scene reconstruction and texture editing in a zero-shot manner. ZeroScene extracts object-level 2D segmentation and depth information from input images to infer spatial relationships within the scene. It then jointly optimizes 3D and 2D projection losses of the point cloud to update object poses for precise scene alignment, ultimately constructing a coherent and complete 3D scene that encompasses both foreground and background. Moreover, ZeroScene supports texture editing of objects in the scene. By imposing constraints on the diffusion model and introducing a mask-guided progressive image generation strategy, we effectively maintain texture consistency across multiple viewpoints and further enhance the realism of rendered results through Physically Based Rendering (PBR) material estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only ensures the geometric and appearance accuracy of generated assets, but also faithfully reconstructs scene layouts and produces highly detailed textures that closely align with text prompts.</description>

      <title>Terminal Velocity Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Terminal Velocity Matching (TVM), a generalization of flow matching that enables high-fidelity one- and few-step generative modeling. TVM models the transition between any two diffusion timesteps and regularizes its behavior at its terminal time rather than at the initial time. We prove that TVM provides an upper bound on the $2$-Wasserstein distance between data and model distributions when the model is Lipschitz continuous. However, since Diffusion Transformers lack this property, we introduce minimal architectural changes that achieve stable, single-stage training. To make TVM efficient in practice, we develop a fused attention kernel that supports backward passes on Jacobian-Vector Products, which scale well with transformer architectures. On ImageNet-256x256, TVM achieves 3.29 FID with a single function evaluation (NFE) and 1.99 FID with 4 NFEs. It similarly achieves 4.32 1-NFE FID and 2.94 4-NFE FID on ImageNet-512x512, representing state-of-the-art performance for one/few-step models from scratch.</description>

Abstract: Project Sidewalk is a web-based platform that enables crowdsourcing accessibility of sidewalks at city-scale by virtually walking through city streets using Google Street View. The tool has been used in 40 cities across the world, including the US, Mexico, Chile, and Europe. In this paper, we describe adaptation efforts to enable deployment in Chandigarh, India, including modifying annotation types, provided examples, and integrating VLM-based mission guidance, which adapts instructions based on a street scene and metadata analysis. Our evaluation with 3 annotators indicates the utility of AI-mission guidance with an average score of 4.66. Using this adapted Project Sidewalk tool, we conduct a Points of Interest (POI)-centric accessibility analysis for three sectors in Chandigarh with very different land uses, residential, commercial and institutional covering about 40 km of sidewalks. Across 40 km of roads audited in three sectors and around 230 POIs, we identified 1,644 of 2,913 locations where infrastructure improvements could enhance accessibility.</description>
