      <title>Agentic AI Needs a Systems Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The endowment of AI with reasoning capabilities and some degree of agency is widely viewed as a path toward more capable and generalizable systems. Our position is that the current development of agentic AI requires a more holistic, systems-theoretic perspective in order to fully understand their capabilities and mitigate any emergent risks. The primary motivation for our position is that AI development is currently overly focused on individual model capabilities, often ignoring broader emergent behavior, leading to a significant underestimation in the true capabilities and associated risks of agentic AI. We describe some fundamental mechanisms by which advanced capabilities can emerge from (comparably simpler) agents simply due to their interaction with the environment and other agents. Informed by an extensive amount of existing literature from various fields, we outline mechanisms for enhanced agent cognition, emergent causal reasoning ability, and metacognitive awareness. We conclude by presenting some key open challenges and guidance for the development of agentic AI. We emphasize that a systems-level perspective is essential for better understanding, and purposefully shaping, agentic AI systems.</description>

      <title>Human-AI Collaboration: Trade-offs Between Performance and Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the growing interest in collaborative AI, designing systems that seamlessly integrate human input remains a major challenge. In this study, we developed a task to systematically examine human preferences for collaborative agents. We created and evaluated five collaborative AI agents with strategies that differ in the manner and degree they adapt to human actions. Participants interacted with a subset of these agents, evaluated their perceived traits, and selected their preferred agent. We used a Bayesian model to understand how agents' strategies influence the Human-AI team performance, AI's perceived traits, and the factors shaping human-preferences in pairwise agent comparisons. Our results show that agents who are more considerate of human actions are preferred over purely performance-maximizing agents. Moreover, we show that such human-centric design can improve the likability of AI collaborators without reducing performance. We find evidence for inequality-aversion effects being a driver of human choices, suggesting that people prefer collaborative agents which allow them to meaningfully contribute to the team. Taken together, these findings demonstrate how collaboration with AI can benefit from development efforts which include both subjective and objective metrics.</description>

      <title>Instructor-Worker Large Language Model System for Policy Recommendation: a Case Study on Air Quality Analysis of the January 2025 Los Angeles Wildfires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Los Angeles wildfires of January 2025 caused more than 250 billion dollars in damage and lasted for nearly an entire month before containment. Following our previous work, the Digital Twin Building, we modify and leverage the multi-agent large language model framework as well as the cloud-mapping integration to study the air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires. Recent advances in large language models have allowed for out-of-the-box automated large-scale data analysis. We use a multi-agent large language system comprised of an Instructor agent and Worker agents. Upon receiving the users' instructions, the Instructor agent retrieves the data from the cloud platform and produces instruction prompts to the Worker agents. The Worker agents then analyze the data and provide summaries. The summaries are finally input back into the Instructor agent, which then provides the final data analysis. We test this system's capability for data-based policy recommendation by assessing our Instructor-Worker LLM system's health recommendations based on air quality during the Los Angeles wildfires.</description>

      <title>Modeling Arbitrarily Applicable Relational Responding with the Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System: A Machine Psychology Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arbitrarily Applicable Relational Responding (AARR) is a cornerstone of human language and reasoning, referring to the learned ability to relate symbols in flexible, context-dependent ways. In this paper, we present a novel theoretical approach for modeling AARR within an artificial intelligence framework using the Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS). NARS is an adaptive reasoning system designed for learning under uncertainty. By integrating principles from Relational Frame Theory - the behavioral psychology account of AARR - with the reasoning mechanisms of NARS, we conceptually demonstrate how key properties of AARR (mutual entailment, combinatorial entailment, and transformation of stimulus functions) can emerge from the inference rules and memory structures of NARS. Two theoretical experiments illustrate this approach: one modeling stimulus equivalence and transfer of function, and another modeling complex relational networks involving opposition frames. In both cases, the system logically demonstrates the derivation of untrained relations and context-sensitive transformations of stimulus significance, mirroring established human cognitive phenomena. These results suggest that AARR - long considered uniquely human - can be conceptually captured by suitably designed AI systems, highlighting the value of integrating behavioral science insights into artificial general intelligence (AGI) research.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Light Decoder-based Solvers for Vehicle Routing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light decoder-based solvers have gained popularity for solving vehicle routing problems (VRPs) due to their efficiency and ease of integration with reinforcement learning algorithms. However, they often struggle with generalization to larger problem instances or different VRP variants. This paper revisits light decoder-based approaches, analyzing the implications of their reliance on static embeddings and the inherent challenges that arise. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the light decoder paradigm, the encoder is implicitly tasked with capturing information for all potential decision scenarios during solution construction within a single set of embeddings, resulting in high information density. Furthermore, our empirical analysis reveals that the overly simplistic decoder struggles to effectively utilize this dense information, particularly as task complexity increases, which limits generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. Building on these insights, we show that enhancing the decoder capacity, with a simple addition of identity mapping and a feed-forward layer, can considerably alleviate the generalization issue. Experimentally, our method significantly enhances the OOD generalization of light decoder-based approaches on large-scale instances and complex VRP variants, narrowing the gap with the heavy decoder paradigm.

      <title>A Law Reasoning Benchmark for LLM with Tree-Organized Structures including Factum Probandum, Evidence and Experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While progress has been made in legal applications, law reasoning, crucial for fair adjudication, remains unexplored. We propose a transparent law reasoning schema enriched with hierarchical factum probandum, evidence, and implicit experience, enabling public scrutiny and preventing bias. Inspired by this schema, we introduce the challenging task, which takes a textual case description and outputs a hierarchical structure justifying the final decision. We also create the first crowd-sourced dataset for this task, enabling comprehensive evaluation. Simultaneously, we propose an agent framework that employs a comprehensive suite of legal analysis tools to address the challenge task. This benchmark paves the way for transparent and accountable AI-assisted law reasoning in the ``Intelligent Court''.</description>

      <title>NeSyC: A Neuro-symbolic Continual Learner For Complex Embodied Tasks In Open Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore neuro-symbolic approaches to generalize actionable knowledge, enabling embodied agents to tackle complex tasks more effectively in open-domain environments. A key challenge for embodied agents is the generalization of knowledge across diverse environments and situations, as limited experiences often confine them to their prior knowledge. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework, NeSyC, a neuro-symbolic continual learner that emulates the hypothetico-deductive model by continually formulating and validating knowledge from limited experiences through the combined use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and symbolic tools. Specifically, we devise a contrastive generality improvement scheme within NeSyC, which iteratively generates hypotheses using LLMs and conducts contrastive validation via symbolic tools. This scheme reinforces the justification for admissible actions while minimizing the inference of inadmissible ones. Additionally, we incorporate a memory-based monitoring scheme that efficiently detects action errors and triggers the knowledge refinement process across domains. Experiments conducted on diverse embodied task benchmarks-including ALFWorld, VirtualHome, Minecraft, RLBench, and a real-world robotic scenario-demonstrate that NeSyC is highly effective in solving complex embodied tasks across a range of open-domain environments.</description>

      <title>Evidence of conceptual mastery in the application of rules by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we leverage psychological methods to investigate LLMs' conceptual mastery in applying rules. We introduce a novel procedure to match the diversity of thought generated by LLMs to that observed in a human sample. We then conducted two experiments comparing rule-based decision-making in humans and LLMs. Study 1 found that all investigated LLMs replicated human patterns regardless of whether they are prompted with scenarios created before or after their training cut-off. Moreover, we found unanticipated differences between the two sets of scenarios among humans. Surprisingly, even these differences were replicated in LLM responses. Study 2 turned to a contextual feature of human rule application: under forced time delay, human samples rely more heavily on a rule's text than on other considerations such as a rule's purpose.. Our results revealed that some models (Gemini Pro and Claude 3) responded in a human-like manner to a prompt describing either forced delay or time pressure, while others (GPT-4o and Llama 3.2 90b) did not. We argue that the evidence gathered suggests that LLMs have mastery over the concept of rule, with implications for both legal decision making and philosophical inquiry.</description>

      <title>An Exact Solver for Satisfiability Modulo Counting with Probabilistic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Counting (SMC) is a recently proposed general language to reason about problems integrating statistical and symbolic artificial intelligence. An SMC formula is an extended SAT formula in which the truth values of a few Boolean variables are determined by probabilistic inference. Existing approximate solvers optimize surrogate objectives, which lack formal guarantees. Current exact solvers directly integrate SAT solvers and probabilistic inference solvers resulting in slow performance because of many back-and-forth invocations of both solvers. We propose KOCO-SMC, an integrated exact SMC solver that efficiently tracks lower and upper bounds in the probabilistic inference process. It enhances computational efficiency by enabling early estimation of probabilistic inference using only partial variable assignments, whereas existing methods require full variable assignments. In the experiment, we compare KOCO-SMC with currently available approximate and exact SMC solvers on large-scale datasets and real-world applications. Our approach delivers high-quality solutions with high efficiency.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Long-Term Performance Objectives for Service Workforce Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Workforce optimization plays a crucial role in efficient organizational operations where decision-making may span several different administrative and time scales. For instance, dispatching personnel to immediate service requests while managing talent acquisition with various expertise sets up a highly dynamic optimization problem. Existing work focuses on specific sub-problems such as resource allocation and facility location, which are solved with heuristics like local-search and, more recently, deep reinforcement learning. However, these may not accurately represent real-world scenarios where such sub-problems are not fully independent. Our aim is to fill this gap by creating a simulator that models a unified workforce optimization problem. Specifically, we designed a modular simulator to support the development of reinforcement learning methods for integrated workforce optimization problems. We focus on three interdependent aspects: personnel dispatch, workforce management, and personnel positioning. The simulator provides configurable parameterizations to help explore dynamic scenarios with varying levels of stochasticity and non-stationarity. To facilitate benchmarking and ablation studies, we also include heuristic and RL baselines for the above mentioned aspects.</description>

      <title>FAIR: Facilitating Artificial Intelligence Resilience in Manufacturing Industrial Internet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been increasingly adopted in the Manufacturing Industrial Internet (MII). Investigating and enabling the AI resilience is very important to alleviate profound impact of AI system failures in manufacturing and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) operations, leading to critical decision making. However, there is a wide knowledge gap in defining the resilience of AI systems and analyzing potential root causes and corresponding mitigation strategies. In this work, we propose a novel framework for investigating the resilience of AI performance over time under hazard factors in data quality, AI pipelines, and the cyber-physical layer. The proposed method can facilitate effective diagnosis and mitigation strategies to recover AI performance based on a multimodal multi-head self latent attention model. The merits of the proposed method are elaborated using an MII testbed of connected Aerosol Jet Printing (AJP) machines, fog nodes, and Cloud with inference tasks via AI pipelines.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Metaheuristic Vehicle Routing Problem for Security Dispatch Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimization of the Vehicle Routing Problem for Security Dispatch (VRPSD). VRPSD focuses on security and patrolling applications which involve challenging constraints including precise timing and strict time windows. We propose three algorithms based on different metaheuristics, which are Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS), Tabu Search (TS), and Threshold Accepting (TA). The first algorithm combines single-phase ALNS with TA, the second employs a multiphase ALNS with TA, and the third integrates multiphase ALNS, TS, and TA. Experiments are conducted on an instance comprising 251 customer requests. The results demonstrate that the third algorithm, the hybrid multiphase ALNS-TS-TA algorithm, delivers the best performance. This approach simultaneously leverages the large-area search capabilities of ALNS for exploration and effectively escapes local optima when the multiphase ALNS is coupled with TS and TA. Furthermore, in our experiments, the hybrid multiphase ALNS-TS-TA algorithm is the only one that shows potential for improving results with increased computation time across all attempts.</description>

      <title>Constrained multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization with automatic stop condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is increasingly employed in critical applications to find the optimal design with minimal cost. While BO is known for its sample efficiency, relying solely on costly high-fidelity data can still result in high costs. This is especially the case in constrained search spaces where BO must not only optimize but also ensure feasibility. A related issue in the BO literature is the lack of a systematic stopping criterion. To solve these challenges, we develop a constrained cost-aware multi-fidelity BO (CMFBO) framework whose goal is to minimize overall sampling costs by utilizing inexpensive low-fidelity sources while ensuring feasibility. In our case, the constraints can change across the data sources and may be even black-box functions. We also introduce a systematic stopping criterion that addresses the long-lasting issue associated with BO's convergence assessment. Our framework is publicly available on GitHub through the GP+ Python package and herein we validate it's efficacy on multiple benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Help Experimental Design for Causal Discovery?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing proper experiments and selecting optimal intervention targets is a longstanding problem in scientific or causal discovery. Identifying the underlying causal structure from observational data alone is inherently difficult.Obtaining interventional data, on the other hand, is crucial to causal discovery, yet it is usually expensive and time-consuming to gather sufficient interventional data to facilitate causal discovery.Previous approaches commonly utilize uncertainty or gradient signals to determine the intervention targets. However, numerical-based approaches may yield suboptimal results due to the inaccurate estimation of the guiding signals at the beginning when with limited interventional data. In this work, we investigate a different approach, whether we can leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist with the intervention targeting in causal discovery by making use of the rich world knowledge about the experimental design in LLMs.Specifically, we present \oursfull (\ours) -- a robust framework that effectively incorporates LLMs to augment existing numerical approaches for the intervention targeting in causal discovery. Across $4$ realistic benchmark scales, \ours demonstrates significant improvements and robustness over existing methods and even surpasses humans, which demonstrates the usefulness of LLMs in assisting with experimental design for scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Bandit-Based Prompt Design Strategy Selection Improves Prompt Optimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt optimization aims to search for effective prompts that enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs). Although existing prompt optimization methods have discovered effective prompts, they often differ from sophisticated prompts carefully designed by human experts. Prompt design strategies, representing best practices for improving prompt performance, can be key to improving prompt optimization. Recently, a method termed the Autonomous Prompt Engineering Toolbox (APET) has incorporated various prompt design strategies into the prompt optimization process. In APET, the LLM is needed to implicitly select and apply the appropriate strategies because prompt design strategies can have negative effects. This implicit selection may be suboptimal due to the limited optimization capabilities of LLMs. This paper introduces Optimizing Prompts with sTrategy Selection (OPTS), which implements explicit selection mechanisms for prompt design. We propose three mechanisms, including a Thompson sampling-based approach, and integrate them into EvoPrompt, a well-known prompt optimizer. Experiments optimizing prompts for two LLMs, Llama-3-8B-Instruct and GPT-4o mini, were conducted using BIG-Bench Hard. Our results show that the selection of prompt design strategies improves the performance of EvoPrompt, and the Thompson sampling-based mechanism achieves the best overall results.

      <title>Prognostics and Health Management of Wafer Chemical-Mechanical Polishing System using Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Prognostics and Health Management Data Challenge (PHM) 2016 tracks the health state of components of a semiconductor wafer polishing process. The ultimate goal is to develop an ability to predict the measurement on the wafer surface wear through monitoring the components health state. This translates to cost saving in large scale production. The PHM dataset contains many time series measurements not utilized by traditional physics based approach. On the other hand task, applying a data driven approach such as deep learning to the PHM dataset is non-trivial. The main issue with supervised deep learning is that class label is not available to the PHM dataset. Second, the feature space trained by an unsupervised deep learner is not specifically targeted at the predictive ability or regression. In this work, we propose using the autoencoder based clustering whereby the feature space trained is found to be more suitable for performing regression. This is due to having a more compact distribution of samples respective to their nearest cluster means. We justify our claims by comparing the performance of our proposed method on the PHM dataset with several baselines such as the autoencoder as well as state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>OptMetaOpenFOAM: Large Language Model Driven Chain of Thought for Sensitivity Analysis and Parameter Optimization based on CFD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Merging natural language interfaces with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) workflows presents transformative opportunities for both industry and research. In this study, we introduce OptMetaOpenFOAM - a novel framework that bridges MetaOpenFOAM with external analysis and optimization tool libraries through a large language model (LLM)-driven chain-of-thought (COT) methodology. By automating complex CFD tasks via natural language inputs, the framework empowers non-expert users to perform sensitivity analyses and parameter optimizations with markedly improved efficiency. The test dataset comprises 11 distinct CFD analysis or optimization tasks, including a baseline simulation task derived from an OpenFOAM tutorial covering fluid dynamics, combustion, and heat transfer. Results confirm that OptMetaOpenFOAM can accurately interpret user requirements expressed in natural language and effectively invoke external tool libraries alongside MetaOpenFOAM to complete the tasks. Furthermore, validation on a non-OpenFOAM tutorial case - namely, a hydrogen combustion chamber - demonstrates that a mere 200-character natural language input can trigger a sequence of simulation, postprocessing, analysis, and optimization tasks spanning over 2,000 lines of code. These findings underscore the transformative potential of LLM-driven COT methodologies in linking external tool for advanced analysis and optimization, positioning OptMetaOpenFOAM as an effective tool that streamlines CFD simulations and enhances their convenience and efficiency for both industrial and research applications.

      <title>Learning Conjecturing from Scratch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a self-learning approach for conjecturing of induction predicates on a dataset of 16197 problems derived from the OEIS. These problems are hard for today's SMT and ATP systems because they require a combination of inductive and arithmetical reasoning.
  Starting from scratch, our approach consists of a feedback loop that iterates between (i) training a neural translator to learn the correspondence between the problems solved so far and the induction predicates useful for them, (ii) using the trained neural system to generate many new induction predicates for the problems, (iii) fast runs of the z3 prover attempting to prove the problems using the generated predicates, (iv) using heuristics such as predicate size and solution speed on the proved problems to choose the best predicates for the next iteration of training.
  The algorithm discovers on its own many interesting induction predicates, ultimately solving 5565 problems, compared to 2265 problems solved by CVC5, Vampire or Z3 in 60 seconds.</description>

      <title>Building Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Membership Function: A Deck of Cards based Co-constructive Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its inception, Fuzzy Set has been widely used to handle uncertainty and imprecision in decision-making. However, conventional fuzzy sets, often referred to as type-1 fuzzy sets (T1FSs) have limitations in capturing higher levels of uncertainty, particularly when decision-makers (DMs) express hesitation or ambiguity in membership degree. To address this, Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets (IT2FSs) have been introduced by incorporating uncertainty in membership degree allocation, which enhanced flexibility in modelling subjective judgments. Despite their advantages, existing IT2FS construction methods often lack active involvement from DMs and that limits the interpretability and effectiveness of decision models. This study proposes a socio-technical co-constructive approach for developing IT2FS models of linguistic terms by facilitating the active involvement of DMs in preference elicitation and its application in multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. Our methodology is structured in two phases. The first phase involves an interactive process between the DM and the decision analyst, in which a modified version of Deck-of-Cards (DoC) method is proposed to construct T1FS membership functions on a ratio scale. We then extend this method to incorporate ambiguity in subjective judgment and that resulted in an IT2FS model that better captures uncertainty in DM's linguistic assessments. The second phase formalizes the constructed IT2FS model for application in MCDM by defining an appropriate mathematical representation of such information, aggregation rules, and an admissible ordering principle. The proposed framework enhances the reliability and effectiveness of fuzzy decision-making not only by accurately representing DM's personalized semantics of linguistic information.</description>

      <title>From Hypothesis to Publication: A Comprehensive Survey of AI-Driven Research Support Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research is a fundamental process driving the advancement of human civilization, yet it demands substantial time and effort from researchers. In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has inspired researchers to explore how AI can accelerate and enhance research. To monitor relevant advancements, this paper presents a systematic review of the progress in this domain. Specifically, we organize the relevant studies into three main categories: hypothesis formulation, hypothesis validation, and manuscript publication. Hypothesis formulation involves knowledge synthesis and hypothesis generation. Hypothesis validation includes the verification of scientific claims, theorem proving, and experiment validation. Manuscript publication encompasses manuscript writing and the peer review process. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the current challenges faced in these areas, as well as potential future directions for research. Finally, we also offer a comprehensive overview of existing benchmarks and tools across various domains that support the integration of AI into the research process. We hope this paper serves as an introduction for beginners and fosters future research. Resources have been made publicly available at https://github.com/zkzhou126/AI-for-Research.</description>

      <title>SrSv: Integrating Sequential Rollouts with Sequential Value Estimation for Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown its success across diverse domains, extending its application to large-scale real-world systems still faces significant challenges. Primarily, the high complexity of real-world environments exacerbates the credit assignment problem, substantially reducing training efficiency. Moreover, the variability of agent populations in large-scale scenarios necessitates scalable decision-making mechanisms. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework: Sequential rollout with Sequential value estimation (SrSv). This framework aims to capture agent interdependence and provide a scalable solution for cooperative MARL. Specifically, SrSv leverages the autoregressive property of the Transformer model to handle varying populations through sequential action rollout. Furthermore, to capture the interdependence of policy distributions and value functions among multiple agents, we introduce an innovative sequential value estimation methodology and integrates the value approximation into an attention-based sequential model. We evaluate SrSv on three benchmarks: Multi-Agent MuJoCo, StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, and DubinsCars. Experimental results demonstrate that SrSv significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of training efficiency without compromising convergence performance. Moreover, when implemented in a large-scale DubinsCar system with 1,024 agents, our framework surpasses existing benchmarks, highlighting the excellent scalability of SrSv.</description>

      <title>ProRCA: A Causal Python Package for Actionable Root Cause Analysis in Real-world Business Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is becoming ever more critical as modern systems grow in complexity, volume of data, and interdependencies. While traditional RCA methods frequently rely on correlation-based or rule-based techniques, these approaches can prove inadequate in highly dynamic, multi-layered environments. In this paper, we present a pathway-tracing package built on the DoWhy causal inference library. Our method integrates conditional anomaly scoring, noise-based attribution, and depth-first path exploration to reveal multi-hop causal chains. By systematically tracing entire causal pathways from an observed anomaly back to the initial triggers, our approach provides a comprehensive, end-to-end RCA solution. Experimental evaluations with synthetic anomaly injections demonstrate the package's ability to accurately isolate triggers and rank root causes by their overall significance.</description>

      <title>Enabling AI Scientists to Recognize Innovation: A Domain-Agnostic Algorithm for Assessing Novelty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), automating the generation and evaluation of novel research ideas is a key challenge in AI-driven scientific discovery. This paper presents Relative Neighbor Density (RND), a domain-agnostic algorithm for novelty assessment in research ideas that overcomes the limitations of existing approaches by analyzing the distribution patterns of semantic neighbors rather than simple distances. We first developed a scalable methodology to create validation datasets without expert labeling, addressing a fundamental challenge in novelty assessment. Using these datasets, we demonstrate that our RND algorithm achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in computer science (AUROC=0.808) and biomedical research (AUROC=0.757) domains. Most significantly, while SOTA models like Sonnet-3.7 and existing metrics show domain-specific performance degradation, RND maintains consistent effectiveness across domains, outperforming all benchmarks by a substantial margin (0.782 v.s. 0.597) on cross-domain evaluation. These results validate RND as a generalizable solution for automated novelty assessment in scientific research.</description>

      <title>SENSEI: Semantic Exploration Guided by Foundation Models to Learn Versatile World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploration is a cornerstone of reinforcement learning (RL). Intrinsic motivation attempts to decouple exploration from external, task-based rewards. However, established approaches to intrinsic motivation that follow general principles such as information gain, often only uncover low-level interactions. In contrast, children's play suggests that they engage in meaningful high-level behavior by imitating or interacting with their caregivers. Recent work has focused on using foundation models to inject these semantic biases into exploration. However, these methods often rely on unrealistic assumptions, such as language-embedded environments or access to high-level actions. We propose SEmaNtically Sensible ExploratIon (SENSEI), a framework to equip model-based RL agents with an intrinsic motivation for semantically meaningful behavior. SENSEI distills a reward signal of interestingness from Vision Language Model (VLM) annotations, enabling an agent to predict these rewards through a world model. Using model-based RL, SENSEI trains an exploration policy that jointly maximizes semantic rewards and uncertainty. We show that in both robotic and video game-like simulations SENSEI discovers a variety of meaningful behaviors from image observations and low-level actions. SENSEI provides a general tool for learning from foundation model feedback, a crucial research direction, as VLMs become more powerful.</description>

      <title>CoT-VLM4Tar: Chain-of-Thought Guided Vision-Language Models for Traffic Anomaly Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, modern urban traffic systems are becoming increasingly complex, leading to frequent traffic anomalies. These anomalies encompass not only common traffic jams but also more challenging issues such as phantom traffic jams, intersection deadlocks, and accident liability analysis, which severely impact traffic flow, vehicular safety, and overall transportation efficiency. Currently, existing solutions primarily rely on manual intervention by traffic police or artificial intelligence-based detection systems. However, these methods often suffer from response delays and inconsistent management due to inadequate resources, while AI detection systems, despite enhancing efficiency to some extent, still struggle to handle complex traffic anomalies in a real-time and precise manner. To address these issues, we propose CoT-VLM4Tar: (Chain of Thought Visual-Language Model for Traffic Anomaly Resolution), this innovative approach introduces a new chain-of-thought to guide the VLM in analyzing, reasoning, and generating solutions for traffic anomalies with greater reasonable and effective solution, and to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our method, we developed a closed-loop testing framework based on the CARLA simulator. Furthermore, to ensure seamless integration of the solutions generated by the VLM with the CARLA simulator, we implement an itegration module that converts these solutions into executable commands. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of VLM in the resolution of real-time traffic anomalies, providing a proof-of-concept for its integration into autonomous traffic management systems.</description>

      <title>Graph-Augmented Reasoning: Evolving Step-by-Step Knowledge Graph Retrieval for LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) reasoning, despite its success, suffers from limited domain knowledge, susceptibility to hallucinations, and constrained reasoning depth, particularly in small-scale models deployed in resource-constrained environments. This paper presents the first investigation into integrating step-wise knowledge graph retrieval with step-wise reasoning to address these challenges, introducing a novel paradigm termed as graph-augmented reasoning. Our goal is to enable frozen, small-scale LLMs to retrieve and process relevant mathematical knowledge in a step-wise manner, enhancing their problem-solving abilities without additional training. To this end, we propose KG-RAR, a framework centered on process-oriented knowledge graph construction, a hierarchical retrieval strategy, and a universal post-retrieval processing and reward model (PRP-RM) that refines retrieved information and evaluates each reasoning step. Experiments on the Math500 and GSM8K benchmarks across six models demonstrate that KG-RAR yields encouraging results, achieving a 20.73\% relative improvement with Llama-3B on Math500.</description>

      <title>Learning Exposure Mapping Functions for Inferring Heterogeneous Peer Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In causal inference, interference refers to the phenomenon in which the actions of peers in a network can influence an individual's outcome. Peer effect refers to the difference in counterfactual outcomes of an individual for different levels of peer exposure, the extent to which an individual is exposed to the treatments, actions, or behaviors of peers. Estimating peer effects requires deciding how to represent peer exposure. Typically, researchers define an exposure mapping function that aggregates peer treatments and outputs peer exposure. Most existing approaches for defining exposure mapping functions assume peer exposure based on the number or fraction of treated peers. Recent studies have investigated more complex functions of peer exposure which capture that different peers can exert different degrees of influence. However, none of these works have explicitly considered the problem of automatically learning the exposure mapping function. In this work, we focus on learning this function for the purpose of estimating heterogeneous peer effects, where heterogeneity refers to the variation in counterfactual outcomes for the same peer exposure but different individual's contexts. We develop EgoNetGNN, a graph neural network (GNN)-based method, to automatically learn the appropriate exposure mapping function allowing for complex peer influence mechanisms that, in addition to peer treatments, can involve the local neighborhood structure and edge attributes. We show that GNN models that use peer exposure based on the number or fraction of treated peers or learn peer exposure naively face difficulty accounting for such influence mechanisms. Our comprehensive evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network data shows that our method is more robust to different unknown underlying influence mechanisms when estimating heterogeneous peer effects when compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Position: Don't use the CLT in LLM evals with fewer than a few hundred datapoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rigorous statistical evaluations of large language models (LLMs), including valid error bars and significance testing, are essential for meaningful and reliable performance assessment. Currently, when such statistical measures are reported, they typically rely on the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). In this position paper, we argue that while CLT-based methods for uncertainty quantification are appropriate when benchmarks consist of thousands of examples, they fail to provide adequate uncertainty estimates for LLM evaluations that rely on smaller, highly specialized benchmarks. In these small-data settings, we demonstrate that CLT-based methods perform very poorly, usually dramatically underestimating uncertainty (i.e. producing error bars that are too small). We give recommendations for alternative frequentist and Bayesian methods that are both easy to implement and more appropriate in these increasingly common scenarios. We provide a simple Python library for these Bayesian methods at https://github.com/sambowyer/bayes_evals .</description>

      <title>SAKE: Steering Activations for Knowledge Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Langue Models have been shown to memorize real-world facts, the need to update this knowledge in a controlled and efficient manner arises. Designed with these constraints in mind, Knowledge Editing (KE) approaches propose to alter specific facts in pretrained models. However, they have been shown to suffer from several limitations, including their lack of contextual robustness and their failure to generalize to logical implications related to the fact. To overcome these issues, we propose SAKE, a steering activation method that models a fact to be edited as a distribution rather than a single prompt. Leveraging Optimal Transport, SAKE alters the LLM behavior over a whole fact-related distribution, defined as paraphrases and logical implications. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method: SAKE is thus able to perform more robust edits than its existing counterparts.</description>

      <title>Generating Counterfactual Explanations Under Temporal Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations are one of the prominent eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, and suggest changes to input data that could alter predictions, leading to more favourable outcomes. Existing counterfactual methods do not readily apply to temporal domains, such as that of process mining, where data take the form of traces of activities that must obey to temporal background knowledge expressing which dynamics are possible and which not. Specifically, counterfactuals generated off-the-shelf may violate the background knowledge, leading to inconsistent explanations. This work tackles this challenge by introducing a novel approach for generating temporally constrained counterfactuals, guaranteed to comply by design with background knowledge expressed in Linear Temporal Logic on process traces (LTLp). We do so by infusing automata-theoretic techniques for LTLp inside a genetic algorithm for counterfactual generation. The empirical evaluation shows that the generated counterfactuals are temporally meaningful and more interpretable for applications involving temporal dependencies.</description>

      <title>Do GFlowNets Transfer? Case Study on the Game of 24/42</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating diverse solutions is key to human-like reasoning, yet autoregressive language models focus on single accurate responses, limiting creativity. GFlowNets optimize solution generation as a flow network, promising greater diversity. Our case study shows their limited zero-shot transferability by fine-tuning small and medium-sized large language models on the Game of 24 and testing them on the Game of 42 datasets. Results revealed that GFlowNets struggle to maintain solution diversity and accuracy, highlighting key limitations in their cross-task generalization and the need for future research in improved transfer learning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Eeyore: Realistic Depression Simulation via Supervised and Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been previously explored for mental healthcare training and therapy client simulation, but they still fall short in authentically capturing diverse client traits and psychological conditions. We introduce \textbf{Eeyore}, an 8B model optimized for realistic depression simulation through a structured alignment framework, incorporating expert input at every stage. First, we systematically curate real-world depression-related conversations, extracting depressive traits to guide data filtering and psychological profile construction, and use this dataset to instruction-tune Eeyore for profile adherence. Next, to further enhance realism, Eeyore undergoes iterative preference optimization -- first leveraging model-generated preferences and then calibrating with a small set of expert-annotated preferences. Throughout the entire pipeline, we actively collaborate with domain experts, developing interactive interfaces to validate trait extraction and iteratively refine structured psychological profiles for clinically meaningful role-play customization. Despite its smaller model size, the Eeyore depression simulation outperforms GPT-4o with SOTA prompting strategies, both in linguistic authenticity and profile adherence.</description>

      <title>KVCrush: Key value cache size-reduction using similarity in head-behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Key-value (KV) caching has emerged as a crucial optimization technique for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs). By allowing the attention operation to scale linearly rather than quadratically with the total sequence length, KV caching significantly enhances generation throughput. However, due to large context lengths in the modern LLMs, the memory footprint of the KV is a huge bottleneck for model deployment directly impacting the model's batch size, hindering its ability to deliver high-throughput. Existing research addresses this challenge using several techniques, such as discarding low-attention tokens, quantization, and matrix approximation which typically lead to a negative impact on the model accuracy.
  In this paper, We propose KVCrush technology which can be combined with many KV compression technologies to improve the model accuracy at a much smaller memory. KVCrush provides an alternate representation scheme for key-value states, along with a low-overhead token pruning algorithm that accounts for the token distribution in the KV cache, which in turn allows for a a smaller footprint while maintaining the accuracy of the model. Based on our results, KVCrush reduces LongBench KV Cache size by 4x with less than 1% accuracy drop and achieves state-of-the-art average accuracy with minimal overhead, incurring less than 0.5% total inference latency. KVCrush not only outperforms the accuracy of state-of-the-art importance-based token retention schemes but is also compatible with typical practical LLM deployments using KV cache paging schemes such as vLLM and mixed precision quantization.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models on the Spanish Medical Intern Resident (MIR) Examination 2024/2025:A Comparative Analysis of Clinical Reasoning and Knowledge Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comparative evaluation of 22 large language models LLMs on the Spanish Medical Intern Resident MIR examinations for 2024 and 2025 with a focus on clinical reasoning domain specific expertise and multimodal processing capabilities The MIR exam consisting of 210 multiple choice questions some requiring image interpretation serves as a stringent benchmark for assessing both factual recall and complex clinical problem solving skills Our investigation encompasses general purpose models such as GPT4 Claude LLaMA and Gemini as well as specialized fine tuned systems like Miri Pro which leverages proprietary Spanish healthcare data to excel in medical contexts
  Recent market entries Deepseek and Grok have further enriched the evaluation landscape particularly for tasks that demand advanced visual and semantic analysis The findings indicate that while general purpose LLMs perform robustly overall fine tuned models consistently achieve superior accuracy especially in addressing nuanced domain specific challenges A modest performance decline observed between the two exam cycles appears attributable to the implementation of modified questions designed to mitigate reliance on memorization
  The results underscore the transformative potential of domain specific fine tuning and multimodal integration in advancing medical AI applications They also highlight critical implications for the future integration of LLMs into medical education training and clinical decision making emphasizing the importance of balancing automated reasoning with ethical and context aware judgment</description>

      <title>Genetics-Driven Personalized Disease Progression Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling disease progression through multiple stages is critical for clinical decision-making for chronic diseases, e.g., cancer, diabetes, chronic kidney diseases, and so on. Existing approaches often model the disease progression as a uniform trajectory pattern at the population level. However, chronic diseases are highly heterogeneous and often have multiple progression patterns depending on a patient's individual genetics and environmental effects due to lifestyles. We propose a personalized disease progression model to jointly learn the heterogeneous progression patterns and groups of genetic profiles. In particular, an end-to-end pipeline is designed to simultaneously infer the characteristics of patients from genetic markers using a variational autoencoder and how it drives the disease progressions using an RNN-based state-space model based on clinical observations. Our proposed model shows improvement on real-world and synthetic clinical data.</description>

      <title>Streaming Looking Ahead with Token-level Self-reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive decoding algorithms that use only past information often cannot guarantee the best performance. Recently, people discovered that looking-ahead algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with external reward models (RMs) can significantly improve models' output by allowing them to think ahead and leverage future outputs and associated rewards to guide the current generation. Such techniques can help the reinforcement fine-tuning phase by sampling better trajectories and the inference phase by selecting the better output. However, their high computational cost limits their applications, especially in streaming scenarios. To address this issue, we propose equipping the policy model with token-level self-reward modeling (TRM) capability to eliminate the need for external models and extra communication. We name the new architecture as Reward Transformer. In addition, we propose a streaming-looking-ahead (SLA) algorithm to further boost search efficiency with better parallelization. Experiments show that SLA achieves an overall win rate of 79.7\% against the baseline greedy decoding algorithm on three general-domain datasets with a frozen policy model while maintaining streaming efficiency. If we combine SLA with reinforcement fine-tuning techniques such as DPO, SLA achieves an overall win rate of 89.4\%.</description>

      <title>Game-Theoretic Regularized Self-Play Alignment of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-play alignment algorithms have been developed as effective methods for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), formulating preference optimization as a two-player game. However, the regularization with respect to the reference policy, which is crucial for mitigating over-optimization, has been insufficiently investigated in self-play alignment. In this paper, we show that our regularization method can improve the unregularized self-play significantly. To study the impact of different regularizations in self-play alignment, we propose Regularized Self-Play Policy Optimization (RSPO). This generalized framework regularizes the self-play by simply adding a chosen regularization term into the loss while maintaining provable last-iterate convergence to the Nash Equilibrium of the corresponding regularized game. Surprisingly, empirical evaluations using the Mistral-7B-Instruct base model reveal that forward KL divergence regularization reduces response length in RSPO, whereas reverse KL divergence markedly improves raw win rates. RSPO with a linear combination of forward and reverse KL divergence regularization substantially increases the length-controlled win rate in AlpacaEval-2, elevating the unregularized self-play alignment method (SPPO) from $28.53\%$ to $35.44\%$. Finally, we show that RSPO also improves the response diversity.</description>

      <title>Efficient Test-Time Scaling via Self-Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasing test-time computation is a straightforward approach to enhancing the quality of responses in Large Language Models (LLMs). While Best-of-N sampling and Self-Consistency with majority voting are simple and effective, they require a fixed number of sampling responses for each query, regardless of its complexity. This could result in wasted computation for simpler questions and insufficient exploration for more challenging ones. In this work, we argue that model confidence of responses can be used for improving the efficiency of test-time scaling. Unfortunately, LLMs are known to be overconfident and provide unreliable confidence estimation. To address this limitation, we introduce Self-Calibration by distilling Self-Consistency-derived confidence into the model itself. This enables reliable confidence estimation at test time with one forward pass. We then design confidence-based efficient test-time scaling methods to handle queries of various difficulty, such as Early-Stopping for Best-of-N and Self-Consistency with calibrated confidence. Experiments on three LLMs across six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, applying confidence-based Early Stopping to Best-of-N improves MathQA accuracy from 81.0 to 83.6 with a sample budget of 16 responses, indicating the efficacy of confidence-based sampling strategy at inference time.</description>

      <title>Detecting LLM-Generated Korean Text through Linguistic Feature Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) increases the difficulty of distinguishing between human-written and LLM-generated text. Detecting LLM-generated text is crucial for upholding academic integrity, preventing plagiarism, protecting copyrights, and ensuring ethical research practices. Most prior studies on detecting LLM-generated text focus primarily on English text. However, languages with distinct morphological and syntactic characteristics require specialized detection approaches. Their unique structures and usage patterns can hinder the direct application of methods primarily designed for English. Among such languages, we focus on Korean, which has relatively flexible spacing rules, a rich morphological system, and less frequent comma usage compared to English. We introduce KatFish, the first benchmark dataset for detecting LLM-generated Korean text. The dataset consists of text written by humans and generated by four LLMs across three genres.
  By examining spacing patterns, part-of-speech diversity, and comma usage, we illuminate the linguistic differences between human-written and LLM-generated Korean text. Building on these observations, we propose KatFishNet, a detection method specifically designed for the Korean language. KatFishNet achieves an average of 19.78% higher AUROC compared to the best-performing existing detection method.</description>

      <title>MergeIT: From Selection to Merging for Efficient Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs), yet mainstream data selection methods heavily rely on LLMs as instruction quality scorers, leading to high computational costs and reduced data diversity. To address these limitations, we propose MergeIT, a novel LLM-based Merging strategy for better Instruction Tuning that shifts the focus from selection to synthesis. MergeIT operates in two stages: first, topic-aware filtering clusters and refines the dataset, preserving diversity while eliminating redundancy without relying on LLM-based scoring. Second, LLM-based merging synthesizes semantically similar instructions into more informative and compact training data, enhancing data richness while further reducing dataset size. Experimental results demonstrate that MergeIT enables efficient, diverse, and scalable instruction selection and synthesis, establishing LLM-based merging as a promising alternative to conventional scoring-based selection methods for instruction tuning.

      <title>Constraining Sequential Model Editing with Editing Anchor Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with hallucinations due to false or outdated knowledge. Given the high resource demands of retraining these models, there is an increasing focus on developing model editing. However, the general abilities of LLMs across downstream tasks are prone to significant degradation during sequential editing. This paper statistically observes that the parameter matrix after editing exhibits a significant deviation compared to its previous state as the number of edits increases. This serious deviation affects the original knowledge associations within LLMs and leads to the degradation of their general abilities. To this end, a framework termed Editing Anchor Compression (EAC) is proposed to constrain the deviation of the parameter matrix during sequential editing. It compresses the editing information by selecting editing anchors that are important in encoding new relations without deviating too much from the original matrix, thereby preserving the general abilities. Experiments of applying EAC to two popular editing methods on three LLMs across four tasks are conducted. Evaluation results show that EAC effectively minimizes unreasonable deviations caused by model editing, preserving over 70% of the general abilities while better retaining the editing knowledge compared to the original counterpart methods.</description>

      <title>A Novel Spatiotemporal Correlation Anomaly Detection Method Based on Time-Frequency-Domain Feature Fusion and a Dynamic Graph Neural Network in Wireless Sensor Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention-based transformers have played an important role in wireless sensor network (WSN) timing anomaly detection due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies. However, there are several issues that must be addressed, such as the fact that their ability to capture long-term dependencies is not completely reliable, their computational complexity levels are high, and the spatiotemporal features of WSN timing data are not sufficiently extracted for detecting the correlation anomalies of multinode WSN timing data. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a WSN anomaly detection method that integrates frequency-domain features with dynamic graph neural networks (GNN) under a designed self-encoder reconstruction framework. First, the discrete wavelet transform effectively decomposes trend and seasonal components of time series to solve the poor long-term reliability of transformers. Second, a frequency-domain attention mechanism is designed to make full use of the difference between the amplitude distributions of normal data and anomalous data in this domain. Finally, a multimodal fusion-based dynamic graph convolutional network (MFDGCN) is designed by combining an attention mechanism and a graph convolutional network (GCN) to adaptively extract spatial correlation features. A series of experiments conducted on public datasets and their results demonstrate that the anomaly detection method designed in this paper exhibits superior precision and recall than the existing methods do, with an F1 score of 93.5%, representing an improvement of 2.9% over that of the existing models.</description>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant strides in multimodal comprehension, thanks to extensive pre-training and fine-tuning on large-scale visual datasets. However, despite their robust textual safety mechanisms, they remain vulnerable to harmful visual inputs. Existing safeguards-typically relying on pre-filtering or fine-tuning-incur high costs and diminish overall utility. To address this critical vulnerability, we introduce SafeCLIP, a lightweight method that leverages LVLMs inherent multimodal alignment for zero-shot toxic image detection. By projecting CLIPs discarded CLS token into its text space and matching it with toxic descriptors, SafeCLIP detects harmful content without any architectural changes-adding minimal latency and enabling dynamic safety corrections during inference and fine-tuning.Experiments show that SafeCLIP achieves a 66.9% defense success rate with only 3.2% false positive rate and 7.2% overhead. In contrast, state-of-the-art methods achieve 52.9% success but have a 10.7% false positive rate and 210% overhead. Our work demonstrates that leveraging inherent multimodal alignment can yield efficient, low-cost LVLM safety. Code is available at anonymous.4open.science/r/safeclip-2C01.</description>

      <title>from Benign import Toxic: Jailbreaking the Language Model via Adversarial Metaphors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current studies have exposed the risk of Large Language Models (LLMs) generating harmful content by jailbreak attacks. However, they overlook that the direct generation of harmful content from scratch is more difficult than inducing LLM to calibrate benign content into harmful forms. In our study, we introduce a novel attack framework that exploits AdVersArial meTAphoR (AVATAR) to induce the LLM to calibrate malicious metaphors for jailbreaking. Specifically, to answer harmful queries, AVATAR adaptively identifies a set of benign but logically related metaphors as the initial seed. Then, driven by these metaphors, the target LLM is induced to reason and calibrate about the metaphorical content, thus jailbroken by either directly outputting harmful responses or calibrating residuals between metaphorical and professional harmful content. Experimental results demonstrate that AVATAR can effectively and transferable jailbreak LLMs and achieve a state-of-the-art attack success rate across multiple advanced LLMs.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Segment Anything 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) is a critical task in the development of video perception and understanding. The Segment-Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), released by Meta AI, is the current state-of-the-art architecture for end-to-end VOS. SAM 2 performs very well on both clean video data and augmented data, and completely intelligent video perception requires an understanding of how this architecture is capable of achieving such quality results. To better understand how each step within the SAM 2 architecture permits high-quality video segmentation, we pass a variety of complex video transformations through the architecture and measure the impact at each stage of the process. We observe that each progressive stage enables the filtering of complex transformation noise and the emphasis of the object of interest. Our contributions include the creation of complex transformation video datasets, an analysis of how each stage of the SAM 2 architecture interprets these transformations, and visualizations of segmented objects through each stage. By better understanding how each model structure impacts overall video understanding, VOS development can work to improve real-world applicability and performance tracking, localizing, and segmenting objects despite complex cluttered scenes and obscurations.</description>

      <title>VOILA: Evaluation of MLLMs For Perceptual Understanding and Analogical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become a powerful tool for integrating visual and textual information. Despite their exceptional performance on visual understanding benchmarks, measuring their ability to reason abstractly across multiple images remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce VOILA, a large-scale, open-ended, dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' perceptual understanding and abstract relational reasoning. VOILA employs an analogical mapping approach in the visual domain, requiring models to generate an image that completes an analogy between two given image pairs, reference and application, without relying on predefined choices. Our experiments demonstrate that the analogical reasoning tasks in VOILA present a challenge to MLLMs. Through multi-step analysis, we reveal that current MLLMs struggle to comprehend inter-image relationships and exhibit limited capabilities in high-level relational reasoning. Notably, we observe that performance improves when following a multi-step strategy of least-to-most prompting. Comprehensive evaluations on open-source models and GPT-4o show that on text-based answers, the best accuracy for challenging scenarios is 13% (LLaMa 3.2) and even for simpler tasks is only 29% (GPT-4o), while human performance is significantly higher at 70% across both difficulty levels.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Models for Evaluating Novel Content: A Case Study on Advertisement Creativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating creativity is challenging, even for humans, not only because of its subjectivity but also because it involves complex cognitive processes. Inspired by work in marketing, we attempt to break down visual advertisement creativity into atypicality and originality. With fine-grained human annotations on these dimensions, we propose a suit of tasks specifically for such a subjective problem. We also evaluate the alignment between state-of-the-art (SoTA) vision language models (VLM) and humans on our proposed benchmark, demonstrating both the promises and challenges of using VLMs for automatic creativity assessment.</description>

      <title>Omni-SILA: Towards Omni-scene Driven Visual Sentiment Identifying, Locating and Attributing in Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prior studies on Visual Sentiment Understanding (VSU) primarily rely on the explicit scene information (e.g., facial expression) to judge visual sentiments, which largely ignore implicit scene information (e.g., human action, objection relation and visual background), while such information is critical for precisely discovering visual sentiments. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a new Omni-scene driven visual Sentiment Identifying, Locating and Attributing in videos (Omni-SILA) task, aiming to interactively and precisely identify, locate and attribute visual sentiments through both explicit and implicit scene information. Furthermore, this paper believes that this Omni-SILA task faces two key challenges: modeling scene and highlighting implicit scene beyond explicit. To this end, this paper proposes an Implicit-enhanced Causal MoE (ICM) approach for addressing the Omni-SILA task. Specifically, a Scene-Balanced MoE (SBM) and an Implicit-Enhanced Causal (IEC) blocks are tailored to model scene information and highlight the implicit scene information beyond explicit, respectively. Extensive experimental results on our constructed explicit and implicit Omni-SILA datasets demonstrate the great advantage of the proposed ICM approach over advanced Video-LLMs.</description>

      <title>RURA-Net: A general disease diagnosis method based on Zero-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The training of deep learning models relies on a large amount of labeled data. However, the high cost of medical labeling seriously hinders the development of deep learning in the medical field. Our study proposes a general disease diagnosis approach based on Zero-Shot Learning. The Siamese neural network is used to find similar diseases for the target diseases, and the U-Net segmentation model is used to accurately segment the key lesions of the disease. Finally, based on the ResNet-Agglomerative clustering algorithm, a clustering model is trained on a large number of sample data of similar diseases to obtain a approximate diagnosis of the target disease. Zero-Shot Learning of the target disease is then successfully achieved. To evaluate the validity of the model, we validated our method on a dataset of ophthalmic diseases in CFP modality. The external dataset was used to test its performance, and the accuracy=0.8395, precision=0.8094, recall=0.8463, F1 Score=0.8274, AUC=0.9226, which exceeded the indexes of most Few-Shot Learning and One-Shot Learning models. It proves that our method has great potential and reference value in the medical field, where annotation data is usually scarce and expensive to obtain.</description>

      <title>AI and Semantic Communication for Infrastructure Monitoring in 6G-Driven Drone Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles to monitor critical infrastructure is gaining momentum in various industrial domains. Organizational imperatives drive this progression to minimize expenses, accelerate processes, and mitigate hazards faced by inspection personnel. However, traditional infrastructure monitoring systems face critical bottlenecks-5G networks lack the latency and reliability for large-scale drone coordination, while manual inspections remain costly and slow. We propose a 6G-enabled drone swarm system that integrates ultra-reliable, low-latency communications, edge AI, and semantic communication to automate inspections. By adopting LLMs for structured output and report generation, our framework is hypothesized to reduce inspection costs and improve fault detection speed compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the complaint aspects: Towards an aspect-based complaint identification model with video complaint dataset in finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's competitive marketing landscape, effective complaint management is crucial for customer service and business success. Video complaints, integrating text and image content, offer invaluable insights by addressing customer grievances and delineating product benefits and drawbacks. However, comprehending nuanced complaint aspects within vast daily multimodal financial data remains a formidable challenge. Addressing this gap, we have curated a proprietary multimodal video complaint dataset comprising 433 publicly accessible instances. Each instance is meticulously annotated at the utterance level, encompassing five distinct categories of financial aspects and their associated complaint labels. To support this endeavour, we introduce Solution 3.0, a model designed for multimodal aspect-based complaint identification task. Solution 3.0 is tailored to perform three key tasks: 1) handling multimodal features ( audio and video), 2) facilitating multilabel aspect classification, and 3) conducting multitasking for aspect classifications and complaint identification parallelly. Solution 3.0 utilizes a CLIP-based dual frozen encoder with an integrated image segment encoder for global feature fusion, enhanced by contextual attention (ISEC) to improve accuracy and efficiency. Our proposed framework surpasses current multimodal baselines, exhibiting superior performance across nearly all metrics by opening new ways to strengthen appropriate customer care initiatives and effectively assisting individuals in resolving their problems.</description>

      <title>African Gender Classification Using Clothing Identification Via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human attribute identification and classification are crucial in computer vision, driving the development of innovative recognition systems. Traditional gender classification methods primarily rely on facial recognition, which, while effective, struggles under non-ideal conditions such as blurriness, side views, or partial occlusions. This study explores an alternative approach by leveraging clothing identification, specifically focusing on African traditional attire, which carries culturally significant and gender-specific features.
  We use the AFRIFASHION1600 dataset, a curated collection of 1,600 images of African traditional clothing labeled into two gender classes: male and female. A deep learning model, based on a modified VGG16 architecture and trained using transfer learning, was developed for classification. Data augmentation was applied to address the challenges posed by the relatively small dataset and to mitigate overfitting. The model achieved an accuracy of 87% on the test set, demonstrating strong predictive capability despite dataset imbalances favoring female samples.
  These findings highlight the potential of clothing-based identification as a complementary technique to facial recognition for gender classification in African contexts. Future research should focus on expanding and balancing datasets to enhance classification robustness and improve the applicability of clothing-based gender recognition systems.</description>

      <title>SAC-ViT: Semantic-Aware Clustering Vision Transformer with Early Exit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) excels in global modeling but faces deployment challenges on resource-constrained devices due to the quadratic computational complexity of its attention mechanism. To address this, we propose the Semantic-Aware Clustering Vision Transformer (SAC-ViT), a non-iterative approach to enhance ViT's computational efficiency. SAC-ViT operates in two stages: Early Exit (EE) and Semantic-Aware Clustering (SAC). In the EE stage, downsampled input images are processed to extract global semantic information and generate initial inference results. If these results do not meet the EE termination criteria, the information is clustered into target and non-target tokens. In the SAC stage, target tokens are mapped back to the original image, cropped, and embedded. These target tokens are then combined with reused non-target tokens from the EE stage, and the attention mechanism is applied within each cluster. This two-stage design, with end-to-end optimization, reduces spatial redundancy and enhances computational efficiency, significantly boosting overall ViT performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of SAC-ViT, reducing 62% of the FLOPs of DeiT and achieving 1.98 times throughput without compromising performance.</description>

      <title>Societal Alignment Frameworks Can Improve LLM Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on producing responses that meet human expectations and align with shared values - a process coined alignment. However, aligning LLMs remains challenging due to the inherent disconnect between the complexity of human values and the narrow nature of the technological approaches designed to address them. Current alignment methods often lead to misspecified objectives, reflecting the broader issue of incomplete contracts, the impracticality of specifying a contract between a model developer, and the model that accounts for every scenario in LLM alignment. In this paper, we argue that improving LLM alignment requires incorporating insights from societal alignment frameworks, including social, economic, and contractual alignment, and discuss potential solutions drawn from these domains. Given the role of uncertainty within societal alignment frameworks, we then investigate how it manifests in LLM alignment. We end our discussion by offering an alternative view on LLM alignment, framing the underspecified nature of its objectives as an opportunity rather than perfect their specification. Beyond technical improvements in LLM alignment, we discuss the need for participatory alignment interface designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Throughout the history from pre-industry 4.0 to post-industry 4.0, cybersecurity at banks has undergone significant changes. Pre-industry 4.0 cyber security at banks relied on individual security methods that were highly manual and had low accuracy. When moving to post-industry 4.0, cybersecurity at banks had a major turning point with security methods that combined different technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, IoT, automating necessary processes and significantly increasing the defence layer for banks. However, along with the development of new technologies, the current challenge of cybersecurity at banks lies in scalability, high costs and resources in both money and time for R&amp;D of defence methods along with the threat of high-tech cybercriminals growing and expanding. This report goes from introducing the importance of cybersecurity at banks, analyzing their management, operational and business objectives, evaluating pre-industry 4.0 technologies used for cybersecurity at banks to assessing post-industry 4.0 technologies focusing on Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain, discussing current policies and practices and ending with discussing key advantages and challenges for 4.0 technologies and recommendations for further developing cybersecurity at banks.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Edge with the State-of-the-Art Insights into Corner Case Identification and Generation for Enhanced Autonomous Vehicle Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant development of autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies. However, despite the notable achievements of some industry players, a strong and appealing body of evidence that demonstrate AVs are actually safe is lacky, which could foster public distrust in this technology and further compromise the entire development of this industry, as well as related social impacts. To improve the safety of AVs, several techniques are proposed that use synthetic data in virtual simulation. In particular, the highest risk data, known as corner cases (CCs), are the most valuable for developing and testing AV controls, as they can expose and improve the weaknesses of these autonomous systems. In this context, the present paper presents a systematic literature review aiming to comprehensively analyze methodologies for CC identifi cation and generation, also pointing out current gaps and further implications of synthetic data for AV safety and reliability. Based on a selection criteria, 110 studies were picked from an initial sample of 1673 papers. These selected paper were mapped into multiple categories to answer eight inter-linked research questions. It concludes with the recommendation of a more integrated approach focused on safe development among all stakeholders, with active collaboration between industry, academia and regulatory bodies.</description>

      <title>AI Literacy in K-12 and Higher Education in the Wake of Generative AI: An Integrative Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even though AI literacy has emerged as a prominent education topic in the wake of generative AI, its definition remains vague. There is little consensus among researchers and practitioners on how to discuss and design AI literacy interventions. The term has been used to describe both learning activities that train undergraduate students to use ChatGPT effectively and having kindergarten children interact with social robots. This paper applies an integrative review method to examine empirical and theoretical AI literacy studies published since 2020. In synthesizing the 124 reviewed studies, three ways to conceptualize literacy-functional, critical, and indirectly beneficial-and three perspectives on AI-technical detail, tool, and sociocultural-were identified, forming a framework that reflects the spectrum of how AI literacy is approached in practice. The framework highlights the need for more specialized terms within AI literacy discourse and indicates research gaps in certain AI literacy objectives.</description>

      <title>Experiences with Content Development and Assessment Design in the Era of GenAI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has the potential to transform higher education by generating human-like content. The advancement in GenAI has revolutionised several aspects of education, especially subject and assessment design. In this era, it is crucial to design assessments that challenge students and cannot be solved using GenAI tools. This makes it necessary to update the educational content with rapidly evolving technology. The assessment plays a significant role in ensuring the students learning, as it encourages students to engage actively, leading to the achievement of learning outcomes. The paper intends to determine how effectively GenAI can design a subject, including lectures, labs and assessments, using prompts and custom-based training. This paper aims to elucidate the direction to educators so they can leverage GenAI to create subject content. Additionally, we provided our experiential learning for educators to develop content, highlighting the importance of prompts and fine-tuning to ensure output quality. It has also been observed that expert evaluation is essential for assessing the quality of GenAI-generated materials throughout the content generation process.</description>

      <title>InspireMusic: Integrating Super Resolution and Large Language Model for High-Fidelity Long-Form Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce InspireMusic, a framework integrated super resolution and large language model for high-fidelity long-form music generation. A unified framework generates high-fidelity music, songs, and audio, which incorporates an autoregressive transformer with a super-resolution flow-matching model. This framework enables the controllable generation of high-fidelity long-form music at a higher sampling rate from both text and audio prompts. Our model differs from previous approaches, as we utilize an audio tokenizer with one codebook that contains richer semantic information, thereby reducing training costs and enhancing efficiency. This combination enables us to achieve high-quality audio generation with long-form coherence of up to $8$ minutes. Then, an autoregressive transformer model based on Qwen 2.5 predicts audio tokens. Next, we employ a super-resolution flow-matching model to generate high-sampling rate audio with fine-grained details learned from an acoustic codec model. Comprehensive experiments show that the InspireMusic-1.5B-Long model has a comparable performance to recent top-tier open-source systems, including MusicGen and Stable Audio 2.0, on subjective and objective evaluations. The code and pre-trained models are released at https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/InspireMusic.</description>

      <title>Generalization of CNNs on Relational Reasoning with Bar Charts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of the generalization of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and humans on relational reasoning tasks with bar charts. We first revisit previous experiments on graphical perception and update the benchmark performance of CNNs. We then test the generalization performance of CNNs on a classic relational reasoning task: estimating bar length ratios in a bar chart, by progressively perturbing the standard visualizations. We further conduct a user study to compare the performance of CNNs and humans. Our results show that CNNs outperform humans only when the training and test data have the same visual encodings. Otherwise, they may perform worse. We also find that CNNs are sensitive to perturbations in various visual encodings, regardless of their relevance to the target bars. Yet, humans are mainly influenced by bar lengths. Our study suggests that robust relational reasoning with visualizations is challenging for CNNs. Improving CNNs' generalization performance may require training them to better recognize task-related visual properties.</description>

      <title>Protein Structure Tokenization: Benchmarking and New Recipe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the development of protein structural tokenization methods, which chunk protein 3D structures into discrete or continuous representations. Structure tokenization enables the direct application of powerful techniques like language modeling for protein structures, and large multimodal models to integrate structures with protein sequences and functional texts. Despite the progress, the capabilities and limitations of these methods remain poorly understood due to the lack of a unified evaluation framework. We first introduce StructTokenBench, a framework that comprehensively evaluates the quality and efficiency of structure tokenizers, focusing on fine-grained local substructures rather than global structures, as typical in existing benchmarks. Our evaluations reveal that no single model dominates all benchmarking perspectives. Observations of codebook under-utilization led us to develop AminoAseed, a simple yet effective strategy that enhances codebook gradient updates and optimally balances codebook size and dimension for improved tokenizer utilization and quality. Compared to the leading model ESM3, our method achieves an average of 6.31% performance improvement across 24 supervised tasks, with sensitivity and utilization rates increased by 12.83% and 124.03%, respectively.</description>

      <title>EdgeAIGuard: Agentic LLMs for Minor Protection in Digital Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media has become integral to minors' daily lives and is used for various purposes, such as making friends, exploring shared interests, and engaging in educational activities. However, the increase in screen time has also led to heightened challenges, including cyberbullying, online grooming, and exploitations posed by malicious actors. Traditional content moderation techniques have proven ineffective against exploiters' evolving tactics. To address these growing challenges, we propose the EdgeAIGuard content moderation approach that is designed to protect minors from online grooming and various forms of digital exploitation. The proposed method comprises a multi-agent architecture deployed strategically at the network edge to enable rapid detection with low latency and prevent harmful content targeting minors. The experimental results show the proposed method is significantly more effective than the existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Rethinking LLM Bias Probing Using Lessons from the Social Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of LLM bias probes introduces three significant challenges: (1) we lack principled criteria for choosing appropriate probes, (2) we lack a system for reconciling conflicting results across probes, and (3) we lack formal frameworks for reasoning about when (and why) probe results will generalize to real user behavior. We address these challenges by systematizing LLM social bias probing using actionable insights from social sciences. We then introduce EcoLevels - a framework that helps (a) determine appropriate bias probes, (b) reconcile conflicting findings across probes, and (c) generate predictions about bias generalization. Overall, we ground our analysis in social science research because many LLM probes are direct applications of human probes, and these fields have faced similar challenges when studying social bias in humans. Based on our work, we suggest how the next generation of LLM bias probing can (and should) benefit from decades of social science research.</description>

      <title>BixBench: a Comprehensive Benchmark for LLM-based Agents in Computational Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents show great promise in accelerating scientific research. Existing benchmarks for measuring this potential and guiding future development continue to evolve from pure recall and rote knowledge tasks, towards more practical work such as literature review and experimental planning. Bioinformatics is a domain where fully autonomous AI-driven discovery may be near, but no extensive benchmarks for measuring progress have been introduced to date. We therefore present the Bioinformatics Benchmark (BixBench), a dataset comprising over 50 real-world scenarios of practical biological data analysis with nearly 300 associated open-answer questions designed to measure the ability of LLM-based agents to explore biological datasets, perform long, multi-step analytical trajectories, and interpret the nuanced results of those analyses. We evaluate the performance of two frontier LLMs (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) using a custom agent framework we open source. We find that even the latest frontier models only achieve 17% accuracy in the open-answer regime, and no better than random in a multiple-choice setting. By exposing the current limitations of frontier models, we hope BixBench can spur the development of agents capable of conducting rigorous bioinformatic analysis and accelerate scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of LLMs-based Hidden States as Author Representations for Psychological Human-Centered NLP Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Like most of NLP, models for human-centered NLP tasks -- tasks attempting to assess author-level information -- predominantly use representations derived from hidden states of Transformer-based LLMs. However, what component of the LM is used for the representation varies widely. Moreover, there is a need for Human Language Models (HuLMs) that implicitly model the author and provide a user-level hidden state. Here, we systematically evaluate different ways of representing documents and users using different LM and HuLM architectures to predict task outcomes as both dynamically changing states and averaged trait-like user-level attributes of valence, arousal, empathy, and distress. We find that representing documents as an average of the token hidden states performs the best generally. Further, while a user-level hidden state itself is rarely the best representation, we find its inclusion in the model strengthens token or document embeddings used to derive document- and user-level representations resulting in best performances.</description>

      <title>AnnoCaseLaw: A Richly-Annotated Dataset For Benchmarking Explainable Legal Judgment Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Legal systems worldwide continue to struggle with overwhelming caseloads, limited judicial resources, and growing complexities in legal proceedings. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a promising solution, with Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) -- the practice of predicting a court's decision from the case facts -- emerging as a key research area. However, existing datasets often formulate the task of LJP unrealistically, not reflecting its true difficulty. They also lack high-quality annotation essential for legal reasoning and explainability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce AnnoCaseLaw, a first-of-its-kind dataset of 471 meticulously annotated U.S. Appeals Court negligence cases. Each case is enriched with comprehensive, expert-labeled annotations that highlight key components of judicial decision making, along with relevant legal concepts. Our dataset lays the groundwork for more human-aligned, explainable LJP models. We define three legally relevant tasks: (1) judgment prediction; (2) concept identification; and (3) automated case annotation, and establish a performance baseline using industry-leading large language models (LLMs). Our results demonstrate that LJP remains a formidable task, with application of legal precedent proving particularly difficult. Code and data are available at https://github.com/anonymouspolar1/annocaselaw.</description>

      <title>Learner and Instructor Needs in AI-Supported Programming Learning Tools: Design Implications for Features and Adaptive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-supported tools can help learners overcome challenges in programming education by providing adaptive assistance. However, existing research often focuses on individual tools rather than deriving broader design recommendations. A key challenge in designing these systems is balancing learner control with system-driven guidance. To explore user preferences for AI-supported programming learning tools, we conducted a participatory design study with 15 undergraduate novice programmers and 10 instructors to gather insights on their desired help features and control preferences, as well as a follow-up survey with 172 introductory programming students.
  Our qualitative findings show that learners prefer help that is encouraging, incorporates visual aids, and includes peer-related insights, whereas instructors prioritize scaffolding that reflects learners' progress and reinforces best practices. Both groups favor shared control, though learners generally prefer more autonomy, while instructors lean toward greater system guidance to prevent cognitive overload. Additionally, our interviews revealed individual differences in control preferences.
  Based on our findings, we propose design guidelines for AI-supported programming tools, particularly regarding user-centered help features and adaptive control mechanisms. Our work contributes to the human-centered design of AI-supported learning environments by informing the development of systems that effectively balance autonomy and guidance, enhancing AI-supported educational tools for programming and beyond.</description>

      <title>Palm: A Culturally Inclusive and Linguistically Diverse Dataset for Arabic LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily life, ensuring their cultural sensitivity and inclusivity is paramount. We introduce our dataset, a year-long community-driven project covering all 22 Arab countries. The dataset includes instructions (input, response pairs) in both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and dialectal Arabic (DA), spanning 20 diverse topics. Built by a team of 44 researchers across the Arab world, all of whom are authors of this paper, our dataset offers a broad, inclusive perspective. We use our dataset to evaluate the cultural and dialectal capabilities of several frontier LLMs, revealing notable limitations. For instance, while closed-source LLMs generally exhibit strong performance, they are not without flaws, and smaller open-source models face greater challenges. Moreover, certain countries (e.g., Egypt, the UAE) appear better represented than others (e.g., Iraq, Mauritania, Yemen). Our annotation guidelines, code, and data for reproducibility are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Fed-KAN: Federated Learning with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Traffic Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) are becoming a critical component of modern communication infrastructures, especially with the advent of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite systems. Traditional centralized learning approaches face major challenges in such networks due to high latency, intermittent connectivity and limited bandwidth. Federated Learning (FL) is a promising alternative as it enables decentralized training while maintaining data privacy. However, existing FL models, such as Federated Learning with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (Fed-MLP), can struggle with high computational complexity and poor adaptability to dynamic NTN environments. This paper provides a detailed analysis for Federated Learning with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (Fed-KAN), its implementation and performance improvements over traditional FL models in NTN environments for traffic forecasting. The proposed Fed-KAN is a novel approach that utilises the functional approximation capabilities of KANs in a FL framework. We evaluate Fed-KAN compared to Fed-MLP on a traffic dataset of real satellite operator and show a significant reduction in training and test loss. Our results show that Fed-KAN can achieve a 77.39% reduction in average test loss compared to Fed-MLP, highlighting its improved performance and better generalization ability. At the end of the paper, we also discuss some potential applications of Fed-KAN within O-RAN and Fed-KAN usage for split functionalities in NTN architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crohn's disease and intestinal tuberculosis share many overlapping features such as clinical, radiological, endoscopic, and histological features - particularly granulomas, making it challenging to clinically differentiate them. Our research leverages 3D CTE scans, computer vision, and machine learning to improve this differentiation to avoid harmful treatment mismanagement such as unnecessary anti-tuberculosis therapy for Crohn's disease or exacerbation of tuberculosis with immunosuppressants. Our study proposes a novel method to identify radiologist - identified biomarkers such as VF to SF ratio, necrosis, calcifications, comb sign and pulmonary TB to enhance accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness by using different ML techniques on the features extracted from these biomarkers, computing SHAP on XGBoost for understanding feature importance towards predictions, and comparing against SOTA methods such as pretrained ResNet and CTFoundation.</description>

      <title>PreMind: Multi-Agent Video Understanding for Advanced Indexing of Presentation-style Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, online lecture videos have become an increasingly popular resource for acquiring new knowledge. Systems capable of effectively understanding/indexing lecture videos are thus highly desirable, enabling downstream tasks like question answering to help users efficiently locate specific information within videos. This work proposes PreMind, a novel multi-agent multimodal framework that leverages various large models for advanced understanding/indexing of presentation-style videos. PreMind first segments videos into slide-presentation segments using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to enhance modern shot-detection techniques. Each segment is then analyzed to generate multimodal indexes through three key steps: (1) extracting slide visual content, (2) transcribing speech narratives, and (3) consolidating these visual and speech contents into an integrated understanding. Three innovative mechanisms are also proposed to improve performance: leveraging prior lecture knowledge to refine visual understanding, detecting/correcting speech transcription errors using a VLM, and utilizing a critic agent for dynamic iterative self-reflection in vision analysis. Compared to traditional video indexing methods, PreMind captures rich, reliable multimodal information, allowing users to search for details like abbreviations shown only on slides. Systematic evaluations on the public LPM dataset and an internal enterprise dataset are conducted to validate PreMind's effectiveness, supported by detailed analyses.</description>

      <title>PaliGemma-CXR: A Multi-task Multimodal Model for TB Chest X-ray Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) is a infectious global health challenge. Chest X-rays are a standard method for TB screening, yet many countries face a critical shortage of radiologists capable of interpreting these images. Machine learning offers an alternative, as it can automate tasks such as disease diagnosis, and report generation. However, traditional approaches rely on task-specific models, which cannot utilize the interdependence between tasks. Building a multi-task model capable of performing multiple tasks poses additional challenges such as scarcity of multimodal data, dataset imbalance, and negative transfer. To address these challenges, we propose PaliGemma-CXR, a multi-task multimodal model capable of performing TB diagnosis, object detection, segmentation, report generation, and VQA. Starting with a dataset of chest X-ray images annotated with TB diagnosis labels and segmentation masks, we curated a multimodal dataset to support additional tasks. By finetuning PaliGemma on this dataset and sampling data using ratios of the inverse of the size of task datasets, we achieved the following results across all tasks: 90.32% accuracy on TB diagnosis and 98.95% on close-ended VQA, 41.3 BLEU score on report generation, and a mAP of 19.4 and 16.0 on object detection and segmentation, respectively. These results demonstrate that PaliGemma-CXR effectively leverages the interdependence between multiple image interpretation tasks to enhance performance.</description>

      <title>Steering Large Language Model Activations in Sparse Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in AI alignment is guiding large language models (LLMs) to follow desired behaviors at test time. Activation steering, which modifies internal model activations during inference, offers a potential solution. However, prior work in dense activation spaces struggles with superposition, wherein multiple features become entangled, limiting interpretability and precise control. In contrast, sparse representations provide an untapped opportunity for more interpretable behavior modulation. In this work, we introduce sparse activation steering (SAS), a method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to steer LLM behavior in sparse spaces. By isolating behavior-specific features through a contrastive prompt-pairing approach, we define a set of features that can selectively reinforce or suppress behaviors. Experiments on Gemma 2 LLMs show that SAS vectors enable nuanced behavioral modulation and finer-grained control. Furthermore, scaling SAEs improves monosemanticity of SAS vectors, suggesting more reliable and interpretable interventions.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot and Efficient Clarification Need Prediction in Conversational Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clarification need prediction (CNP) is a key task in conversational search, aiming to predict whether to ask a clarifying question or give an answer to the current user query. However, current research on CNP suffers from the issues of limited CNP training data and low efficiency. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot and efficient CNP framework (Zef-CNP), in which we first prompt large language models (LLMs) in a zero-shot manner to generate two sets of synthetic queries: ambiguous and specific (unambiguous) queries. We then use the generated queries to train efficient CNP models. Zef-CNP eliminates the need for human-annotated clarification-need labels during training and avoids the use of LLMs with high query latency at query time. To further improve the generation quality of synthetic queries, we devise a topic-, information-need-, and query-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting strategy (TIQ-CoT). Moreover, we enhance TIQ-CoT with counterfactual query generation (CoQu), which guides LLMs first to generate a specific/ambiguous query and then sequentially generate its corresponding ambiguous/specific query. Experimental results show that Zef-CNP achieves superior CNP effectiveness and efficiency compared with zero- and few-shot LLM-based CNP predictors.</description>

      <title>Learning Vision-Based Neural Network Controllers with Semi-Probabilistic Safety Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous systems with vision-based control remains a critical challenge due to the high dimensionality of image inputs and the fact that the relationship between true system state and its visual manifestation is unknown. Existing methods for learning-based control in such settings typically lack formal safety guarantees. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel semi-probabilistic verification framework that integrates reachability analysis with conditional generative adversarial networks and distribution-free tail bounds to enable efficient and scalable verification of vision-based neural network controllers. Next, we develop a gradient-based training approach that employs a novel safety loss function, safety-aware data-sampling strategy to efficiently select and store critical training examples, and curriculum learning, to efficiently synthesize safe controllers in the semi-probabilistic framework. Empirical evaluations in X-Plane 11 airplane landing simulation, CARLA-simulated autonomous lane following, and F1Tenth lane following in a physical visually-rich miniature environment demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving formal safety guarantees while maintaining strong nominal performance.

      <title>PRISM: High-Resolution &amp; Precise Counterfactual Medical Image Generation using Language-guided Stable Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing reliable and generalizable deep learning systems for medical imaging faces significant obstacles due to spurious correlations, data imbalances, and limited text annotations in datasets. Addressing these challenges requires architectures robust to the unique complexities posed by medical imaging data. The rapid advancements in vision-language foundation models within the natural image domain prompt the question of how they can be adapted for medical imaging tasks. In this work, we present PRISM, a framework that leverages foundation models to generate high-resolution, language-guided medical image counterfactuals using Stable Diffusion. Our approach demonstrates unprecedented precision in selectively modifying spurious correlations (the medical devices) and disease features, enabling the removal and addition of specific attributes while preserving other image characteristics. Through extensive evaluation, we show how PRISM advances counterfactual generation and enables the development of more robust downstream classifiers for clinically deployable solutions. To facilitate broader adoption and research, we make our code publicly available at https://github.com/Amarkr1/PRISM.</description>

      <title>Quantifying First-Order Markov Violations in Noisy Reinforcement Learning: A Causal Discovery Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) methods frequently assume that each new observation completely reflects the environment's state, thereby guaranteeing Markovian (one-step) transitions. In practice, partial observability or sensor/actuator noise often invalidates this assumption. This paper proposes a systematic methodology for detecting such violations, combining a partial correlation-based causal discovery process (PCMCI) with a novel Markov Violation score (MVS). The MVS measures multi-step dependencies that emerge when noise or incomplete state information disrupts the Markov property.
  Classic control tasks (CartPole, Pendulum, Acrobot) serve as examples to illustrate how targeted noise and dimension omissions affect both RL performance and measured Markov consistency. Surprisingly, even substantial observation noise sometimes fails to induce strong multi-lag dependencies in certain domains (e.g., Acrobot). In contrast, dimension-dropping investigations show that excluding some state variables (e.g., angular velocities in CartPole and Pendulum) significantly reduces returns and increases MVS, while removing other dimensions has minimal impact.
  These findings emphasize the importance of locating and safeguarding the most causally essential dimensions in order to preserve effective single-step learning. By integrating partial correlation tests with RL performance outcomes, the proposed approach precisely identifies when and where the Markov assumption is violated. This framework offers a principled mechanism for developing robust policies, informing representation learning, and addressing partial observability in real-world RL scenarios. All code and experimental logs are accessible for reproducibility (https://github.com/ucsb/markovianess).</description>

      <title>Foundation-Model-Boosted Multimodal Learning for fMRI-based Neuropathic Pain Drug Response Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuropathic pain, affecting up to 10% of adults, remains difficult to treat due to limited therapeutic efficacy and tolerability. Although resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a promising non-invasive measurement of brain biomarkers to predict drug response in therapeutic development, the complexity of fMRI demands machine learning models with substantial capacity. However, extreme data scarcity in neuropathic pain research limits the application of high-capacity models. To address the challenge of data scarcity, we propose FMM$_{TC}$, a Foundation-Model-boosted Multimodal learning framework for fMRI-based neuropathic pain drug response prediction, which leverages both internal multimodal information in pain-specific data and external knowledge from large pain-agnostic data. Specifically, to maximize the value of limited pain-specific data, FMM$_{TC}$ integrates complementary information from two rs-fMRI modalities: Time series and functional Connectivity. FMM$_{TC}$ is further boosted by an fMRI foundation model with its external knowledge from extensive pain-agnostic fMRI datasets enriching limited pain-specific information. Evaluations with an in-house dataset and a public dataset from OpenNeuro demonstrate FMM$_{TC}$'s superior representation ability, generalizability, and cross-dataset adaptability over existing unimodal fMRI models that only consider one of the rs-fMRI modalities. The ablation study validates the effectiveness of multimodal learning and foundation-model-powered external knowledge transfer in FMM$_{TC}$. An integrated gradient-based interpretation study explains how FMM$_{TC}$'s cross-dataset dynamic behaviors enhance its adaptability. In conclusion, FMM$_{TC}$ boosts clinical trials in neuropathic pain therapeutic development by accurately predicting drug responses to improve the participant stratification efficiency.</description>

      <title>SafeAuto: Knowledge-Enhanced Safe Autonomous Driving with Multimodal Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional autonomous driving systems often struggle to integrate high-level reasoning with low-level control, resulting in suboptimal and sometimes unsafe driving behaviors. The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which can process both visual and textual data, presents an opportunity to unify perception and reasoning tasks within a single framework. However, effectively embedding precise safety knowledge into MLLMs for autonomous driving remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose SafeAuto, a novel framework that enhances MLLM-based autonomous driving systems by incorporating both unstructured and structured knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce the Position-Dependent Cross-Entropy (PDCE) loss function, designed to improve the accuracy of low-level control signal predictions when numerical values are represented as text. Second, to ensure safe autonomous driving by explicitly integrating precise safety knowledge into the MLLM, we develop a reasoning component for SafeAuto. This component translates driving safety regulations into first-order logic rules (e.g., "red light =&gt; stop") and incorporates these rules into a probabilistic graphical model, such as a Markov Logic Network (MLN). The MLN is trained to verify the predicted next actions using environmental attributes identified by attribute recognition models (e.g., detecting a red light) to form the predicates. Additionally, we construct a Multimodal RAG model that leverages video data, control signals, and environmental attributes to learn more effectively from past similar driving experiences. By integrating PDCE, MLN, and Multimodal RAG, SafeAuto significantly outperforms existing baselines across multiple datasets. This advancement enables more accurate, reliable, and safer autonomous driving systems that learn from experience, obey traffic laws, and perform precise control actions.</description>

      <title>Jawaher: A Multidialectal Dataset of Arabic Proverbs for LLM Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in instruction fine-tuning, alignment methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and optimization techniques like direct preference optimization (DPO) have significantly enhanced the adaptability of large language models (LLMs) to user preferences. However, despite these innovations, many LLMs continue to exhibit biases toward Western, Anglo-centric, or American cultures, with performance on English data consistently surpassing that of other languages. This reveals a persistent cultural gap in LLMs, which complicates their ability to accurately process culturally rich and diverse figurative language such as proverbs. To address this, we introduce Jawaher, a benchmark designed to assess LLMs' capacity to comprehend and interpret Arabic proverbs. Jawaher includes proverbs from various Arabic dialects, along with idiomatic translations and explanations. Through extensive evaluations of both open- and closed-source models, we find that while LLMs can generate idiomatically accurate translations, they struggle with producing culturally nuanced and contextually relevant explanations. These findings highlight the need for ongoing model refinement and dataset expansion to bridge the cultural gap in figurative language processing.</description>

Abstract: The widespread adoption of machine learning systems has raised critical concerns about fairness and bias, making mitigating harmful biases essential for AI development. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between fairness improvement and the removal of harmful biases in neural networks applied to computer vision tasks. First, we introduce a set of novel XAI-based metrics that analyze saliency maps to assess shifts in a model's decision-making process. Then, we demonstrate that successful debiasing methods systematically redirect model focus away from protected attributes. Additionally, we show that techniques originally developed for artifact removal can be effectively repurposed for fairness. These findings underscore the importance of ensuring that models are fair for the right reasons, contributing to the development of more ethical and trustworthy AI systems.</description>

      <title>1-Lipschitz Network Initialization for Certifiably Robust Classification Applications: A Decay Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the weight parametrization of two standard 1-Lipschitz network structure methodologies, the Almost-Orthogonal-Layers (AOL) and the SDP-based Lipschitz Layers (SLL), and derives their impact on the initialization for deep 1-Lipschitz feedforward networks in addition to discussing underlying issues surrounding this initialization. These networks are mainly used in certifiably robust classification applications to combat adversarial attacks by limiting the effects of perturbations on the output classification result. An exact and an upper bound for the parameterized weight variance was calculated assuming a standard Normal distribution initialization; additionally, an upper bound was computed assuming a Generalized Normal Distribution, generalizing the proof for Uniform, Laplace, and Normal distribution weight initializations. It is demonstrated that the weight variance holds no bearing on the output variance distribution and that only the dimension of the weight matrices matters. Additionally, this paper demonstrates that the weight initialization always causes deep 1-Lipschitz networks to decay to zero.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Content and Expression: Two-Dimensional Detection of AI-Generated Text</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wide usage of LLMs raises critical requirements on detecting AI participation in texts. Existing studies investigate these detections in scattered contexts, leaving a systematic and unified approach unexplored. In this paper, we present HART, a hierarchical framework of AI risk levels, each corresponding to a detection task. To address these tasks, we propose a novel 2D Detection Method, decoupling a text into content and language expression. Our findings show that content is resistant to surface-level changes, which can serve as a key feature for detection. Experiments demonstrate that 2D method significantly outperforms existing detectors, achieving an AUROC improvement from 0.705 to 0.849 for level-2 detection and from 0.807 to 0.886 for RAID. We release our data and code at https://github.com/baoguangsheng/truth-mirror.</description>

      <title>Input Specific Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The black-box nature of neural networks limits the ability to encode or impose specific structural relationships between inputs and outputs. While various studies have introduced architectures that ensure the network's output adheres to a particular form in relation to certain inputs, the majority of these approaches impose constraints on only a single set of inputs. This paper introduces a novel neural network architecture, termed the Input Specific Neural Network (ISNN), which extends this concept by allowing scalar-valued outputs to be subject to multiple constraints. Specifically, the ISNN can enforce convexity in some inputs, non-decreasing monotonicity combined with convexity with respect to others, and simple non-decreasing monotonicity or arbitrary relationships with additional inputs. The paper presents two distinct ISNN architectures, along with equations for the first and second derivatives of the output with respect to the inputs. These networks are broadly applicable.
  In this work, we restrict their usage to solving problems in computational mechanics. In particular, we show how they can be effectively applied to fitting data-driven constitutive models. We then embed our trained data-driven constitutive laws into a finite element solver where significant time savings can be achieved by using explicit manual differentiation using the derived equations as opposed to automatic differentiation. We also show how ISNNs can be used to learn structural relationships between inputs and outputs via a binary gating mechanism. Particularly, ISNNs are employed to model an anisotropic free energy potential to get the homogenized macroscopic response in a decoupled multiscale setting, where the network learns whether or not the potential should be modeled as polyconvex, and retains only the relevant layers while using the minimum number of inputs.</description>

      <title>Reducing Large Language Model Safety Risks in Women's Health using Semantic Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold substantial promise for clinical decision support. However, their widespread adoption in medicine, particularly in healthcare, is hindered by their propensity to generate false or misleading outputs, known as hallucinations. In high-stakes domains such as women's health (obstetrics &amp; gynaecology), where errors in clinical reasoning can have profound consequences for maternal and neonatal outcomes, ensuring the reliability of AI-generated responses is critical. Traditional methods for quantifying uncertainty, such as perplexity, fail to capture meaning-level inconsistencies that lead to misinformation. Here, we evaluate semantic entropy (SE), a novel uncertainty metric that assesses meaning-level variation, to detect hallucinations in AI-generated medical content. Using a clinically validated dataset derived from UK RCOG MRCOG examinations, we compared SE with perplexity in identifying uncertain responses. SE demonstrated superior performance, achieving an AUROC of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.75-0.78), compared to 0.62 (0.60-0.65) for perplexity. Clinical expert validation further confirmed its effectiveness, with SE achieving near-perfect uncertainty discrimination (AUROC: 0.97). While semantic clustering was successful in only 30% of cases, SE remains a valuable tool for improving AI safety in women's health. These findings suggest that SE could enable more reliable AI integration into clinical practice, particularly in resource-limited settings where LLMs could augment care. This study highlights the potential of SE as a key safeguard in the responsible deployment of AI-driven tools in women's health, leading to safer and more effective digital health interventions.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Heterogeneous Semi-supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel problem setup termed as Heterogeneous Semi-Supervised Learning (HSSL), which presents unique challenges by bridging the semi-supervised learning (SSL) task and the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) task, and expanding standard semi-supervised learning to cope with heterogeneous training data. At its core, HSSL aims to learn a prediction model using a combination of labeled and unlabeled training data drawn separately from heterogeneous domains that share a common set of semantic categories; this model is intended to differentiate the semantic categories of test instances sampled from both the labeled and unlabeled domains. In particular, the labeled and unlabeled domains have dissimilar label distributions and class feature distributions. This heterogeneity, coupled with the assorted sources of the test data, introduces significant challenges to standard SSL and UDA methods. Therefore, we propose a novel method, Unified Framework for Heterogeneous Semi-supervised Learning (Uni-HSSL), to address HSSL by directly learning a fine-grained classifier from the heterogeneous data, which adaptively handles the inter-domain heterogeneity while leveraging both the unlabeled data and the inter-domain semantic class relationships for cross-domain knowledge transfer and adaptation. We conduct comprehensive experiments and the experimental results validate the efficacy and superior performance of the proposed Uni-HSSL over state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning and unsupervised domain adaptation methods.</description>

      <title>Hidden Convexity of Fair PCA and Fast Solver via Eigenvalue Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a foundational technique in machine learning for dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional datasets. However, PCA could lead to biased outcomes that disadvantage certain subgroups of the underlying datasets. To address the bias issue, a Fair PCA (FPCA) model was introduced by Samadi et al. (2018) for equalizing the reconstruction loss between subgroups. The semidefinite relaxation (SDR) based approach proposed by Samadi et al. (2018) is computationally expensive even for suboptimal solutions. To improve efficiency, several alternative variants of the FPCA model have been developed. These variants often shift the focus away from equalizing the reconstruction loss. In this paper, we identify a hidden convexity in the FPCA model and introduce an algorithm for convex optimization via eigenvalue optimization. Our approach achieves the desired fairness in reconstruction loss without sacrificing performance. As demonstrated in real-world datasets, the proposed FPCA algorithm runs $8\times$ faster than the SDR-based algorithm, and only at most 85% slower than the standard PCA.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Knowledge Graph: Meta-Path Guided Retrieval and In-Graph Text for RAG-Equipped LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing. However, these models face challenges in retrieving precise information from vast datasets. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to combining LLMs with external information retrieval systems to enhance the accuracy and context of responses. Despite improvements, RAG still struggles with comprehensive retrieval in high-volume, low-information-density databases and lacks relational awareness, leading to fragmented answers.
  To address this, this paper introduces the Pseudo-Knowledge Graph (PKG) framework, designed to overcome these limitations by integrating Meta-path Retrieval, In-graph Text and Vector Retrieval into LLMs. By preserving natural language text and leveraging various retrieval techniques, the PKG offers a richer knowledge representation and improves accuracy in information retrieval. Extensive evaluations using Open Compass and MultiHop-RAG benchmarks demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in managing large volumes of data and complex relationships.</description>

      <title>Shifting Power: Leveraging LLMs to Simulate Human Aversion in ABMs of Bilateral Financial Exchanges, A bond market study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilateral markets, such as those for government bonds, involve decentralized and opaque transactions between market makers (MMs) and clients, posing significant challenges for traditional modeling approaches. To address these complexities, we introduce TRIBE an agent-based model augmented with a large language model (LLM) to simulate human-like decision-making in trading environments. TRIBE leverages publicly available data and stylized facts to capture realistic trading dynamics, integrating human biases like risk aversion and ambiguity sensitivity into the decision-making processes of agents. Our research yields three key contributions: first, we demonstrate that integrating LLMs into agent-based models to enhance client agency is feasible and enriches the simulation of agent behaviors in complex markets; second, we find that even slight trade aversion encoded within the LLM leads to a complete cessation of trading activity, highlighting the sensitivity of market dynamics to agents' risk profiles; third, we show that incorporating human-like variability shifts power dynamics towards clients and can disproportionately affect the entire system, often resulting in systemic agent collapse across simulations. These findings underscore the emergent properties that arise when introducing stochastic, human-like decision processes, revealing new system behaviors that enhance the realism and complexity of artificial societies.</description>

      <title>FLStore: Efficient Federated Learning Storage for non-training workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an approach for privacy-preserving Machine Learning (ML), enabling model training across multiple clients without centralized data collection. With an aggregator server coordinating training, aggregating model updates, and storing metadata across rounds. In addition to training, a substantial part of FL systems are the non-training workloads such as scheduling, personalization, clustering, debugging, and incentivization. Most existing systems rely on the aggregator to handle non-training workloads and use cloud services for data storage. This results in high latency and increased costs as non-training workloads rely on large volumes of metadata, including weight parameters from client updates, hyperparameters, and aggregated updates across rounds, making the situation even worse. We propose FLStore, a serverless framework for efficient FL non-training workloads and storage. FLStore unifies the data and compute planes on a serverless cache, enabling locality-aware execution via tailored caching policies to reduce latency and costs. Per our evaluations, compared to cloud object store based aggregator server FLStore reduces per request average latency by 71% and costs by 92.45%, with peak improvements of 99.7% and 98.8%, respectively. Compared to an in-memory cloud cache based aggregator server, FLStore reduces average latency by 64.6% and costs by 98.83%, with peak improvements of 98.8% and 99.6%, respectively. FLStore integrates seamlessly with existing FL frameworks with minimal modifications, while also being fault-tolerant and highly scalable.</description>

      <title>PINN-DT: Optimizing Energy Consumption in Smart Building Using Hybrid Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Digital Twin Framework with Blockchain Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of smart grid technologies necessitates the integration of cutting-edge computational methods to enhance predictive energy optimization. This study proposes a multi-faceted approach by incorporating (1) Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents trained using data from Digital Twins (DTs) to optimize energy consumption in real time, (2) Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to seamlessly embed physical laws within the optimization process, ensuring model accuracy and interpretability, and (3) Blockchain (BC) technology to facilitate secure and transparent communication across the smart grid infrastructure. The model was trained and validated using comprehensive datasets, including smart meter energy consumption data, renewable energy outputs, dynamic pricing, and user preferences collected from IoT devices. The proposed framework achieved superior predictive performance with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.237 kWh, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.298 kWh, and an R-squared (R2) value of 0.978, indicating a 97.8% explanation of data variance. Classification metrics further demonstrated the model's robustness, achieving 97.7% accuracy, 97.8% precision, 97.6% recall, and an F1 Score of 97.7%. Comparative analysis with traditional models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM, LSTM, and XGBoost revealed the superior accuracy and real-time adaptability of the proposed method. In addition to enhancing energy efficiency, the model reduced energy costs by 35%, maintained a 96% user comfort index, and increased renewable energy utilization to 40%. This study demonstrates the transformative potential of integrating PINNs, DT, and Blockchain technologies to optimize energy consumption in smart grids, paving the way for sustainable, secure, and efficient energy management systems.</description>

      <title>Investigating the contribution of terrain-following coordinates and conservation schemes in AI-driven precipitation forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) weather prediction (AIWP) models often produce ``blurry'' precipitation forecasts that overestimate drizzle and underestimate extremes. This study provides a novel solution to tackle this problem -- integrating terrain-following coordinates with global mass and energy conservation schemes into AIWP models. Forecast experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this solution using FuXi, an example AIWP model, adapted to 1.0$^\circ$ grid spacing data. Verification results show large performance gains. The conservation schemes are found to reduce drizzle bias, whereas using terrain-following coordinates improves the estimation of extreme events and precipitation intensity spectra. Furthermore, a case study reveals that terrain-following coordinates capture near-surface winds better over mountains, offering AIWP models more accurate information on understanding the dynamics of precipitation processes. The proposed solution of this study can benefit a wide range of AIWP models and bring insights into how atmospheric domain knowledge can support the development of AIWP models.</description>

      <title>More of the Same: Persistent Representational Harms Under Increased Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To recognize and mitigate the harms of generative AI systems, it is crucial to consider who is represented in the outputs of generative AI systems and how people are represented. A critical gap emerges when naively improving who is represented, as this does not imply bias mitigation efforts have been applied to address how people are represented. We critically examined this by investigating gender representation in occupation across state-of-the-art large language models. We first show evidence suggesting that over time there have been interventions to models altering the resulting gender distribution, and we find that women are more represented than men when models are prompted to generate biographies or personas. We then demonstrate that representational biases persist in how different genders are represented by examining statistically significant word differences across genders. This results in a proliferation of representational harms, stereotypes, and neoliberalism ideals that, despite existing interventions to increase female representation, reinforce existing systems of oppression.</description>

      <title>MCNet: Monotonic Calibration Networks for Expressive Uncertainty Calibration in Online Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In online advertising, uncertainty calibration aims to adjust a ranking model's probability predictions to better approximate the true likelihood of an event, e.g., a click or a conversion. However, existing calibration approaches may lack the ability to effectively model complex nonlinear relations, consider context features, and achieve balanced performance across different data subsets. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel model called Monotonic Calibration Networks, featuring three key designs: a monotonic calibration function (MCF), an order-preserving regularizer, and a field-balance regularizer. The nonlinear MCF is capable of naturally modeling and universally approximating the intricate relations between uncalibrated predictions and the posterior probabilities, thus being much more expressive than existing methods. MCF can also integrate context features using a flexible model architecture, thereby achieving context awareness. The order-preserving and field-balance regularizers promote the monotonic relationship between adjacent bins and the balanced calibration performance on data subsets, respectively. Experimental results on both public and industrial datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method in generating well-calibrated probability predictions.</description>

      <title>Structured Reasoning for Fairness: A Multi-Agent Approach to Bias Detection in Textual Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From disinformation spread by AI chatbots to AI recommendations that inadvertently reinforce stereotypes, textual bias poses a significant challenge to the trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we propose a multi-agent framework that systematically identifies biases by disentangling each statement as fact or opinion, assigning a bias intensity score, and providing concise, factual justifications. Evaluated on 1,500 samples from the WikiNPOV dataset, the framework achieves 84.9% accuracy$\unicode{x2014}$an improvement of 13.0% over the zero-shot baseline$\unicode{x2014}$demonstrating the efficacy of explicitly modeling fact versus opinion prior to quantifying bias intensity. By combining enhanced detection accuracy with interpretable explanations, this approach sets a foundation for promoting fairness and accountability in modern language models.</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of information and communication technology has facilitated easier access to information. However, this progress has also necessitated more stringent verification measures to ensure the accuracy of information, particularly within the context of Vietnam. This paper introduces an approach to address the challenges of Fact Verification using the Vietnamese dataset by integrating both sentence selection and classification modules into a unified network architecture. The proposed approach leverages the power of large language models by utilizing pre-trained PhoBERT and XLM-RoBERTa as the backbone of the network. The proposed model was trained on a Vietnamese dataset, named ISE-DSC01, and demonstrated superior performance compared to the baseline model across all three metrics. Notably, we achieved a Strict Accuracy level of 75.11\%, indicating a remarkable 28.83\% improvement over the baseline model.</description>

      <title>CRUPL: A Semi-Supervised Cyber Attack Detection with Consistency Regularization and Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-Labeling in Smart Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modern power grids are integrated with digital technologies and automation systems. The inclusion of digital technologies has made the smart grids vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Cyberattacks on smart grids can compromise data integrity and jeopardize the reliability of the power supply. Traditional intrusion detection systems often need help to effectively detect novel and sophisticated attacks due to their reliance on labeled training data, which may only encompass part of the spectrum of potential threats. This work proposes a semi-supervised method for cyber-attack detection in smart grids by leveraging the labeled and unlabeled measurement data. We implement consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to identify deviations from expected behavior and predict the attack classes. We use a curriculum learning approach to improve pseudo-labeling performance, capturing the model uncertainty. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in detecting different types of cyberattacks, minimizing the false positives by implementing them on publicly available datasets. The method proposes a promising solution by improving the detection accuracy to 99% in the presence of unknown samples and significantly reducing false positives.</description>

      <title>Octopus: Alleviating Hallucination via Dynamic Contrastive Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have obtained impressive performance in visual content understanding and multi-modal reasoning. Unfortunately, these large models suffer from serious hallucination problems and tend to generate fabricated responses. Recently, several Contrastive Decoding (CD) strategies have been proposed to alleviate hallucination by introducing disturbed inputs. Although great progress has been made, these CD strategies mostly apply a one-size-fits-all approach for all input conditions. In this paper, we revisit this process through extensive experiments. Related results show that hallucination causes are hybrid and each generative step faces a unique hallucination challenge. Leveraging these meaningful insights, we introduce a simple yet effective Octopus-like framework that enables the model to adaptively identify hallucination types and create a dynamic CD workflow. Our Octopus framework not only outperforms existing methods across four benchmarks but also demonstrates excellent deployability and expansibility.

      <title>AI-Augmented Thyroid Scintigraphy for Robust Classification</title>

Abstract: Thyroid scintigraphy is a key imaging modality for diagnosing thyroid disorders. Deep learning models for thyroid scintigraphy classification often face challenges due to limited and imbalanced datasets, leading to suboptimal generalization. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of different data augmentation techniques including Stable Diffusion (SD), Flow Matching (FM), and Conventional Augmentation (CA) to enhance the performance of a ResNet18 classifier for thyroid condition classification. Our results showed that FM-based augmentation consistently outperforms SD-based approaches, particularly when combined with original (O) data and CA (O+FM+CA), achieving both high accuracy and fair classification across Diffuse Goiter (DG), Nodular Goiter (NG), Normal (NL), and Thyroiditis (TI) cases. The Wilcoxon statistical analysis further validated the superiority of O+FM and its variants (O+FM+CA) over SD-based augmentations in most scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of FM-based augmentation as a superior approach for generating high-quality synthetic thyroid scintigraphy images and improving model generalization in medical image classification.</description>

      <title>Nucleolus Credit Assignment for Effective Coalitions in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), agents typically form a single grand coalition based on credit assignment to tackle a composite task, often resulting in suboptimal performance. This paper proposed a nucleolus-based credit assignment grounded in cooperative game theory, enabling the autonomous partitioning of agents into multiple small coalitions that can effectively identify and complete subtasks within a larger composite task. Specifically, our designed nucleolus Q-learning could assign fair credits to each agent, and the nucleolus Q-operator provides theoretical guarantees with interpretability for both learning convergence and the stability of the formed small coalitions. Through experiments on Predator-Prey and StarCraft scenarios across varying difficulty levels, our approach demonstrated the emergence of multiple effective coalitions during MARL training, leading to faster learning and superior performance in terms of win rate and cumulative rewards especially in hard and super-hard environments, compared to four baseline methods. Our nucleolus-based credit assignment showed the promise for complex composite tasks requiring effective subteams of agents.</description>

      <title>MIRROR: Multi-Modal Pathological Self-Supervised Representation Learning via Modality Alignment and Retention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Histopathology and transcriptomics are fundamental modalities in oncology, encapsulating the morphological and molecular aspects of the disease. Multi-modal self-supervised learning has demonstrated remarkable potential in learning pathological representations by integrating diverse data sources. Conventional multi-modal integration methods primarily emphasize modality alignment, while paying insufficient attention to retaining the modality-specific structures. However, unlike conventional scenarios where multi-modal inputs share highly overlapping features, histopathology and transcriptomics exhibit pronounced heterogeneity, offering orthogonal yet complementary insights. Histopathology provides morphological and spatial context, elucidating tissue architecture and cellular topology, whereas transcriptomics delineates molecular signatures through gene expression patterns. This inherent disparity introduces a major challenge in aligning them while maintaining modality-specific fidelity. To address these challenges, we present MIRROR, a novel multi-modal representation learning method designed to foster both modality alignment and retention. MIRROR employs dedicated encoders to extract comprehensive features for each modality, which is further complemented by a modality alignment module to achieve seamless integration between phenotype patterns and molecular profiles. Furthermore, a modality retention module safeguards unique attributes from each modality, while a style clustering module mitigates redundancy and enhances disease-relevant information by modeling and aligning consistent pathological signatures within a clustering space. Extensive evaluations on TCGA cohorts for cancer subtyping and survival analysis highlight MIRROR's superior performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in constructing comprehensive oncological feature representations and benefiting the cancer diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Conditioning on Local Statistics for Scalable Heterogeneous Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning is a distributed machine learning approach where multiple clients collaboratively train a model without sharing their local data, which contributes to preserving privacy. A challenge in federated learning is managing heterogeneous data distributions across clients, which can hinder model convergence and performance due to the need for the global model to generalize well across diverse local datasets. We propose to use local characteristic statistics, by which we mean some statistical properties calculated independently by each client using only their local training dataset. These statistics, such as means, covariances, and higher moments, are used to capture the characteristics of the local data distribution. They are not shared with other clients or a central node. During training, these local statistics help the model learn how to condition on the local data distribution, and during inference, they guide the client's predictions. Our experiments show that this approach allows for efficient handling of heterogeneous data across the federation, has favorable scaling compared to approaches that directly try to identify peer nodes that share distribution characteristics, and maintains privacy as no additional information needs to be communicated.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Insights in Model Inversion Robustness and Conditional Entropy Maximization for Collaborative Inference Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By locally encoding raw data into intermediate features, collaborative inference enables end users to leverage powerful deep learning models without exposure of sensitive raw data to cloud servers. However, recent studies have revealed that these intermediate features may not sufficiently preserve privacy, as information can be leaked and raw data can be reconstructed via model inversion attacks (MIAs). Obfuscation-based methods, such as noise corruption, adversarial representation learning, and information filters, enhance the inversion robustness by obfuscating the task-irrelevant redundancy empirically. However, methods for quantifying such redundancy remain elusive, and the explicit mathematical relation between this redundancy minimization and inversion robustness enhancement has not yet been established. To address that, this work first theoretically proves that the conditional entropy of inputs given intermediate features provides a guaranteed lower bound on the reconstruction mean square error (MSE) under any MIA. Then, we derive a differentiable and solvable measure for bounding this conditional entropy based on the Gaussian mixture estimation and propose a conditional entropy maximization (CEM) algorithm to enhance the inversion robustness. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our proposed CEM; without compromising feature utility and computing efficiency, plugging the proposed CEM into obfuscation-based defense mechanisms consistently boosts their inversion robustness, achieving average gains ranging from 12.9\% to 48.2\%.

      <title>A Survey of Adversarial Defenses in Vision-based Systems: Categorization, Methods and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks have emerged as a major challenge to the trustworthy deployment of machine learning models, particularly in computer vision applications. These attacks have a varied level of potency and can be implemented in both white box and black box approaches. Practical attacks include methods to manipulate the physical world and enforce adversarial behaviour by the corresponding target neural network models. Multiple different approaches to mitigate different kinds of such attacks are available in the literature, each with their own advantages and limitations. In this survey, we present a comprehensive systematization of knowledge on adversarial defenses, focusing on two key computer vision tasks: image classification and object detection. We review the state-of-the-art adversarial defense techniques and categorize them for easier comparison. In addition, we provide a schematic representation of these categories within the context of the overall machine learning pipeline, facilitating clearer understanding and benchmarking of defenses. Furthermore, we map these defenses to the types of adversarial attacks and datasets where they are most effective, offering practical insights for researchers and practitioners. This study is necessary for understanding the scope of how the available defenses are able to address the adversarial threats, and their shortcomings as well, which is necessary for driving the research in this area in the most appropriate direction, with the aim of building trustworthy AI systems for regular practical use-cases.</description>

      <title>LNUCB-TA: Linear-nonlinear Hybrid Bandit Learning with Temporal Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms fail to effectively capture both long-term trends and local patterns across all arms, leading to suboptimal performance in environments with rapidly changing reward structures. They also rely on static exploration rates, which do not dynamically adjust to changing conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LNUCB-TA, a hybrid bandit model integrating a novel nonlinear component (adaptive k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)) for reducing time complexity, alongside a global-and-local attention-based exploration mechanism. Our approach uniquely combines linear and nonlinear estimation techniques, with the nonlinear module dynamically adjusting k based on reward variance to enhance spatiotemporal pattern recognition. This reduces the likelihood of selecting suboptimal arms while improving reward estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. The attention-based mechanism ranks arms by past performance and selection frequency, dynamically adjusting exploration and exploitation in real time without requiring manual tuning of exploration rates. By integrating global attention (assessing all arms collectively) and local attention (focusing on individual arms), LNUCB-TA efficiently adapts to temporal and spatial complexities. Empirical results show LNUCB-TA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art linear, nonlinear, and hybrid bandits in cumulative and mean reward, convergence, and robustness across different exploration rates. Theoretical analysis further confirms its reliability with a sub-linear regret bound.</description>

      <title>BGM2Pose: Active 3D Human Pose Estimation with Non-Stationary Sounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose BGM2Pose, a non-invasive 3D human pose estimation method using arbitrary music (e.g., background music) as active sensing signals. Unlike existing approaches that significantly limit practicality by employing intrusive chirp signals within the audible range, our method utilizes natural music that causes minimal discomfort to humans. Estimating human poses from standard music presents significant challenges. In contrast to sound sources specifically designed for measurement, regular music varies in both volume and pitch. These dynamic changes in signals caused by music are inevitably mixed with alterations in the sound field resulting from human motion, making it hard to extract reliable cues for pose estimation. To address these challenges, BGM2Pose introduces a Contrastive Pose Extraction Module that employs contrastive learning and hard negative sampling to eliminate musical components from the recorded data, isolating the pose information. Additionally, we propose a Frequency-wise Attention Module that enables the model to focus on subtle acoustic variations attributable to human movement by dynamically computing attention across frequency bands. Experiments suggest that our method outperforms the existing methods, demonstrating substantial potential for real-world applications. Our datasets and code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Progressive Sparse Attention: Algorithm and System Co-design for Efficient Attention in LLM Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Processing long contexts has become a critical capability for modern large language models (LLMs). However, serving long-context LLMs comes with significant inference costs due to the high memory overhead of the key-value (KV) cache. Existing work leverages dynamic sparse attention algorithms (DSAes) to mitigate the KV cache overhead, but these algorithms rely on top-$k$ KV cache selection, which results in a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. A larger $k$ improves accuracy but decreases efficiency, while a smaller $k$ boosts efficiency but compromises accuracy. To overcome this trade-off, this paper presents PSA, a $\underline{P}$rogressive $\underline{S}$parse $\underline{A}$ttention mechanism that integrates algorithmic innovations with system co-design to achieve both high inference accuracy and improved efficiency in LLM serving. The PSA algorithm adaptively adjusts the KV cache budget of different tokens and layers according to their real attention weight distributions, rather than relying on a fixed budget $k$. This enables high accuracy while minimizing KV cache usage. To further enhance execution efficiency, we introduce a pipelined iteration scheme that reduces CPU-GPU interleaving and synchronization overhead during PSA computation. Additionally, we implement unified GPU memory management that optimizes PSA's memory utilization by accounting for uneven memory requirements across different model layers. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PSA reduces KV cache usage for attention computation by up to 2.4$\times$ and 8.8$\times$, and increases end-to-end serving throughput by up to 1.4$\times$ and 2.0$\times$, compared to state-of-the-art DSAes and systems without sparse attention, respectively.</description>

Abstract: The unprecedented dissemination of edge devices is accompanied by a growing demand for neuromorphic chips that can process time-series data natively without cloud support. Echo state network (ESN) is a class of recurrent neural networks that can be used to identify unique patterns in time-series data and predict future events. It is known for minimal computing resource requirements and fast training, owing to the use of linear optimization solely at the readout stage. In this work, a custom-design neuromorphic chip based on ESN targeting edge devices is proposed. The proposed system supports various learning mechanisms, including structural plasticity and synaptic plasticity, locally on-chip. This provides the network with an additional degree of freedom to continuously learn, adapt, and alter its structure and sparsity level, ensuring high performance and continuous stability. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed system as well as its robustness to noise against real-world time-series datasets while considering various topologies of data movement. An average accuracy of 95.95% and 85.24% are achieved on human activity recognition and prosthetic finger control, respectively. We also illustrate that the proposed system offers a throughput of 6x10^4 samples/sec with a power consumption of 47.7mW on a 65nm IBM process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perception-enhanced pre-training, particularly through grounding techniques, is widely adopted to enhance the performance of graphical user interface (GUI) agents. However, in resource-constrained scenarios, the format discrepancy between coordinate-oriented grounding and action-oriented reasoning limits the effectiveness of grounding for reasoning tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a query-oriented pivot approach called query inference, which serves as a bridge between GUI grounding and reasoning. By inferring potential user queries from a screenshot and its associated element coordinates, query inference improves the understanding of coordinates while aligning more closely with reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that query inference outperforms previous grounding techniques under the same training data scale. Notably, query inference achieves comparable or even better performance to large-scale grounding-enhanced OS-Atlas with less than 0.1% of training data. Furthermore, we explore the impact of reasoning formats and demonstrate that integrating additional semantic information into the input further boosts reasoning performance. The code is publicly available athttps://github.com/ZrW00/GUIPivot.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced text understanding and generation, becoming integral to applications across education, software development, healthcare, entertainment, and legal services. Despite considerable progress in improving model reliability, latency remains under-explored, particularly through recurrent generation, where models repeatedly produce similar or identical outputs, causing increased latency and potential Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerabilities.
  We propose RecurrentGenerator, a black-box evolutionary algorithm that efficiently identifies recurrent generation scenarios in prominent LLMs like LLama-3 and GPT-4o. Additionally, we introduce RecurrentDetector, a lightweight real-time classifier trained on activation patterns, achieving 95.24% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.87 in detecting recurrent loops. Our methods provide practical solutions to mitigate latency-related vulnerabilities, and we publicly share our tools and data to support further research.</description>

      <title>A physics-informed Bayesian optimization method for rapid development of electrical machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced slot and winding designs are imperative to create future high performance electrical machines (EM). As a result, the development of methods to design and improve slot filling factor (SFF) has attracted considerable research. Recent developments in manufacturing processes, such as additive manufacturing and alternative materials, has also highlighted a need for novel high-fidelity design techniques to develop high performance complex geometries and topologies. This study therefore introduces a novel physics-informed machine learning (PIML) design optimization process for improving SFF in traction electrical machines used in electric vehicles. A maximum entropy sampling algorithm (MESA) is used to seed a physics-informed Bayesian optimization (PIBO) algorithm, where the target function and its approximations are produced by Gaussian processes (GP)s. The proposed PIBO-MESA is coupled with a 2D finite element model (FEM) to perform a GP-based surrogate and provide the first demonstration of the optimal combination of complex design variables for an electrical machine. Significant computational gains were achieved using the new PIBO-MESA approach, which is 45% faster than existing stochastic methods, such as the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). The FEM results confirm that the new design optimization process and keystone shaped wires lead to a higher SFF (i.e. by 20%) and electromagnetic improvements (e.g. maximum torque by 12%) with similar resistivity. The newly developed PIBO-MESA design optimization process therefore presents significant benefits in the design of high-performance electric machines, with reduced development time and costs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoencoders are effective deep learning models that can function as generative models and learn latent representations for downstream tasks. The use of graph autoencoders - with both encoder and decoder implemented as message passing networks - is intriguing due to their ability to generate permutation-invariant graph representations. However, this approach faces difficulties because decoding a graph structure from a single vector is challenging, and comparing input and output graphs requires an effective permutation-invariant similarity measure. As a result, many studies rely on approximate methods.
  In this work, we explore the effect of graph matching precision on the training behavior and generation capabilities of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Our contribution is two-fold: (1) we propose a transformer-based message passing graph decoder as an alternative to a graph neural network decoder, that is more robust and expressive by leveraging global attention mechanisms. (2) We show that the precision of graph matching has significant impact on training behavior and is essential for effective de novo (molecular) graph generation.

      <title>Language Model Mapping in Multimodal Music Learning: A Grand Challenge Proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have seen remarkable success in representation learning and language models (LMs) using deep neural networks. Many studies aim to build the underlying connections among different modalities via the alignment and mappings at the token or embedding level, but so far, most methods are very data-hungry, limiting their performance in domains such as music where paired data are less abundant. We argue that the embedding alignment is only at the surface level of multimodal alignment. In this paper, we propose a grand challenge of \textit{language model mapping} (LMM), i.e., how to map the essence implied in the LM of one domain to the LM of another domain under the assumption that LMs of different modalities are tracking the same underlying phenomena. We first introduce a basic setup of LMM, highlighting the goal to unveil a deeper aspect of cross-modal alignment as well as to achieve more sample-efficiency learning. We then discuss why music is an ideal domain in which to conduct LMM research. After that, we connect LMM in music with a more general and challenging scientific problem of \textit{learning to take actions based on both sensory input and abstract symbols}, and in the end, present an advanced version of the challenge problem setup.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to present new alarming trends in the field of child sexual abuse through imagery, as part of SafeLine's research activities in the field of cybercrime, child sexual abuse material and the protection of children's rights to safe online experiences. It focuses primarily on the phenomenon of AI-generated CSAM, sophisticated ways employed for its production which are discussed in dark web forums and the crucial role that the open-source AI models play in the evolution of this overwhelming phenomenon. The paper's main contribution is a correlation analysis between the hotline's reports and domain names identified in dark web forums, where users' discussions focus on exchanging information specifically related to the generation of AI-CSAM. The objective was to reveal the close connection of clear net and dark web content, which was accomplished through the use of the ATLAS dataset of the Voyager system. Furthermore, through the analysis of a set of posts' content drilled from the above dataset, valuable conclusions on forum members' techniques employed for the production of AI-generated CSAM are also drawn, while users' views on this type of content and routes followed in order to overcome technological barriers set with the aim of preventing malicious purposes are also presented. As the ultimate contribution of this research, an overview of the current legislative developments in all country members of the INHOPE organization and the issues arising in the process of regulating the AI- CSAM is presented, shedding light in the legal challenges regarding the regulation and limitation of the phenomenon.</description>

      <title>HalCECE: A Framework for Explainable Hallucination Detection through Conceptual Counterfactuals in Image Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of artificial intelligence, the exploration of hallucinations within vision-language (VL) models emerges as a critical frontier. This work delves into the intricacies of hallucinatory phenomena exhibited by widely used image captioners, unraveling interesting patterns. Specifically, we step upon previously introduced techniques of conceptual counterfactual explanations to address VL hallucinations. The deterministic and efficient nature of the employed conceptual counterfactuals backbone is able to suggest semantically minimal edits driven by hierarchical knowledge, so that the transition from a hallucinated caption to a non-hallucinated one is performed in a black-box manner. HalCECE, our proposed hallucination detection framework is highly interpretable, by providing semantically meaningful edits apart from standalone numbers, while the hierarchical decomposition of hallucinated concepts leads to a thorough hallucination analysis. Another novelty tied to the current work is the investigation of role hallucinations, being one of the first works to involve interconnections between visual concepts in hallucination detection. Overall, HalCECE recommends an explainable direction to the crucial field of VL hallucination detection, thus fostering trustworthy evaluation of current and future VL systems.</description>

      <title>Rehearse With User: Personalized Opinion Summarization via Role-Playing based on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized opinion summarization is crucial as it considers individual user interests while generating product summaries. Recent studies show that although large language models demonstrate powerful text summarization and evaluation capabilities without the need for training data, they face difficulties in personalized tasks involving long texts. To address this, \textbf{Rehearsal}, a personalized opinion summarization framework via LLMs-based role-playing is proposed. Having the model act as the user, the model can better understand the user's personalized needs. Additionally, a role-playing supervisor and practice process are introduced to improve the role-playing ability of the LLMs, leading to a better expression of user needs. Furthermore, through suggestions from virtual users, the summary generation is intervened, ensuring that the generated summary includes information of interest to the user, thus achieving personalized summary generation. Experiment results demonstrate that our method can effectively improve the level of personalization in large model-generated summaries.</description>

      <title>PodAgent: A Comprehensive Framework for Podcast Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing Existing automatic audio generation methods struggle to generate podcast-like audio programs effectively. The key challenges lie in in-depth content generation, appropriate and expressive voice production. This paper proposed PodAgent, a comprehensive framework for creating audio programs. PodAgent 1) generates informative topic-discussion content by designing a Host-Guest-Writer multi-agent collaboration system, 2) builds a voice pool for suitable voice-role matching and 3) utilizes LLM-enhanced speech synthesis method to generate expressive conversational speech. Given the absence of standardized evaluation criteria for podcast-like audio generation, we developed comprehensive assessment guidelines to effectively evaluate the model's performance. Experimental results demonstrate PodAgent's effectiveness, significantly surpassing direct GPT-4 generation in topic-discussion dialogue content, achieving an 87.4% voice-matching accuracy, and producing more expressive speech through LLM-guided synthesis.

      <title>Leveraging Compute-in-Memory for Efficient Generative Model Inference in TPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advent of generative models, efficiently deploying these models on specialized hardware has become critical. Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are designed to accelerate AI workloads, but their high power consumption necessitates innovations for improving efficiency. Compute-in-memory (CIM) has emerged as a promising paradigm with superior area and energy efficiency. In this work, we present a TPU architecture that integrates digital CIM to replace conventional digital systolic arrays in matrix multiply units (MXUs). We first establish a CIM-based TPU architecture model and simulator to evaluate the benefits of CIM for diverse generative model inference. Building upon the observed design insights, we further explore various CIM-based TPU architectural design choices. Up to 44.2% and 33.8% performance improvement for large language model and diffusion transformer inference, and 27.3x reduction in MXU energy consumption can be achieved with different design choices, compared to the baseline TPUv4i architecture.</description>

      <title>Challenges in Testing Large Language Model Based Software: A Faceted Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-Agent LLMs (MALLMs) introduce non-determinism unlike traditional or machine learning software, requiring new approaches to verifying correctness beyond simple output comparisons or statistical accuracy over test datasets.
  This paper presents a taxonomy for LLM test case design, informed by both the research literature, our experience, and open-source tools that represent the state of practice. We identify key variation points that impact test correctness and highlight open challenges that the research, industry, and open-source communities must address as LLMs become integral to software systems.
  Our taxonomy defines four facets of LLM test case design, addressing ambiguity in both inputs and outputs while establishing best practices. It distinguishes variability in goals, the system under test, and inputs, and introduces two key oracle types: atomic and aggregated. Our mapping indicates that current tools insufficiently account for these variability points, highlighting the need for closer collaboration between academia and practitioners to improve the reliability and reproducibility of LLM testing.</description>

      <title>Interacting with AI Reasoning Models: Harnessing "Thoughts" for AI-Driven Software Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI reasoning models provide unprecedented transparency into their decision-making processes, transforming them from traditional black-box systems into models that articulate step-by-step chains of thought rather than producing opaque outputs. This shift has the potential to improve software quality, explainability, and trust in AI-augmented development. However, software engineers rarely have the time or cognitive bandwidth to analyze, verify, and interpret every AI-generated thought in detail. Without an effective interface, this transparency could become a burden rather than a benefit.
  In this paper, we propose a vision for structuring the interaction between AI reasoning models and software engineers to maximize trust, efficiency, and decision-making power. We argue that simply exposing AI's reasoning is not enough -- software engineers need tools and frameworks that selectively highlight critical insights, filter out noise, and facilitate rapid validation of key assumptions. To illustrate this challenge, we present motivating examples in which AI reasoning models state their assumptions when deciding which external library to use and produce divergent reasoning paths and recommendations about security vulnerabilities, highlighting the need for an interface that prioritizes actionable insights while managing uncertainty and resolving conflicts. We then outline a research roadmap for integrating automated summarization, assumption validation, and multi-model conflict resolution into software engineering workflows. Achieving this vision will unlock the full potential of AI reasoning models to enable software engineers to make faster, more informed decisions without being overwhelmed by unnecessary detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prior studies show that adopting the annotation diversity shaped by different backgrounds and life experiences and incorporating them into the model learning, i.e. multi-perspective approach, contribute to the development of more responsible models. Thus, in this paper we propose a new framework for designing and further evaluating perspective-aware models on stance detection task,in which multiple annotators assign stances based on a controversial topic. We also share a new dataset established through obtaining both human and LLM annotations. Results show that the multi-perspective approach yields better classification performance (higher F1-scores), outperforming the traditional approaches that use a single ground-truth, while displaying lower model confidence scores, probably due to the high level of subjectivity of the stance detection task.</description>

      <title>LLaSE-G1: Incentivizing Generalization Capability for LLaMA-based Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in semantic understanding and contextual modeling, which have flourished in generative speech enhancement (SE). However, many LM-based SE approaches primarily focus on semantic information, often neglecting the critical role of acoustic information, which leads to acoustic inconsistency after enhancement and limited generalization across diverse SE tasks. In this paper, we introduce LLaSE-G1, a LLaMA-based language model that incentivizes generalization capabilities for speech enhancement. LLaSE-G1 offers the following key contributions: First, to mitigate acoustic inconsistency, LLaSE-G1 employs continuous representations from WavLM as input and predicts speech tokens from X-Codec2, maximizing acoustic preservation. Second, to promote generalization capability, LLaSE-G1 introduces dual-channel inputs and outputs, unifying multiple SE tasks without requiring task-specific IDs. Third, LLaSE-G1 outperforms prior task-specific discriminative and generative SE models, demonstrating scaling effects at test time and emerging capabilities for unseen SE tasks. Additionally, we release our code and models to support further research in this area.</description>

      <title>Towards High-fidelity 3D Talking Avatar with Personalized Dynamic Texture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made for speech-driven 3D face animation, but most works focus on learning the motion of mesh/geometry, ignoring the impact of dynamic texture. In this work, we reveal that dynamic texture plays a key role in rendering high-fidelity talking avatars, and introduce a high-resolution 4D dataset \textbf{TexTalk4D}, consisting of 100 minutes of audio-synced scan-level meshes with detailed 8K dynamic textures from 100 subjects. Based on the dataset, we explore the inherent correlation between motion and texture, and propose a diffusion-based framework \textbf{TexTalker} to simultaneously generate facial motions and dynamic textures from speech. Furthermore, we propose a novel pivot-based style injection strategy to capture the complicity of different texture and motion styles, which allows disentangled control. TexTalker, as the first method to generate audio-synced facial motion with dynamic texture, not only outperforms the prior arts in synthesising facial motions, but also produces realistic textures that are consistent with the underlying facial movements.

      <title>Functional multi-armed bandit and the best function identification problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bandit optimization usually refers to the class of online optimization problems with limited feedback, namely, a decision maker uses only the objective value at the current point to make a new decision and does not have access to the gradient of the objective function. While this name accurately captures the limitation in feedback, it is somehow misleading since it does not have any connection with the multi-armed bandits (MAB) problem class. We propose two new classes of problems: the functional multi-armed bandit problem (FMAB) and the best function identification problem. They are modifications of a multi-armed bandit problem and the best arm identification problem, respectively, where each arm represents an unknown black-box function. These problem classes are a surprisingly good fit for modeling real-world problems such as competitive LLM training. To solve the problems from these classes, we propose a new reduction scheme to construct UCB-type algorithms, namely, the F-LCB algorithm, based on algorithms for nonlinear optimization with known convergence rates. We provide the regret upper bounds for this reduction scheme based on the base algorithms' convergence rates. We add numerical experiments that demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>End-To-End Learning of Gaussian Mixture Priors for Diffusion Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models optimized via variational inference (VI) have emerged as a promising tool for generating samples from unnormalized target densities. These models create samples by simulating a stochastic differential equation, starting from a simple, tractable prior, typically a Gaussian distribution. However, when the support of this prior differs greatly from that of the target distribution, diffusion models often struggle to explore effectively or suffer from large discretization errors. Moreover, learning the prior distribution can lead to mode-collapse, exacerbated by the mode-seeking nature of reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence commonly used in VI. To address these challenges, we propose end-to-end learnable Gaussian mixture priors (GMPs). GMPs offer improved control over exploration, adaptability to target support, and increased expressiveness to counteract mode collapse. We further leverage the structure of mixture models by proposing a strategy to iteratively refine the model by adding mixture components during training. Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements across a diverse range of real-world and synthetic benchmark problems when using GMPs without requiring additional target evaluations.</description>

      <title>Never too Prim to Swim: An LLM-Enhanced RL-based Adaptive S-Surface Controller for AUVs under Extreme Sea Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adaptivity and maneuvering capabilities of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have drawn significant attention in oceanic research, due to the unpredictable disturbances and strong coupling among the AUV's degrees of freedom. In this paper, we developed large language model (LLM)-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive S-surface controller for AUVs. Specifically, LLMs are introduced for the joint optimization of controller parameters and reward functions in RL training. Using multi-modal and structured explicit task feedback, LLMs enable joint adjustments, balance multiple objectives, and enhance task-oriented performance and adaptability. In the proposed controller, the RL policy focuses on upper-level tasks, outputting task-oriented high-level commands that the S-surface controller then converts into control signals, ensuring cancellation of nonlinear effects and unpredictable external disturbances in extreme sea conditions. Under extreme sea conditions involving complex terrain, waves, and currents, the proposed controller demonstrates superior performance and adaptability in high-level tasks such as underwater target tracking and data collection, outperforming traditional PID and SMC controllers.</description>

      <title>What Makes a Good Diffusion Planner for Decision Making?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown significant potential in solving decision-making problems, particularly in generating behavior plans -- also known as diffusion planning. While numerous studies have demonstrated the impressive performance of diffusion planning, the mechanisms behind the key components of a good diffusion planner remain unclear and the design choices are highly inconsistent in existing studies. In this work, we address this issue through systematic empirical experiments on diffusion planning in an offline reinforcement learning (RL) setting, providing practical insights into the essential components of diffusion planning. We trained and evaluated over 6,000 diffusion models, identifying the critical components such as guided sampling, network architecture, action generation and planning strategy. We revealed that some design choices opposite to the common practice in previous work in diffusion planning actually lead to better performance, e.g., unconditional sampling with selection can be better than guided sampling and Transformer outperforms U-Net as denoising network. Based on these insights, we suggest a simple yet strong diffusion planning baseline that achieves state-of-the-art results on standard offline RL benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has evolved to be one of the main methods for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). However, existing RLHF methods are non-robust, and their performance deteriorates if the downstream task differs significantly from the preference dataset used in fine-tuning. In order to mitigate this problem, we introduce a distributionally robust RLHF for fine-tuning LLMs. In particular, our goal is to ensure that a fine-tuned model retains its performance even when the distribution of prompts significantly differs from the distribution encountered during fine-tuning. We formulate distributionally robust optimization (DRO) version of two popular fine-tuning methods -- (1) reward-based RLHF and (2) reward-free DPO (direct preference optimization). We propose a minibatch gradient descent based algorithms for both of them, and theoretically prove convergence guarantees for the algorithms. Subsequently, we evaluate our algorithms on an out-of-distribution (OOD) task by first training the model on the Unified-Feedback dataset and evaluating its performance on two different datasets. The experimental results show that our robust training improves the accuracy of the learned reward models on average, and markedly on some tasks, such as reasoning. Furthermore, we show that the robust versions of policy optimization methods, similarly improve performance on OOD tasks.</description>

      <title>Safety Tax: Safety Alignment Makes Your Large Reasoning Models Less Reasonable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety alignment is an important procedure before the official deployment of a Large Language Model (LLM). While safety alignment has been extensively studied for LLM, there is still a large research gap for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that equip with improved reasoning capability. We in this paper systematically examine a simplified pipeline for producing safety aligned LRMs. With our evaluation of various LRMs, we deliver two main findings: i) Safety alignment can be done upon the LRM to restore its safety capability. ii) Safety alignment leads to a degradation of the reasoning capability of LRMs. The two findings show that there exists a trade-off between reasoning and safety capability with the sequential LRM production pipeline. The discovered trade-off, which we name Safety Tax, should shed light on future endeavors of safety research on LRMs. As a by-product, we curate a dataset called DirectRefusal, which might serve as an alternative dataset for safety alignment.

      <title>A Guide to Failure in Machine Learning: Reliability and Robustness from Foundations to Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main barriers to adoption of Machine Learning (ML) is that ML models can fail unexpectedly. In this work, we aim to provide practitioners a guide to better understand why ML models fail and equip them with techniques they can use to reason about failure. Specifically, we discuss failure as either being caused by lack of reliability or lack of robustness. Differentiating the causes of failure in this way allows us to formally define why models fail from first principles and tie these definitions to engineering concepts and real-world deployment settings. Throughout the document we provide 1) a summary of important theoretic concepts in reliability and robustness, 2) a sampling current techniques that practitioners can utilize to reason about ML model reliability and robustness, and 3) examples that show how these concepts and techniques can apply to real-world settings.</description>

      <title>LoR2C : Low-Rank Residual Connection Adaptation for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, pretrained large language models have demonstrated outstanding performance across various natural language processing tasks. However, full-parameter fine-tuning methods require adjusting all model parameters, leading to immense computational resource demands. Although parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA have significantly reduced the number of parameters, they still face challenges such as gradient vanishing and the potential for further parameter reduction. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method called LoR2C (Low-Rank Residual Connection Adaptation). LoR2C introduces residual connections with low-rank matrices within the model layers, which not only reduces the number of fine-tuning parameters but also effectively alleviates the gradient vanishing problem. Additionally, this paper presents three optimization variants of LoR2C: ShareLoR2C, MergeLoR2C, and InjectLoR2C. These variants further improve parameter efficiency and model performance through parameter sharing, module merging, and injection mechanisms, respectively. Experimental results on multiple natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks demonstrate that LoR2C and its optimized variants significantly reduce parameter overhead while maintaining or even improving performance, outperforming existing mainstream parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Oblivioniss/LoR2C.</description>

      <title>Brain Foundation Models: A Survey on Advancements in Neural Signal Processing and Brain Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain foundation models (BFMs) have emerged as a transformative paradigm in computational neuroscience, offering a revolutionary framework for processing diverse neural signals across different brain-related tasks. These models leverage large-scale pre-training techniques, allowing them to generalize effectively across multiple scenarios, tasks, and modalities, thus overcoming the traditional limitations faced by conventional artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in understanding complex brain data. By tapping into the power of pretrained models, BFMs provide a means to process neural data in a more unified manner, enabling advanced analysis and discovery in the field of neuroscience. In this survey, we define BFMs for the first time, providing a clear and concise framework for constructing and utilizing these models in various applications. We also examine the key principles and methodologies for developing these models, shedding light on how they transform the landscape of neural signal processing. This survey presents a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in BFMs, covering the most recent methodological innovations, novel views of application areas, and challenges in the field. Notably, we highlight the future directions and key challenges that need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of BFMs. These challenges include improving the quality of brain data, optimizing model architecture for better generalization, increasing training efficiency, and enhancing the interpretability and robustness of BFMs in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Graphs of Convex Sets for Multi-Robot Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP) problem of computing collision-free trajectories for multiple robots in shared continuous environments. While existing frameworks effectively decompose MRMP into single-robot subproblems, spatiotemporal motion planning with dynamic obstacles remains challenging, particularly in cluttered or narrow-corridor settings. We propose Space-Time Graphs of Convex Sets (ST-GCS), a novel planner that systematically covers the collision-free space-time domain with convex sets instead of relying on random sampling. By extending Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) into the time dimension, ST-GCS formulates time-optimal trajectories in a unified convex optimization that naturally accommodates velocity bounds and flexible arrival times. We also propose Exact Convex Decomposition (ECD) to "reserve" trajectories as spatiotemporal obstacles, maintaining a collision-free space-time graph of convex sets for subsequent planning. Integrated into two prioritized-planning frameworks, ST-GCS consistently achieves higher success rates and better solution quality than state-of-the-art sampling-based planners -- often at orders-of-magnitude faster runtimes -- underscoring its benefits for MRMP in challenging settings.</description>

      <title>BadJudge: Backdoor Vulnerabilities of LLM-as-a-Judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel backdoor threat attacking the LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation regime, where the adversary controls both the candidate and evaluator model. The backdoored evaluator victimizes benign users by unfairly assigning inflated scores to adversary. A trivial single token backdoor poisoning 1% of the evaluator training data triples the adversary's score with respect to their legitimate score. We systematically categorize levels of data access corresponding to three real-world settings, (1) web poisoning, (2) malicious annotator, and (3) weight poisoning. These regimes reflect a weak to strong escalation of data access that highly correlates with attack severity. Under the weakest assumptions - web poisoning (1), the adversary still induces a 20% score inflation. Likewise, in the (3) weight poisoning regime, the stronger assumptions enable the adversary to inflate their scores from 1.5/5 to 4.9/5. The backdoor threat generalizes across different evaluator architectures, trigger designs, evaluation tasks, and poisoning rates. By poisoning 10% of the evaluator training data, we control toxicity judges (Guardrails) to misclassify toxic prompts as non-toxic 89% of the time, and document reranker judges in RAG to rank the poisoned document first 97% of the time. LLM-as-a-Judge is uniquely positioned at the intersection of ethics and technology, where social implications of mislead model selection and evaluation constrain the available defensive tools. Amidst these challenges, model merging emerges as a principled tool to offset the backdoor, reducing ASR to near 0% whilst maintaining SOTA performance. Model merging's low computational cost and convenient integration into the current LLM Judge training pipeline position it as a promising avenue for backdoor mitigation in the LLM-as-a-Judge setting.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Keyphrase Generation: Investigating Specialized Instructions and Multi-Sample Aggregation on Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Keyphrases are the essential topical phrases that summarize a document. Keyphrase generation is a long-standing NLP task for automatically generating keyphrases for a given document. While the task has been comprehensively explored in the past via various models, only a few works perform some preliminary analysis of Large Language Models (LLMs) for the task. Given the impact of LLMs in the field of NLP, it is important to conduct a more thorough examination of their potential for keyphrase generation. In this paper, we attempt to meet this demand with our research agenda. Specifically, we focus on the zero-shot capabilities of open-source instruction-tuned LLMs (Phi-3, Llama-3) and the closed-source GPT-4o for this task. We systematically investigate the effect of providing task-relevant specialized instructions in the prompt. Moreover, we design task-specific counterparts to self-consistency-style strategies for LLMs and show significant benefits from our proposals over the baselines.</description>

      <title>Semantic Integrity Constraints: Declarative Guardrails for AI-Augmented Data Processing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of AI-augmented Data Processing Systems (DPSs) has introduced powerful semantic operators that extend traditional data management capabilities with LLM-based processing. However, these systems face fundamental reliability (a.k.a. trust) challenges, as LLMs can generate erroneous outputs, limiting their adoption in critical domains. Existing approaches to LLM constraints--ranging from user-defined functions to constrained decoding--are fragmented, imperative, and lack semantics-aware integration into query execution. To address this gap, we introduce Semantic Integrity Constraints (SICs), a novel declarative abstraction that extends traditional database integrity constraints to govern and optimize semantic operators within DPSs. SICs integrate seamlessly into the relational model, allowing users to specify common classes of constraints (e.g., grounding and soundness) while enabling query-aware enforcement and optimization strategies.
  In this paper, we present the core design of SICs, describe their formal integration into query execution, and detail our conception of grounding constraints, a key SIC class that ensures factual consistency of generated outputs. In addition, we explore novel enforcement mechanisms, combining proactive (constrained decoding) and reactive (validation and recovery) techniques to optimize efficiency and reliability. Our work establishes SICs as a foundational framework for trustworthy, high-performance AI-augmented data processing, paving the way for future research in constraint-driven optimizations, adaptive enforcement, and enterprise-scale deployments.</description>

      <title>Urban Safety Perception Through the Lens of Large Multimodal Models: A Persona-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how urban environments are perceived in terms of safety is crucial for urban planning and policymaking. Traditional methods like surveys are limited by high cost, required time, and scalability issues. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), specifically Llava 1.6 7B, as a novel approach to assess safety perceptions of urban spaces using street-view images. In addition, the research investigated how this task is affected by different socio-demographic perspectives, simulated by the model through Persona-based prompts. Without additional fine-tuning, the model achieved an average F1-score of 59.21% in classifying urban scenarios as safe or unsafe, identifying three key drivers of perceived unsafety: isolation, physical decay, and urban infrastructural challenges. Moreover, incorporating Persona-based prompts revealed significant variations in safety perceptions across the socio-demographic groups of age, gender, and nationality. Elder and female Personas consistently perceive higher levels of unsafety than younger or male Personas. Similarly, nationality-specific differences were evident in the proportion of unsafe classifications ranging from 19.71% in Singapore to 40.15% in Botswana. Notably, the model's default configuration aligned most closely with a middle-aged, male Persona. These findings highlight the potential of LMMs as a scalable and cost-effective alternative to traditional methods for urban safety perceptions. While the sensitivity of these models to socio-demographic factors underscores the need for thoughtful deployment, their ability to provide nuanced perspectives makes them a promising tool for AI-driven urban planning.</description>

      <title>PinLanding: Content-First Keyword Landing Page Generation via Multi-Modal AI for Web-Scale Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online platforms like Pinterest hosting vast content collections traditionally rely on manual curation or user-generated search logs to create keyword landing pages (KLPs) -- topic-centered collection pages that serve as entry points for content discovery. While manual curation ensures quality, it doesn't scale to millions of collections, and search log approaches result in limited topic coverage and imprecise content matching. In this paper, we present PinLanding, a novel content-first architecture that transforms the way platforms create topical collections. Instead of deriving topics from user behavior, our system employs a multi-stage pipeline combining vision-language model (VLM) for attribute extraction, large language model (LLM) for topic generation, and a CLIP-based dual-encoder architecture for precise content matching. Our model achieves 99.7% Recall@10 on Fashion200K benchmark, demonstrating strong attribute understanding capabilities. In production deployment for search engine optimization with 4.2 million shopping landing pages, the system achieves a 4X increase in topic coverage and 14.29% improvement in collection attribute precision over the traditional search log-based approach via human evaluation. The architecture can be generalized beyond search traffic to power various user experiences, including content discovery and recommendations, providing a scalable solution to transform unstructured content into curated topical collections across any content domain.</description>

      <title>An evaluation of DeepSeek Models in Biomedical Natural Language Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly impacted biomedical Natural Language Processing (NLP), enhancing tasks such as named entity recognition, relation extraction, event extraction, and text classification. In this context, the DeepSeek series of models have shown promising potential in general NLP tasks, yet their capabilities in the biomedical domain remain underexplored. This study evaluates multiple DeepSeek models (Distilled-DeepSeek-R1 series and Deepseek-LLMs) across four key biomedical NLP tasks using 12 datasets, benchmarking them against state-of-the-art alternatives (Llama3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B, Phi-4-14B, Gemma-2-9B). Our results reveal that while DeepSeek models perform competitively in named entity recognition and text classification, challenges persist in event and relation extraction due to precision-recall trade-offs. We provide task-specific model recommendations and highlight future research directions. This evaluation underscores the strengths and limitations of DeepSeek models in biomedical NLP, guiding their future deployment and optimization.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Editing Mixture-of-Experts Models with Compressed Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become a key approach for scaling large language models efficiently by activating only a subset of experts during training and inference. Typically, the number of activated experts presents a trade-off: fewer experts reduce computational costs, while more experts improve performance. Recent studies reveal that not all activated experts contribute equally to model performance, with some providing minimal utility, particularly when finetuning pretrained MoE models for specialized downstream tasks. The co-existence of significant and redundant parameters in experts provides us an opportunity to reduce the number of activated experts while maintaining model performance. In this work, we propose the concept of compressed experts, lightweight modules that serve as compact representations of full experts. Our approach preserves the most important experts while replacing other auxiliary activated experts with compressed experts. The reduction of active parameters significantly lowers inference costs while achieving comparable performance. Extensive experiments on models including Phi-MoE and OLMoE demonstrate that compressed experts recover over 90% of full expert performance across various tasks while reducing more than 30% active parameters and saving 20% in inference costs. This approach enables efficient deployment of MoE models in resource-constrained settings and facilitates scaling to larger models with manageable overhead.

      <title>Deep Change Monitoring: A Hyperbolic Representative Learning Framework and a Dataset for Long-term Fine-grained Tree Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In environmental protection, tree monitoring plays an essential role in maintaining and improving ecosystem health. However, precise monitoring is challenging because existing datasets fail to capture continuous fine-grained changes in trees due to low-resolution images and high acquisition costs. In this paper, we introduce UAVTC, a large-scale, long-term, high-resolution dataset collected using UAVs equipped with cameras, specifically designed to detect individual Tree Changes (TCs). UAVTC includes rich annotations and statistics based on biological knowledge, offering a fine-grained view for tree monitoring. To address environmental influences and effectively model the hierarchical diversity of physiological TCs, we propose a novel Hyperbolic Siamese Network (HSN) for TC detection, enabling compact and hierarchical representations of dynamic tree changes.
  Extensive experiments show that HSN can effectively capture complex hierarchical changes and provide a robust solution for fine-grained TC detection. In addition, HSN generalizes well to cross-domain face anti-spoofing task, highlighting its broader significance in AI. We believe our work, combining ecological insights and interdisciplinary expertise, will benefit the community by offering a new benchmark and innovative AI technologies.</description>

      <title>Generative Artificial Intelligence for Academic Research: Evidence from Guidance Issued for Researchers by Higher Education Institutions in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent development and use of generative AI (GenAI) has signaled a significant shift in research activities such as brainstorming, proposal writing, dissemination, and even reviewing. This has raised questions about how to balance the seemingly productive uses of GenAI with ethical concerns such as authorship and copyright issues, use of biased training data, lack of transparency, and impact on user privacy. To address these concerns, many Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) have released institutional guidance for researchers. To better understand the guidance that is being provided we report findings from a thematic analysis of guidelines from thirty HEIs in the United States that are classified as R1 or 'very high research activity.' We found that guidance provided to researchers: (1) asks them to refer to external sources of information such as funding agencies and publishers to keep updated and use institutional resources for training and education; (2) asks them to understand and learn about specific GenAI attributes that shape research such as predictive modeling, knowledge cutoff date, data provenance, and model limitations, and educate themselves about ethical concerns such as authorship, attribution, privacy, and intellectual property issues; and (3) includes instructions on how to acknowledge sources and disclose the use of GenAI, how to communicate effectively about their GenAI use, and alerts researchers to long term implications such as over reliance on GenAI, legal consequences, and risks to their institutions from GenAI use. Overall, guidance places the onus of compliance on individual researchers making them accountable for any lapses, thereby increasing their responsibility.</description>

      <title>OrdRankBen: A Novel Ranking Benchmark for Ordinal Relevance in NLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evaluation of ranking tasks remains a significant challenge in natural language processing (NLP), particularly due to the lack of direct labels for results in real-world scenarios. Benchmark datasets play a crucial role in providing standardized testbeds that ensure fair comparisons, enhance reproducibility, and enable progress tracking, facilitating rigorous assessment and continuous improvement of ranking models. Existing NLP ranking benchmarks typically use binary relevance labels or continuous relevance scores, neglecting ordinal relevance scores. However, binary labels oversimplify relevance distinctions, while continuous scores lack a clear ordinal structure, making it challenging to capture nuanced ranking differences effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce OrdRankBen, a novel benchmark designed to capture multi-granularity relevance distinctions. Unlike conventional benchmarks, OrdRankBen incorporates structured ordinal labels, enabling more precise ranking evaluations. Given the absence of suitable datasets for ordinal relevance ranking in NLP, we constructed two datasets with distinct ordinal label distributions. We further evaluate various models for three model types, ranking-based language models, general large language models, and ranking-focused large language models on these datasets. Experimental results show that ordinal relevance modeling provides a more precise evaluation of ranking models, improving their ability to distinguish multi-granularity differences among ranked items-crucial for tasks that demand fine-grained relevance differentiation.</description>

      <title>Factorized Deep Q-Network for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Victim Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass casualty incidents (MCIs) are a growing concern, characterized by complexity and uncertainty that demand adaptive decision-making strategies. The victim tagging step in the emergency medical response must be completed quickly and is crucial for providing information to guide subsequent time-constrained response actions. In this paper, we present a mathematical formulation of multi-agent victim tagging to minimize the time it takes for responders to tag all victims. Five distributed heuristics are formulated and evaluated with simulation experiments. The heuristics considered are on-the go, practical solutions that represent varying levels of situational uncertainty in the form of global or local communication capabilities, showcasing practical constraints. We further investigate the performance of a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) strategy, factorized deep Q-network (FDQN), to minimize victim tagging time as compared to baseline heuristics. Extensive simulations demonstrate that between the heuristics, methods with local communication are more efficient for adaptive victim tagging, specifically choosing the nearest victim with the option to replan. Analyzing all experiments, we find that our FDQN approach outperforms heuristics in smaller-scale scenarios, while heuristics excel in more complex scenarios. Our experiments contain diverse complexities that explore the upper limits of MARL capabilities for real-world applications and reveal key insights.</description>

      <title>GPIoT: Tailoring Small Language Models for IoT Program Synthesis and Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code Large Language Models (LLMs) enhance software development efficiency by automatically generating code and documentation in response to user requirements. However, code LLMs cannot synthesize specialized programs when tasked with IoT applications that require domain knowledge. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a promising solution by fetching relevant domain knowledge, it necessitates powerful cloud LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) to process user requirements and retrieved contents, which raises significant privacy concerns. This approach also suffers from unstable networks and prohibitive LLM query costs. Moreover, it is challenging to ensure the correctness and relevance of the fetched contents. To address these issues, we propose GPIoT, a code generation system for IoT applications by fine-tuning locally deployable Small Language Models (SLMs) on IoT-specialized datasets. SLMs have smaller model sizes, allowing efficient local deployment and execution to mitigate privacy concerns and network uncertainty. Furthermore, by fine-tuning the SLMs with our IoT-specialized datasets, the SLMs' ability to synthesize IoT-related programs can be substantially improved. To evaluate GPIoT's capability in synthesizing programs for IoT applications, we develop a benchmark, IoTBench. Extensive experiments and user trials demonstrate the effectiveness of GPIoT in generating IoT-specialized code, outperforming state-of-the-art code LLMs with an average task accuracy increment of 64.7% and significant improvements in user satisfaction.</description>

      <title>How Diversely Can Language Models Solve Problems? Exploring the Algorithmic Diversity of Model-Generated Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) have exhibited impressive abilities in generating code from natural language requirements. In this work, we highlight the diversity of code generated by LMs as a critical criterion for evaluating their code generation capabilities. There is a lack of studies focused on assessing the diversity of generated code, which overlooks its importance in code LMs. Therefore, we propose a systematic approach to evaluate code diversity, introducing various metrics with inter-code similarity. Specifically, we introduce code clustering methods that leverages LMs' capabilities in code understanding and reasoning, resulting in a set of metrics that represent the number of algorithms in model-generated solutions. We extensively investigate the property of model-generated solutions by contrasting them with human-written ones and quantifying the impact of various factors on code diversity: model size, temperature, instruction tuning, and problem complexity. Our analysis demonstrates that model-generated solutions exhibit low algorithmic diversity, which was neglected by the research community. Moreover, we explore methods to increase code diversity by combining solutions from different models and increasing sampling temperatures. Our findings highlight that code diversity can be enhanced with the help of heterogeneous models and setting temperature beyond 1.0 that has not been fully explored due to the functional correctness degradation. To facilitate our research direction, we publicly share our code and datasets through open-source repositories.</description>

      <title>CREATE-FFPE: Cross-Resolution Compensated and Multi-Frequency Enhanced FS-to-FFPE Stain Transfer for Intraoperative IHC Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis during surgery, frozen-section (FS) images are used to determine the benignity or malignancy of the tumor. However, FS image faces problems such as image contamination and poor nuclear detail, which may disturb the pathologist's diagnosis. In contrast, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) image has a higher staining quality, but it requires quite a long time to prepare and thus is not feasible during surgery. To help pathologists observe IHC images with high quality in surgery, this paper proposes a Cross-REsolution compensATed and multi-frequency Enhanced FS-to-FFPE (CREATE-FFPE) stain transfer framework, which is the first FS-to-FFPE method for the intraoperative IHC images. To solve the slide contamination and poor nuclear detail mentioned above, we propose the cross-resolution compensation module (CRCM) and the wavelet detail guidance module (WDGM). Specifically, CRCM compensates for information loss due to contamination by providing more tissue information across multiple resolutions, while WDGM produces the desirable details in a wavelet way, and the details can be used to guide the stain transfer to be more precise. Experiments show our method can beat all the competing methods on our dataset. In addition, the FID has decreased by 44.4%, and KID*100 has decreased by 71.2% by adding the proposed CRCM and WDGM in ablation studies, and the performance of a downstream microsatellite instability prediction task with public dataset can be greatly improved by performing our FS-to-FFPE stain transfer.</description>

      <title>Parameter Expanded Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide a promising framework for modeling predictive uncertainty and enhancing out-of-distribution robustness (OOD) by estimating the posterior distribution of network parameters. Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SGMCMC) is one of the most powerful methods for scalable posterior sampling in BNNs, achieving efficiency by combining stochastic gradient descent with second-order Langevin dynamics. However, SGMCMC often suffers from limited sample diversity in practice, which affects uncertainty estimation and model performance. We propose a simple yet effective approach to enhance sample diversity in SGMCMC without the need for tempering or running multiple chains. Our approach reparameterizes the neural network by decomposing each of its weight matrices into a product of matrices, resulting in a sampling trajectory that better explores the target parameter space. This approach produces a more diverse set of samples, allowing faster mixing within the same computational budget. Notably, our sampler achieves these improvements without increasing the inference cost compared to the standard SGMCMC. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks, including OOD robustness, diversity, loss surface analyses, and a comparative study with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>OpenECG: Benchmarking ECG Foundation Models with Public 1.2 Million Records</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces OpenECG, a large-scale benchmark of 1.2 million 12-lead ECG recordings from nine centers, to evaluate ECG foundation models (ECG-FMs) trained on public datasets. We investigate three self-supervised learning methods (SimCLR, BYOL, MAE) with ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer architectures, assessing model generalization through leave-one-dataset-out experiments and data scaling analysis. Results show that pre-training on diverse datasets significantly improves generalization, with BYOL and MAE outperforming SimCLR, highlighting the efficacy of feature-consistency and generative learning over contrastive approaches. Data scaling experiments reveal that performance saturates at 60-70% of total data for BYOL and MAE, while SimCLR requires more data. These findings demonstrate that publicly available ECG data can match or surpass proprietary datasets in training robust ECG-FMs, paving the way for scalable, clinically meaningful AI-driven ECG analysis.</description>

Abstract: Analyzing large datasets requires responsive query execution, but executing SQL queries on massive datasets can be slow. This paper explores whether query execution can begin even before the user has finished typing, allowing results to appear almost instantly. We propose SpeQL, a system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict likely queries based on the database schema, the user's past queries, and their incomplete query. Since exact query prediction is infeasible, SpeQL speculates on partial queries in two ways: 1) it predicts the query structure to compile and plan queries in advance, and 2) it precomputes smaller temporary tables that are much smaller than the original database, but are still predicted to contain all information necessary to answer the user's final query. Additionally, SpeQL continuously displays results for speculated queries and subqueries in real time, aiding exploratory analysis. A utility/user study showed that SpeQL improved task completion time, and participants reported that its speculative display of results helped them discover patterns in the data more quickly. In the study, SpeQL improves user's query latency by up to $289\times$ and kept the overhead reasonable, at $\$4$ per hour.</description>

      <title>LLMDR: LLM-Driven Deadlock Detection and Resolution in Multi-Agent Pathfinding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) is a core challenge in multi-agent systems. Existing learning-based MAPF methods often struggle with scalability, particularly when addressing complex scenarios that are prone to deadlocks. To address these challenges, we introduce LLMDR (LLM-Driven Deadlock Detection and Resolution), an approach designed to resolve deadlocks and improve the performance of learnt MAPF models. LLMDR integrates the inference capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with learnt MAPF models and prioritized planning, enabling it to detect deadlocks and provide customized resolution strategies. We evaluate LLMDR on standard MAPF benchmark maps with varying agent numbers, measuring its performance when combined with several base models. The results demonstrate that LLMDR improves the performance of learnt MAPF models, particularly in deadlock-prone scenarios, with notable improvements in success rates. These findings show the potential of integrating LLMs to improve the scalability of learning-based MAPF methods.

      <title>Enhancing Monocular 3D Scene Completion with Diffusion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction is essential for applications in virtual reality, robotics, and autonomous driving, enabling machines to understand and interact with complex environments. Traditional 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques rely on images captured from multiple viewpoints to achieve optimal performance, but this dependence limits their use in scenarios where only a single image is available. In this work, we introduce FlashDreamer, a novel approach for reconstructing a complete 3D scene from a single image, significantly reducing the need for multi-view inputs. Our approach leverages a pre-trained vision-language model to generate descriptive prompts for the scene, guiding a diffusion model to produce images from various perspectives, which are then fused to form a cohesive 3D reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method effectively and robustly expands single-image inputs into a comprehensive 3D scene, extending monocular 3D reconstruction capabilities without further training. Our code is available https://github.com/CharlieSong1999/FlashDreamer/tree/main.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose AUKAI, an Adaptive Unified Knowledge-Action Intelligence for embodied cognition that seamlessly integrates perception, memory, and decision-making via multi-scale error feedback. Interpreting AUKAI as an embedded world model, our approach simultaneously predicts state transitions and evaluates intervention utility. The framework is underpinned by rigorous theoretical analysis drawn from convergence theory, optimal control, and Bayesian inference, which collectively establish conditions for convergence, stability, and near-optimal performance. Furthermore, we present a hybrid implementation that combines the strengths of neural networks with symbolic reasoning modules, thereby enhancing interpretability and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of AUKAI through a detailed application in robotic navigation and obstacle avoidance, and we outline comprehensive experimental plans to validate its effectiveness in both simulated and real-world environments.</description>

      <title>CLEA: Closed-Loop Embodied Agent for Enhancing Task Execution in Dynamic Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in the hierarchical decomposition of complex tasks through semantic reasoning. However, their application in embodied systems faces challenges in ensuring reliable execution of subtask sequences and achieving one-shot success in long-term task completion. To address these limitations in dynamic environments, we propose Closed-Loop Embodied Agent (CLEA) -- a novel architecture incorporating four specialized open-source LLMs with functional decoupling for closed-loop task management. The framework features two core innovations: (1) Interactive task planner that dynamically generates executable subtasks based on the environmental memory, and (2) Multimodal execution critic employing an evaluation framework to conduct a probabilistic assessment of action feasibility, triggering hierarchical re-planning mechanisms when environmental perturbations exceed preset thresholds. To validate CLEA's effectiveness, we conduct experiments in a real environment with manipulable objects, using two heterogeneous robots for object search, manipulation, and search-manipulation integration tasks. Across 12 task trials, CLEA outperforms the baseline model, achieving a 67.3% improvement in success rate and a 52.8% increase in task completion rate. These results demonstrate that CLEA significantly enhances the robustness of task planning and execution in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>LADDER: Self-Improving LLMs Through Recursive Problem Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LADDER (Learning through Autonomous Difficulty-Driven Example Recursion), a framework enabling LLMs to autonomously improve their problem-solving capabilities through self-guided learning. By recursively generating and solving progressively simpler variants of complex problems, LADDER enables models to progressively learn through reinforcement learning how to solve harder problems. This self-improvement process is guided by verifiable reward signals, allowing the model to assess its solutions. Unlike prior approaches requiring curated datasets or human feedback, LADDER leverages the model's own capabilities to easier variants of sample questions. We demonstrate LADDER's effectiveness on mathematical integration tasks, where it improves a Llama 3B model's accuracy from 1\% to 82\% on undergraduate-level problems and enables a 7B parameter model to achieve state-of-the-art performance (70\%) on the MIT Integration Bee examination for it's model size. We also introduce TTRL (Test-Time Reinforcement Learning), a method that generates variants of test problems at inference time and applies reinforcement learning to further improve performance. By further creating and solving related problems during testing, TTRL enables the 7B model to achieve a score of 85\%, surpassing o1. These results showcase how strategic self-directed learning can achieve significant capability improvements without relying on architectural scaling or human supervision.</description>

      <title>Confounder-Aware Medical Data Selection for Fine-Tuning Pretrained Vision Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of large-scale pre-trained vision foundation models has greatly advanced the medical imaging field through the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. However, selecting appropriate medical data for downstream fine-tuning remains a significant challenge considering its annotation cost, privacy concerns, and the detrimental effects of confounding variables. In this work, we present a confounder-aware medical data selection approach for medical dataset curation aiming to select minimal representative data by strategically mitigating the undesirable impact of confounding variables while preserving the natural distribution of the dataset. Our approach first identifies confounding variables within data and then develops a distance-based data selection strategy for confounder-aware sampling with a constrained budget in the data size. We validate the superiority of our approach through extensive experiments across diverse medical imaging modalities, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the substantial impact of confounding variables and enhancing the fine-tuning efficiency in the medical imaging domain, compared to other data selection approaches.</description>

      <title>Edge Prompt Tuning for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-training powerful Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with unlabeled graph data in a self-supervised manner has emerged as a prominent technique in recent years. However, inevitable objective gaps often exist between pre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompt tuning techniques design and learn graph prompts by manipulating input graphs or reframing downstream tasks as pre-training tasks without fine-tuning the pre-trained GNN models. While recent graph prompt tuning methods have proven effective in adapting pre-trained GNN models for downstream tasks, they overlook the crucial role of edges in graph prompt design, which can significantly affect the quality of graph representations for downstream tasks. In this study, we propose EdgePrompt, a simple yet effective graph prompt tuning method from the perspective of edges. Unlike previous studies that design prompt vectors on node features, EdgePrompt manipulates input graphs by learning additional prompt vectors for edges and incorporates the edge prompts through message passing in the pre-trained GNN models to better embed graph structural information for downstream tasks. Our method is compatible with prevalent GNN architectures pre-trained under various pre-training strategies and is universal for different downstream tasks. We provide comprehensive theoretical analyses of our method regarding its capability of handling node classification and graph classification as downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on ten graph datasets under four pre-training strategies demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method against six baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/xbfu/EdgePrompt.</description>

      <title>RAPID: Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Long Text Generation with Writing Planning and Information Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating knowledge-intensive and comprehensive long texts, such as encyclopedia articles, remains significant challenges for Large Language Models. It requires not only the precise integration of facts but also the maintenance of thematic coherence throughout the article. Existing methods, such as direct generation and multi-agent discussion, often struggle with issues like hallucinations, topic incoherence, and significant latency. To address these challenges, we propose RAPID, an efficient retrieval-augmented long text generation framework. RAPID consists of three main modules: (1) Retrieval-augmented preliminary outline generation to reduce hallucinations, (2) Attribute-constrained search for efficient information discovery, (3) Plan-guided article generation for enhanced coherence. Extensive experiments on our newly compiled benchmark dataset, FreshWiki-2024, demonstrate that RAPID significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of evaluation metrics (e.g. long-text generation, outline quality, latency, etc). Our work provides a robust and efficient solution to the challenges of automated long-text generation.</description>

      <title>MR-EIT: Multi-Resolution Reconstruction for Electrical Impedance Tomography via Data-Driven and Unsupervised Dual-Mode Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a multi-resolution reconstruction method for Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), referred to as MR-EIT, which is capable of operating in both supervised and unsupervised learning modes. MR-EIT integrates an ordered feature extraction module and an unordered coordinate feature expression module. The former achieves the mapping from voltage to two-dimensional conductivity features through pre-training, while the latter realizes multi-resolution reconstruction independent of the order and size of the input sequence by utilizing symmetric functions and local feature extraction mechanisms. In the data-driven mode, MR-EIT reconstructs high-resolution images from low-resolution data of finite element meshes through two stages of pre-training and joint training, and demonstrates excellent performance in simulation experiments. In the unsupervised learning mode, MR-EIT does not require pre-training data and performs iterative optimization solely based on measured voltages to rapidly achieve image reconstruction from low to high resolution. It shows robustness to noise and efficient super-resolution reconstruction capabilities in both simulation and real water tank experiments. Experimental results indicate that MR-EIT outperforms the comparison methods in terms of Structural Similarity (SSIM) and Relative Image Error (RIE), especially in the unsupervised learning mode, where it can significantly reduce the number of iterations and improve image reconstruction quality.</description>

      <title>LLMs are everywhere: Ubiquitous Utilization of AI Models through Air Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are witnessing a new era where problem-solving and cognitive tasks are being increasingly delegated to Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse domains, ranging from code generation to holiday planning. This trend also creates a demand for the ubiquitous execution of LLM-powered applications in a wide variety of environments in which traditional terrestrial 2D networking infrastructures may prove insufficient. A promising solution in this context is to extend edge computing into a 3D setting to include aerial platforms organized in multiple layers, a paradigm we refer to as air computing, to augment local devices for running LLM and Generative AI (GenAI) applications. This approach alleviates the strain on existing infrastructure while enhancing service efficiency by offloading computational tasks to the corresponding air units such as UAVs. Furthermore, the coordinated deployment of various air units can significantly improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) by ensuring seamless, adaptive, and resilient task execution. In this study, we investigate the synergy between LLM-based applications and air computing, exploring their potential across various use cases. Additionally, we present a disaster response case study demonstrating how the collaborative utilization of LLMs and air computing can significantly improve outcomes in critical situations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Endoscopy serves as an essential procedure for evaluating the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and plays a pivotal role in identifying GI-related disorders. Recent advancements in deep learning have demonstrated substantial progress in detecting abnormalities through intricate models and data augmentation methods.This research introduces a novel approach to enhance classification accuracy using 8,000 labeled endoscopic images from the Kvasir dataset, categorized into eight distinct classes. Leveraging EfficientNetB3 as the backbone, the proposed architecture eliminates reliance on data augmentation while preserving moderate model complexity. The model achieves a test accuracy of 94.25%, alongside precision and recall of 94.29% and 94.24% respectively. Furthermore, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) saliency maps are employed to enhance interpretability by defining critical regions in the images that influenced model predictions. Overall, this work highlights the importance of AI in advancing medical imaging by combining high classification accuracy with interpretability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven immensely beneficial in education by capturing vast amounts of literature-based information, allowing them to generate context without relying on external sources. In this paper, we propose a generative AI-powered GATE question-answering framework (GATE stands for Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) that leverages LLMs to explain GATE solutions and support students in their exam preparation. We conducted extensive benchmarking to select the optimal embedding model and LLM, evaluating our framework based on criteria such as latency, faithfulness, and relevance, with additional validation through human evaluation. Our chatbot integrates state-of-the-art embedding models and LLMs to deliver accurate, context-aware responses. Through rigorous experimentation, we identified configurations that balance performance and computational efficiency, ensuring a reliable chatbot to serve students' needs. Additionally, we discuss the challenges faced in data processing and modeling and implemented solutions. Our work explores the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for GATE Q/A explanation tasks, and our findings demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and response quality. This research offers practical insights for developing effective AI-driven educational tools while highlighting areas for future enhancement in usability and scalability.</description>

      <title>FLOAT Drone: A Fully-actuated Coaxial Aerial Robot for Close-Proximity Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How to endow aerial robots with the ability to operate in close proximity remains an open problem. The core challenges lie in the propulsion system's dual-task requirement: generating manipulation forces while simultaneously counteracting gravity. These competing demands create dynamic coupling effects during physical interactions. Furthermore, rotor-induced airflow disturbances critically undermine operational reliability. Although fully-actuated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) alleviate dynamic coupling effects via six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) force-torque decoupling, existing implementations fail to address the aerodynamic interference between drones and environments. They also suffer from oversized designs, which compromise maneuverability and limit their applications in various operational scenarios. To address these limitations, we present FLOAT Drone (FuLly-actuated cOaxial Aerial roboT), a novel fully-actuated UAV featuring two key structural innovations. By integrating control surfaces into fully-actuated systems for the first time, we significantly suppress lateral airflow disturbances during operations. Furthermore, a coaxial dual-rotor configuration enables a compact size while maintaining high hovering efficiency. Through dynamic modeling, we have developed hierarchical position and attitude controllers that support both fully-actuated and underactuated modes. Experimental validation through comprehensive real-world experiments confirms the system's functional capabilities in close-proximity operations.</description>

      <title>Graph Attention Networks Unleashed: A Fast and Explainable Vulnerability Assessment Framework for Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Independent microgrids are crucial for supplying electricity by combining distributed energy resources and loads in scenarios like isolated islands and field combat. Fast and accurate assessments of microgrid vulnerability against intentional attacks or natural disasters are essential for effective risk prevention and design optimization. However, conventional Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) methods are computationally expensive and time-consuming, while existing machine learning-based approaches often lack accuracy and explainability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a fast and explainable vulnerability assessment framework that integrates MCS with a graph attention network enhanced by self-attention pooling (GAT-S). MCS generates training data, while the GAT-S model learns the structural and electrical characteristics of the microgrid and further assesses its vulnerability intelligently. The GAT-S improves explainability and computational efficiency by dynamically assigning attention weights to critical nodes. Comprehensive experimental evaluations across various microgrid configurations demonstrate that the proposed framework provides accurate vulnerability assessments, achieving a mean squared error as low as 0.001, real-time responsiveness within 1 second, and delivering explainable results.</description>

      <title>Taming Infinity one Chunk at a Time: Concisely Represented Strategies in One-Counter MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) are a canonical model to reason about decision making within a stochastic environment. We study a fundamental class of infinite MDPs: one-counter MDPs (OC-MDPs). They extend finite MDPs via an associated counter taking natural values, thus inducing an infinite MDP over the set of configurations (current state and counter value). We consider two characteristic objectives: reaching a target state (state-reachability), and reaching a target state with counter value zero (selective termination). The synthesis problem for the latter is not known to be decidable and connected to major open problems in number theory. Furthermore, even seemingly simple strategies (e.g., memoryless ones) in OC-MDPs might be impossible to build in practice (due to the underlying infinite configuration space): we need finite, and preferably small, representations.
  To overcome these obstacles, we introduce two natural classes of concisely represented strategies based on a (possibly infinite) partition of counter values in intervals. For both classes, and both objectives, we study the verification problem (does a given strategy ensure a high enough probability for the objective?), and two synthesis problems (does there exist such a strategy?): one where the interval partition is fixed as input, and one where it is only parameterized. We develop a generic approach based on a compression of the induced infinite MDP that yields decidability in all cases, with all complexities within PSPACE.</description>

      <title>Bridging Spectral-wise and Multi-spectral Depth Estimation via Geometry-guided Contrastive Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying depth estimation networks in the real world requires high-level robustness against various adverse conditions to ensure safe and reliable autonomy. For this purpose, many autonomous vehicles employ multi-modal sensor systems, including an RGB camera, NIR camera, thermal camera, LiDAR, or Radar. They mainly adopt two strategies to use multiple sensors: modality-wise and multi-modal fused inference. The former method is flexible but memory-inefficient, unreliable, and vulnerable. Multi-modal fusion can provide high-level reliability, yet it needs a specialized architecture. In this paper, we propose an effective solution, named align-and-fuse strategy, for the depth estimation from multi-spectral images. In the align stage, we align embedding spaces between multiple spectrum bands to learn shareable representation across multi-spectral images by minimizing contrastive loss of global and spatially aligned local features with geometry cue. After that, in the fuse stage, we train an attachable feature fusion module that can selectively aggregate the multi-spectral features for reliable and robust prediction results. Based on the proposed method, a single-depth network can achieve both spectral-invariant and multi-spectral fused depth estimation while preserving reliability, memory efficiency, and flexibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fuzz testing is a crucial component of software security assessment, yet its effectiveness heavily relies on valid fuzz drivers and diverse seed inputs. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer transformative potential for automating fuzz testing (LLM4Fuzz), particularly in generating drivers and seeds. However, current LLM4Fuzz solutions face critical reliability challenges, including low driver validity rates and seed quality trade-offs, hindering their practical adoption.
  This paper aims to examine the reliability bottlenecks of LLM-driven fuzzing and explores potential research directions to address these limitations. It begins with an overview of the current development of LLM4SE and emphasizes the necessity for developing reliable LLM4Fuzz solutions. Following this, the paper envisions a vision where reliable LLM4Fuzz transforms the landscape of software testing and security for industry, software development practitioners, and economic accessibility. It then outlines a road ahead for future research, identifying key challenges and offering specific suggestions for the researchers to consider. This work strives to spark innovation in the field, positioning reliable LLM4Fuzz as a fundamental component of modern software testing.</description>

      <title>DELST: Dual Entailment Learning for Hyperbolic Image-Gene Pretraining in Spatial Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) maps gene expression within tissue at individual spots, making it a valuable resource for multimodal representation learning. Additionally, ST inherently contains rich hierarchical information both across and within modalities. For instance, different spots exhibit varying numbers of nonzero gene expressions, corresponding to different levels of cellular activity and semantic hierarchies. However, existing methods rely on contrastive alignment of image-gene pairs, failing to accurately capture the intricate hierarchical relationships in ST data. Here, we propose DELST, the first framework to embed hyperbolic representations while modeling hierarchy for image-gene pretraining at two levels: (1) Cross-modal entailment learning, which establishes an order relationship between genes and images to enhance image representation generalization; (2) Intra-modal entailment learning, which encodes gene expression patterns as hierarchical relationships, guiding hierarchical learning across different samples at a global scale and integrating biological insights into single-modal representations. Extensive experiments on ST benchmarks annotated by pathologists demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, achieving improved predictive performance compared to existing methods.

      <description>arXiv:2503.00821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation instruments for ground-based gamma-ray astronomy are marked by a substantial increase in complexity, featuring dozens of telescopes. This leap in scale introduces significant challenges in managing system operations and offline data analysis. Methods, which depend on advanced personnel training and sophisticated software, become increasingly strained as system complexity grows, making it more challenging to effectively support users in such a multifaceted environment. To address these challenges, we propose the development of AI agents based on instruction-finetuned large language models (LLMs). These agents align with specific documentation and codebases, understand the environmental context, operate with external APIs, and communicate with humans in natural language. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of modern LLMs, which can process and retain vast amounts of information, these AI agents offer a transformative approach to system management and data analysis by automating complex tasks and providing intelligent assistance. We present two prototypes that integrate with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory pipelines for operations and offline data analysis. The first prototype automates data model implementation and maintenance for the Configuration Database of the Array Control and Data Acquisition (ACADA). The second prototype is an open-access code generation application tailored for data analysis based on the Gammapy framework.</description>

      <title>Rewarding Graph Reasoning Process makes LLMs more Generalized Reasoners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), developing advanced reasoning capabilities in LLMs remains a key challenge. Process Reward Models (PRMs) have demonstrated exceptional promise in enhancing reasoning by providing step-wise feedback, particularly in the context of mathematical reasoning. However, their application to broader reasoning domains remains understudied, largely due to the high costs associated with manually creating step-level supervision. In this work, we explore the potential of PRMs in graph reasoning problems - a domain that demands sophisticated multi-step reasoning and offers opportunities for automated step-level data generation using established graph algorithms. We introduce GraphSILO, the largest dataset for graph reasoning problems with fine-grained step-wise labels, built using automated Task-oriented Trajectories and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate detailed reasoning steps with step-wise labels. Building upon this dataset, we train GraphPRM, the first PRM designed for graph reasoning problems, and evaluate its effectiveness in two key settings: inference-time scaling and reinforcement learning via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results show that GraphPRM significantly improves LLM performance across 13 graph reasoning tasks, delivering a 9% gain for Qwen2.5-7B and demonstrating transferability to new graph reasoning datasets and new reasoning domains like mathematical problem-solving. Notably, GraphPRM enhances LLM performance on GSM8K and Math500, underscoring the cross-domain applicability of graph-based reasoning rewards. Our findings highlight the potential of PRMs in advancing reasoning across diverse domains, paving the way for more versatile and effective LLMs.</description>

      <title>MTReD: 3D Reconstruction Dataset for Fly-over Videos of Maritime Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work tackles 3D scene reconstruction for a video fly-over perspective problem in the maritime domain, with a specific emphasis on geometrically and visually sound reconstructions. This will allow for downstream tasks such as segmentation, navigation, and localization. To our knowledge, there is no dataset available in this domain. As such, we propose a novel maritime 3D scene reconstruction benchmarking dataset, named as MTReD (Maritime Three-Dimensional Reconstruction Dataset). The MTReD comprises 19 fly-over videos curated from the Internet containing ships, islands, and coastlines. As the task is aimed towards geometrical consistency and visual completeness, the dataset uses two metrics: (1) Reprojection error; and (2) Perception based metrics. We find that existing perception-based metrics, such as Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS), do not appropriately measure the completeness of a reconstructed image. Thus, we propose a novel semantic similarity metric utilizing DINOv2 features coined DiFPS (DinoV2 Features Perception Similarity). We perform initial evaluation on two baselines: (1) Structured from Motion (SfM) through Colmap; and (2) the recent state-of-the-art MASt3R model. We find that the reconstructed scenes by MASt3R have higher reprojection errors, but superior perception based metric scores. To this end, some pre-processing methods are explored, and we find a pre-processing method which improves both the reprojection error and perception-based score. We envisage our proposed MTReD to stimulate further research in these directions. The dataset and all the code will be made available in https://github.com/RuiYiYong/MTReD.</description>

      <title>Babel: Open Multilingual Large Language Models Serving Over 90% of Global Speakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), yet open-source multilingual LLMs remain scarce, with existing models often limited in language coverage. Such models typically prioritize well-resourced languages, while widely spoken but under-resourced languages are often overlooked. To address this disparity, we introduce $\texttt{Babel}$, an open multilingual LLM that covers the top 25 languages by number of speakers, supports over 90% of the global population, and includes many languages neglected by other open multilingual LLMs. Unlike traditional continue pretraining approaches, Babel expands its parameter count through a layer extension technique that elevates Babel's performance ceiling. We introduce two variants: $\texttt{Babel-9B}$, designed for efficient inference and fine-tuning, and $\texttt{Babel-83B}$, which sets a new standard for open multilingual LLMs. Extensive evaluations on multilingual tasks demonstrate its superior performance compared to open LLMs of comparable size. In addition, using open-source supervised fine-tuning datasets, Babel achieves remarkable performance, with Babel-9B-Chat leading among 10B-sized LLMs and Babel-83B-Chat setting a new standard for multilingual tasks, reaching the same level of commercial models.</description>

      <title>CyberCScope: Mining Skewed Tensor Streams and Online Anomaly Detection in Cybersecurity Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cybersecurity systems are continuously producing a huge number of time-stamped events in the form of high-order tensors, such as {count; time, port, flow duration, packet size, . . . }, and so how can we detect anomalies/intrusions in real time? How can we identify multiple types of intrusions and capture their characteristic behaviors? The tensor data consists of categorical and continuous attributes and the data distributions of continuous attributes typically exhibit skew. These data properties require handling skewed infinite and finite dimensional spaces simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel streaming method, namely CyberCScope. The method effectively decomposes incoming tensors into major trends while explicitly distinguishing between categorical and skewed continuous attributes. To our knowledge, it is the first to compute hybrid skewed infinite and finite dimensional decomposition. Based on this decomposition, it streamingly finds distinct time-evolving patterns, enabling the detection of multiple types of anomalies. Extensive experiments on large-scale real datasets demonstrate that CyberCScope detects various intrusions with higher accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while providing meaningful summaries for the intrusions that occur in practice.</description>

      <title>Evolving High-Quality Rendering and Reconstruction in a Unified Framework with Contribution-Adaptive Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representing 3D scenes from multiview images is a core challenge in computer vision and graphics, which requires both precise rendering and accurate reconstruction. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention for its high-quality rendering and fast inference speed. Yet, due to the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian point clouds, ensuring accurate geometry reconstruction remains difficult. Existing methods primarily focus on geometry regularization, with common approaches including primitive-based and dual-model frameworks. However, the former suffers from inherent conflicts between rendering and reconstruction, while the latter is computationally and storage-intensive. To address these challenges, we propose CarGS, a unified model leveraging Contribution-adaptive regularization to achieve simultaneous, high-quality rendering and surface reconstruction. The essence of our framework is learning adaptive contribution for Gaussian primitives by squeezing the knowledge from geometry regularization into a compact MLP. Additionally, we introduce a geometry-guided densification strategy with clues from both normals and Signed Distance Fields (SDF) to improve the capability of capturing high-frequency details. Our design improves the mutual learning of the two tasks, meanwhile its unified structure does not require separate models as in dual-model based approaches, guaranteeing efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the ability to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in both rendering fidelity and reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time speed and minimal storage size.</description>

      <title>Estimating Blood Pressure with a Camera: An Exploratory Study of Ambulatory Patients with Cardiovascular Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypertension is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The ability to diagnose and treat hypertension in the ambulatory population is hindered by limited access and poor adherence to current methods of monitoring blood pressure (BP), specifically, cuff-based devices. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) evaluates an individual's pulse waveform through a standard camera without physical contact. Cameras are readily available to the majority of the global population via embedded technologies such as smartphones, thus rPPG is a scalable and promising non-invasive method of BP monitoring. The few studies investigating rPPG for BP measurement have excluded high-risk populations, including those with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or its risk factors, as well as subjects in active cardiac arrhythmia. The impact of arrhythmia, like atrial fibrillation, on the prediction of BP using rPPG is currently uncertain. We performed a study to better understand the relationship between rPPG and BP in a real-world sample of ambulatory patients from a cardiology clinic with established CVD or risk factors for CVD. We collected simultaneous rPPG, PPG, BP, ECG, and other vital signs data from 143 subjects while at rest, and used this data plus demographics to train a deep learning model to predict BP. We report that facial rPPG yields a signal that is comparable to finger PPG. Pulse wave analysis (PWA)-based BP estimates on this cohort performed comparably to studies on healthier subjects, and notably, the accuracy of BP prediction in subjects with atrial fibrillation was not inferior to subjects with normal sinus rhythm. In a binary classification task, the rPPG model identified subjects with systolic BP $\geq$ 130 mm Hg with a positive predictive value of 71% (baseline prevalence 48.3%), highlighting the potential of rPPG for hypertension monitoring.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Effective Reinforcement Learning Method for Text-to-Image Diffusion Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning ( RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a powerful approach for aligning diffusion models with black-box objectives. Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is the most popular choice of method for policy optimization. While effective in terms of performance, PPO is highly sensitive to hyper-parameters and involves substantial computational overhead. REINFORCE, on the other hand, mitigates some computational complexities such as high memory overhead and sensitive hyper-parameter tuning, but has suboptimal performance due to high-variance and sample inefficiency. While the variance of the REINFORCE can be reduced by sampling multiple actions per input prompt and using a baseline correction term, it still suffers from sample inefficiency. To address these challenges, we systematically analyze the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off between REINFORCE and PPO, and propose leave-one-out PPO ( LOOP), a novel RL for diffusion fine-tuning method. LOOP combines variance reduction techniques from REINFORCE, such as sampling multiple actions per input prompt and a baseline correction term, with the robustness and sample efficiency of PPO via clipping and importance sampling. Our results demonstrate that LOOP effectively improves diffusion models on various black-box objectives, and achieves a better balance between computational efficiency and performance.</description>

      <title>S4M: S4 for multivariate time series forecasting with Missing values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate time series data play a pivotal role in a wide range of real-world applications. However, the presence of block missing data introduces significant challenges, often compromising the performance of predictive models. Traditional two-step approaches, which first impute missing values and then perform forecasting, are prone to error accumulation, particularly in complex multivariate settings characterized by high missing ratios and intricate dependency structures. In this work, we introduce S4M, an end-to-end time series forecasting framework that seamlessly integrates missing data handling into the Structured State Space Sequence (S4) model architecture. Unlike conventional methods that treat imputation as a separate preprocessing step, S4M leverages the latent space of S4 models to directly recognize and represent missing data patterns, thereby more effectively capturing the underlying temporal and multivariate dependencies. Our framework comprises two key components: the Adaptive Temporal Prototype Mapper (ATPM) and the Missing-Aware Dual Stream S4 (MDS-S4). The ATPM employs a prototype bank to derive robust and informative representations from historical data patterns, while the MDS-S4 processes these representations alongside missingness masks as dual input streams to enable accurate forecasting. Through extensive empirical evaluations on diverse real-world datasets, we demonstrate that S4M consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results underscore the efficacy of our integrated approach in handling missing data, showcasing its robustness and superiority over traditional imputation-based methods. Our findings highlight the potential of S4M to advance reliable time series forecasting in practical applications, offering a promising direction for future research and deployment.

      <title>HiBench: Benchmarking LLMs Capability on Hierarchical Structure Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structure reasoning is a fundamental capability of large language models (LLMs), enabling them to reason about structured commonsense and answer multi-hop questions. However, existing benchmarks for structure reasoning mainly focus on horizontal and coordinate structures (\emph{e.g.} graphs), overlooking the hierarchical relationships within them. Hierarchical structure reasoning is crucial for human cognition, particularly in memory organization and problem-solving. It also plays a key role in various real-world tasks, such as information extraction and decision-making. To address this gap, we propose HiBench, the first framework spanning from initial structure generation to final proficiency assessment, designed to benchmark the hierarchical reasoning capabilities of LLMs systematically. HiBench encompasses six representative scenarios, covering both fundamental and practical aspects, and consists of 30 tasks with varying hierarchical complexity, totaling 39,519 queries. To evaluate LLMs comprehensively, we develop five capability dimensions that depict different facets of hierarchical structure understanding. Through extensive evaluation of 20 LLMs from 10 model families, we reveal key insights into their capabilities and limitations: 1) existing LLMs show proficiency in basic hierarchical reasoning tasks; 2) they still struggle with more complex structures and implicit hierarchical representations, especially in structural modification and textual reasoning. Based on these findings, we create a small yet well-designed instruction dataset, which enhances LLMs' performance on HiBench by an average of 88.84\% (Llama-3.1-8B) and 31.38\% (Qwen2.5-7B) across all tasks. The HiBench dataset and toolkit are available here, https://github.com/jzzzzh/HiBench, to encourage evaluation.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Distillation-Driven Ensemble Learning for Long-Tailed Histopathology Whole Slide Images Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) plays a significant role in computational pathology, enabling weakly supervised analysis of Whole Slide Image (WSI) datasets. The field of WSI analysis is confronted with a severe long-tailed distribution problem, which significantly impacts the performance of classifiers. Long-tailed distributions lead to class imbalance, where some classes have sparse samples while others are abundant, making it difficult for classifiers to accurately identify minority class samples. To address this issue, we propose an ensemble learning method based on MIL, which employs expert decoders with shared aggregators and consistency constraints to learn diverse distributions and reduce the impact of class imbalance on classifier performance. Moreover, we introduce a multimodal distillation framework that leverages text encoders pre-trained on pathology-text pairs to distill knowledge and guide the MIL aggregator in capturing stronger semantic features relevant to class information. To ensure flexibility, we use learnable prompts to guide the distillation process of the pre-trained text encoder, avoiding limitations imposed by specific prompts. Our method, MDE-MIL, integrates multiple expert branches focusing on specific data distributions to address long-tailed issues. Consistency control ensures generalization across classes. Multimodal distillation enhances feature extraction. Experiments on Camelyon+-LT and PANDA-LT datasets show it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Behavior Preference Regression for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods aim to learn optimal policies with access only to trajectories in a fixed dataset. Policy constraint methods formulate policy learning as an optimization problem that balances maximizing reward with minimizing deviation from the behavior policy. Closed form solutions to this problem can be derived as weighted behavioral cloning objectives that, in theory, must compute an intractable partition function. Reinforcement learning has gained popularity in language modeling to align models with human preferences; some recent works consider paired completions that are ranked by a preference model following which the likelihood of the preferred completion is directly increased. We adapt this approach of paired comparison. By reformulating the paired-sample optimization problem, we fit the maximum-mode of the Q function while maximizing behavioral consistency of policy actions. This yields our algorithm, Behavior Preference Regression for offline RL (BPR). We empirically evaluate BPR on the widely used D4RL Locomotion and Antmaze datasets, as well as the more challenging V-D4RL suite, which operates in image-based state spaces. BPR demonstrates state-of-the-art performance over all domains. Our on-policy experiments suggest that BPR takes advantage of the stability of on-policy value functions with minimal perceptible performance degradation on Locomotion datasets.</description>

      <title>Improving the Transferability of Adversarial Attacks by an Input Transpose</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly susceptible to adversarial examples--subtle perturbations applied to inputs that are often imperceptible to humans yet lead to incorrect model predictions. In black-box scenarios, however, existing adversarial examples exhibit limited transferability and struggle to effectively compromise multiple unseen DNN models. Previous strategies enhance the cross-model generalization of adversarial examples by introducing versatility into adversarial perturbations, thereby improving transferability. However, further refining perturbation versatility often demands intricate algorithm development and substantial computation consumption. In this work, we propose an input transpose method that requires almost no additional labor and computation costs but can significantly improve the transferability of existing adversarial strategies. Even without adding adversarial perturbations, our method demonstrates considerable effectiveness in cross-model attacks. Our exploration finds that on specific datasets, a mere $1^\circ$ left or right rotation might be sufficient for most adversarial examples to deceive unseen models. Our further analysis suggests that this transferability improvement triggered by rotating only $1^\circ$ may stem from visible pattern shifts in the DNN's low-level feature maps. Moreover, this transferability exhibits optimal angles that, when identified under unrestricted query conditions, could potentially yield even greater performance.</description>

      <title>Can AI Model the Complexities of Human Moral Decision-Making? A Qualitative Study of Kidney Allocation Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A growing body of work in Ethical AI attempts to capture human moral judgments through simple computational models. The key question we address in this work is whether such simple AI models capture {the critical} nuances of moral decision-making by focusing on the use case of kidney allocation. We conducted twenty interviews where participants explained their rationale for their judgments about who should receive a kidney. We observe participants: (a) value patients' morally-relevant attributes to different degrees; (b) use diverse decision-making processes, citing heuristics to reduce decision complexity; (c) can change their opinions; (d) sometimes lack confidence in their decisions (e.g., due to incomplete information); and (e) express enthusiasm and concern regarding AI assisting humans in kidney allocation decisions. Based on these findings, we discuss challenges of computationally modeling moral judgments {as a stand-in for human input}, highlight drawbacks of current approaches, and suggest future directions to address these issues.</description>

      <title>Cross Modality Medical Image Synthesis for Improving Liver Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of medical images requires large datasets. However, the lack of large publicly available labeled datasets limits the development of deep learning-based CAD systems. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), in particular, CycleGAN, can be used to generate new cross-domain images without paired training data. However, most CycleGAN-based synthesis methods lack the potential to overcome alignment and asymmetry between the input and generated data. We propose a two-stage technique for the synthesis of abdominal MRI using cross-modality translation of abdominal CT. We show that the synthetic data can help improve the performance of the liver segmentation network. We increase the number of abdominal MRI images through cross-modality image transformation of unpaired CT images using a CycleGAN inspired deformation invariant network called EssNet. Subsequently, we combine the synthetic MRI images with the original MRI images and use them to improve the accuracy of the U-Net on a liver segmentation task. We train the U-Net on real MRI images and then on real and synthetic MRI images. Consequently, by comparing both scenarios, we achieve an improvement in the performance of U-Net. In summary, the improvement achieved in the Intersection over Union (IoU) is 1.17%. The results show potential to address the data scarcity challenge in medical imaging.</description>

      <title>SemViQA: A Semantic Question Answering System for Vietnamese Information Fact-Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of misinformation, exacerbated by Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT and Gemini, demands robust fact-checking solutions, especially for low-resource languages like Vietnamese. Existing methods struggle with semantic ambiguity, homonyms, and complex linguistic structures, often trading accuracy for efficiency. We introduce SemViQA, a novel Vietnamese fact-checking framework integrating Semantic-based Evidence Retrieval (SER) and Two-step Verdict Classification (TVC). Our approach balances precision and speed, achieving state-of-the-art results with 78.97\% strict accuracy on ISE-DSC01 and 80.82\% on ViWikiFC, securing 1st place in the UIT Data Science Challenge. Additionally, SemViQA Faster improves inference speed 7x while maintaining competitive accuracy. SemViQA sets a new benchmark for Vietnamese fact verification, advancing the fight against misinformation. The source code is available at: https://github.com/DAVID-NGUYEN-S16/SemViQA.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Speech Translation Systems through Targeted Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As speech translation (ST) systems become increasingly prevalent, understanding their vulnerabilities is crucial for ensuring robust and reliable communication. However, limited work has explored this issue in depth. This paper explores methods of compromising these systems through imperceptible audio manipulations. Specifically, we present two innovative approaches: (1) the injection of perturbation into source audio, and (2) the generation of adversarial music designed to guide targeted translation, while also conducting more practical over-the-air attacks in the physical world. Our experiments reveal that carefully crafted audio perturbations can mislead translation models to produce targeted, harmful outputs, while adversarial music achieve this goal more covertly, exploiting the natural imperceptibility of music. These attacks prove effective across multiple languages and translation models, highlighting a systemic vulnerability in current ST architectures. The implications of this research extend beyond immediate security concerns, shedding light on the interpretability and robustness of neural speech processing systems. Our findings underscore the need for advanced defense mechanisms and more resilient architectures in the realm of audio systems.

      <title>Using Synthetic Images to Augment Small Medical Image Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing academic and industrial interest in deep learning (DL) for medical imaging. To perform well, DL models require very large labeled datasets. However, most medical imaging datasets are small, with a limited number of annotated samples. The reason they are small is usually because delineating medical images is time-consuming and demanding for oncologists. There are various techniques that can be used to augment a dataset, for example, to apply affine transformations or elastic transformations to available images, or to add synthetic images generated by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). In this work, we have developed a novel conditional variant of a current GAN method, the StyleGAN2, to generate multi-modal high-resolution medical images with the purpose to augment small medical imaging datasets with these synthetic images. We use the synthetic and real images from six datasets to train models for the downstream task of semantic segmentation. The quality of the generated medical images and the effect of this augmentation on the segmentation performance were evaluated afterward. Finally, the results indicate that the downstream segmentation models did not benefit from the generated images. Further work and analyses are required to establish how this augmentation affects the segmentation performance.</description>

      <title>Dialogue Without Limits: Constant-Sized KV Caches for Extended Responses in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive Transformers rely on Key-Value (KV) caching to accelerate inference. However, the linear growth of the KV cache with context length leads to excessive memory consumption and bandwidth constraints. This bottleneck is particularly problematic in real-time applications -- such as chatbots and interactive assistants -- where low latency and high memory efficiency are critical. Existing methods drop distant tokens or compress states in a lossy manner, sacrificing accuracy by discarding vital context or introducing bias.
  We propose MorphKV, an inference-time technique that maintains a constant-sized KV cache while preserving accuracy. MorphKV balances long-range dependencies and local coherence during text generation. It eliminates early-token bias while retaining high-fidelity context by adaptively ranking tokens through correlation-aware selection. Unlike heuristic retention or lossy compression, MorphKV iteratively refines the KV cache via lightweight updates guided by attention patterns of recent tokens. This approach captures inter-token correlation with greater accuracy, crucial for tasks like content creation and code generation. Our studies on long-response tasks show 52.9$\%$ memory savings and 18.2$\%$ higher accuracy on average compared to state-of-the-art prior works, enabling efficient real-world deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unsupervised semantic search pipeline for the Causality-driven Adhoc Information Retrieval (CAIR-2021) shared task. The CAIR shared task expands traditional information retrieval to support the retrieval of documents containing the likely causes of a query event. A successful system must be able to distinguish between topical documents and documents containing causal descriptions of events that are causally related to the query event. Our approach involves aggregating results from multiple query strategies over a semantic and lexical index. The proposed approach leads the CAIR-2021 leaderboard and outperformed both traditional IR and pure semantic embedding-based approaches.</description>

      <title>MedUnifier: Unifying Vision-and-Language Pre-training on Medical Data with Vision Generation Task using Discrete Visual Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP), current approaches predominantly emphasize feature extraction and cross-modal comprehension, with limited attention to generating or transforming visual content. This gap hinders the model's ability to synthesize coherent and novel visual representations from textual prompts, thereby reducing the effectiveness of multi-modal learning. In this work, we propose MedUnifier, a unified VLP framework tailored for medical data. MedUnifier seamlessly integrates text-grounded image generation capabilities with multi-modal learning strategies, including image-text contrastive alignment, image-text matching and image-grounded text generation. Unlike traditional methods that reply on continuous visual representations, our approach employs visual vector quantization, which not only facilitates a more cohesive learning strategy for cross-modal understanding but also enhances multi-modal generation quality by effectively leveraging discrete representations. Our framework's effectiveness is evidenced by the experiments on established benchmarks, including uni-modal tasks (supervised fine-tuning), cross-modal tasks (image-text retrieval and zero-shot image classification), and multi-modal tasks (medical report generation, image synthesis), where it achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. MedUnifier also offers a highly adaptable tool for a wide range of language and vision tasks in healthcare, marking advancement toward the development of a generalizable AI model for medical applications.</description>

      <title>LLM-Fusion: A Novel Multimodal Fusion Model for Accelerated Material Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering materials with desirable properties in an efficient way remains a significant problem in materials science. Many studies have tackled this problem by using different sets of information available about the materials. Among them, multimodal approaches have been found to be promising because of their ability to combine different sources of information. However, fusion algorithms to date remain simple, lacking a mechanism to provide a rich representation of multiple modalities. This paper presents LLM-Fusion, a novel multimodal fusion model that leverages large language models (LLMs) to integrate diverse representations, such as SMILES, SELFIES, text descriptions, and molecular fingerprints, for accurate property prediction. Our approach introduces a flexible LLM-based architecture that supports multimodal input processing and enables material property prediction with higher accuracy than traditional methods. We validate our model on two datasets across five prediction tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to unimodal and naive concatenation baselines.</description>

      <title>Language Models Predict Empathy Gaps Between Social In-groups and Out-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies of human psychology have demonstrated that people are more motivated to extend empathy to in-group members than out-group members (Cikara et al., 2011). In this study, we investigate how this aspect of intergroup relations in humans is replicated by LLMs in an emotion intensity prediction task. In this task, the LLM is given a short description of an experience a person had that caused them to feel a particular emotion; the LLM is then prompted to predict the intensity of the emotion the person experienced on a numerical scale. By manipulating the group identities assigned to the LLM's persona (the "perceiver") and the person in the narrative (the "experiencer"), we measure how predicted emotion intensities differ between in-group and out-group settings. We observe that LLMs assign higher emotion intensity scores to in-group members than out-group members. This pattern holds across all three types of social groupings we tested: race/ethnicity, nationality, and religion. We perform an in-depth analysis on Llama-3.1-8B, the model which exhibited strongest intergroup bias among those tested.</description>

      <title>MAPS: Multi-Fidelity AI-Augmented Photonic Simulation and Inverse Design Infrastructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse design has emerged as a transformative approach for photonic device optimization, enabling the exploration of high-dimensional, non-intuitive design spaces to create ultra-compact devices and advance photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in computing and interconnects. However, practical challenges, such as suboptimal device performance, limited manufacturability, high sensitivity to variations, computational inefficiency, and lack of interpretability, have hindered its adoption in commercial hardware. Recent advancements in AI-assisted photonic simulation and design offer transformative potential, accelerating simulations and design generation by orders of magnitude over traditional numerical methods. Despite these breakthroughs, the lack of an open-source, standardized infrastructure and evaluation benchmark limits accessibility and cross-disciplinary collaboration. To address this, we introduce MAPS, a multi-fidelity AI-augmented photonic simulation and inverse design infrastructure designed to bridge this gap. MAPS features three synergistic components: (1) MAPS-Data: A dataset acquisition framework for generating multi-fidelity, richly labeled devices, providing high-quality data for AI-for-optics research. (2) MAPS-Train: A flexible AI-for-photonics training framework offering a hierarchical data loading pipeline, customizable model construction, support for data- and physics-driven losses, and comprehensive evaluations. (3) MAPS-InvDes: An advanced adjoint inverse design toolkit that abstracts complex physics but exposes flexible optimization steps, integrates pre-trained AI models, and incorporates fabrication variation models. This infrastructure MAPS provides a unified, open-source platform for developing, benchmarking, and advancing AI-assisted photonic design workflows, accelerating innovation in photonic hardware optimization and scientific machine learning.</description>

      <title>SFO: Piloting VLM Feedback for Offline RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While internet-scale image and textual data have enabled strong generalization in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the absence of internet-scale control data has impeded the development of similar generalization in standard reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Although VLMs are fundamentally limited in their ability to solve control tasks due to their lack of action-conditioned training data, their capacity for image understanding allows them to provide valuable feedback in RL tasks by recognizing successful outcomes. A key challenge in Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) is determining how best to integrate VLM-derived signals into the learning process. We explore this question in the context of offline RL and introduce a class of methods called sub-trajectory filtered optimization. We identify three key insights. First, trajectory length plays a crucial role in offline RL, as full-trajectory preference learning exacerbates the stitching problem, necessitating the use of sub-trajectories. Second, even in Markovian environments, a non-Markovian reward signal from a sequence of images is required to assess trajectory improvement, as VLMs do not interpret control actions and must rely on visual cues over time. Third, a simple yet effective approach--filtered and weighted behavior cloning--consistently outperforms more complex reinforcement learning from human feedback-based methods. We propose sub-trajectory filtered behavior cloning, a method that leverages VLM feedback on sub-trajectories while incorporating a retrospective filtering mechanism that removes sub-trajectories preceding failures to improve robustness and prevent turbulence. This study is preliminary; we provide initial evidence through evaluations on a toy control domain. Please enjoy our airport puns.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can answer questions and reason about complex tasks, also from the scientific domain. We assess several multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) on ScienceQA and find that Gemini models show the highest accuracy with little context, and the highest textual similarity to human explanations with richer context. Adapter-tuning of smaller MLLMs did not lead to any reliable performance. Training from Gemini outputs consistently underperformed training from the original data.</description>

      <title>Language-Guided Object Search in Agricultural Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating robots that can assist in farms and gardens can help reduce the mental and physical workload experienced by farm workers. We tackle the problem of object search in a farm environment, providing a method that allows a robot to semantically reason about the location of an unseen target object among a set of previously seen objects in the environment using a Large Language Model (LLM). We leverage object-to-object semantic relationships to plan a path through the environment that will allow us to accurately and efficiently locate our target object while also reducing the overall distance traveled, without needing high-level room or area-level semantic relationships. During our evaluations, we found that our method outperformed a current state-of-the-art baseline and our ablations. Our offline testing yielded an average path efficiency of 84%, reflecting how closely the predicted path aligns with the ideal path. Upon deploying our system on the Boston Dynamics Spot robot in a real-world farm environment, we found that our system had a success rate of 80%, with a success weighted by path length of 0.67, which demonstrates a reasonable trade-off between task success and path efficiency under real-world conditions.

      <title>Tackling Hallucination from Conditional Models for Medical Image Reconstruction with DynamicDPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hallucinations are spurious structures not present in the ground truth, posing a critical challenge in medical image reconstruction, especially for data-driven conditional models. We hypothesize that combining an unconditional diffusion model with data consistency, trained on a diverse dataset, can reduce these hallucinations. Based on this, we propose DynamicDPS, a diffusion-based framework that integrates conditional and unconditional diffusion models to enhance low-quality medical images while systematically reducing hallucinations. Our approach first generates an initial reconstruction using a conditional model, then refines it with an adaptive diffusion-based inverse problem solver. DynamicDPS skips early stage in the reverse process by selecting an optimal starting time point per sample and applies Wolfe's line search for adaptive step sizes, improving both efficiency and image fidelity. Using diffusion priors and data consistency, our method effectively reduces hallucinations from any conditional model output. We validate its effectiveness in Image Quality Transfer for low-field MRI enhancement. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real MR scans, including a downstream task for tissue volume estimation, show that DynamicDPS reduces hallucinations, improving relative volume estimation by over 15% for critical tissues while using only 5% of the sampling steps required by baseline diffusion models. As a model-agnostic and fine-tuning-free approach, DynamicDPS offers a robust solution for hallucination reduction in medical imaging. The code will be made publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>Depth-Adaptive Graph Neural Networks via Learnable Bakry-'Emery Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong representation learning capabilities for graph-based tasks. Recent advances on GNNs leverage geometric properties, such as curvature, to enhance its representation capabilities by modeling complex connectivity patterns and information flow within graphs. However, most existing approaches focus solely on discrete graph topology, overlooking diffusion dynamics and task-specific dependencies essential for effective learning. To address this, we propose integrating Bakry-\'Emery curvature, which captures both structural and task-driven aspects of information propagation. We develop an efficient, learnable approximation strategy, making curvature computation scalable for large graphs. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive depth mechanism that dynamically adjusts message-passing layers per vertex based on its curvature, ensuring efficient propagation. Our theoretical analysis establishes a link between curvature and feature distinctiveness, showing that high-curvature vertices require fewer layers, while low-curvature ones benefit from deeper propagation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing consistent performance improvements across diverse graph learning tasks.</description>

      <title>SolBench: A Dataset and Benchmark for Evaluating Functional Correctness in Solidity Code Completion and Repair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smart contracts are crucial programs on blockchains, and their immutability post-deployment makes functional correctness vital. Despite progress in code completion models, benchmarks for Solidity, the primary smart contract language, are lacking. Existing metrics like BLEU do not adequately assess the functional correctness of generated smart contracts. To fill this gap, we introduce SolBench, a benchmark for evaluating the functional correctness of Solidity smart contracts generated by code completion models. SolBench includes 4,178 functions from 1,155 Ethereum-deployed contracts. Testing advanced models revealed challenges in generating correct code without context, as Solidity functions rely on context-defined variables and interfaces. To address this, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Code Repair framework. In this framework, an executor verifies functional correctness, and if necessary, an LLM repairs the code using retrieved snippets informed by executor traces. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both closed-source and open-source LLMs across various model sizes and series to assess their performance in smart contract completion. The results show that code repair and retrieval techniques effectively enhance the correctness of smart contract completion while reducing computational costs.</description>

      <title>Fence Theorem: Preprocessing is Dual-Objective Semantic Structure Isolator in 3D Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D anomaly detection (AD) is prominent but difficult due to lacking a unified theoretical foundation for preprocessing design. We establish the Fence Theorem, formalizing preprocessing as a dual-objective semantic isolator: (1) mitigating cross-semantic interference to the greatest extent feasible and (2) confining anomaly judgments to aligned semantic spaces wherever viable, thereby establishing intra-semantic comparability. Any preprocessing approach achieves this goal through a two-stage process of Emantic-Division and Spatial-Constraints stage. Through systematic deconstruction, we theoretically and experimentally subsume existing preprocessing methods under this theorem via tripartite evidence: qualitative analyses, quantitative studies, and mathematical proofs. Guided by the Fence Theorem, we implement Patch3D, consisting of Patch-Cutting and Patch-Matching modules, to segment semantic spaces and consolidate similar ones while independently modeling normal features within each space. Experiments on Anomaly-ShapeNet and Real3D-AD with different settings demonstrate that progressively finer-grained semantic alignment in preprocessing directly enhances point-level AD accuracy, providing inverse validation of the theorem's causal logic.</description>

      <title>Ground contact and reaction force sensing for linear policy control of quadruped robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing robots capable of traversing uneven terrain and overcoming physical obstacles has been a longstanding challenge in the field of robotics. Walking robots show promise in this regard due to their agility, redundant DOFs and intermittent ground contact of locomoting appendages. However, the complexity of walking robots and their numerous DOFs make controlling them extremely difficult and computation heavy. Linear policies trained with reinforcement learning have been shown to perform adequately to enable quadrupedal walking, while being computationally light weight. The goal of this research is to study the effect of augmentation of observation space of a linear policy with newer state variables on performance of the policy. Since ground contact and reaction forces are the primary means of robot-environment interaction, they are essential state variables on which the linear policy must be informed. Experimental results show that augmenting the observation space with ground contact and reaction force data trains policies with better survivability, better stability against external disturbances and higher adaptability to untrained conditions.</description>

      <title>FGS-SLAM: Fourier-based Gaussian Splatting for Real-time SLAM with Sparse and Dense Map Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D gaussian splatting has advanced simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology by enabling real-time positioning and the construction of high-fidelity maps. However, the uncertainty in gaussian position and initialization parameters introduces challenges, often requiring extensive iterative convergence and resulting in redundant or insufficient gaussian representations. To address this, we introduce a novel adaptive densification method based on Fourier frequency domain analysis to establish gaussian priors for rapid convergence. Additionally, we propose constructing independent and unified sparse and dense maps, where a sparse map supports efficient tracking via Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP) and a dense map creates high-fidelity visual representations. This is the first SLAM system leveraging frequency domain analysis to achieve high-quality gaussian mapping in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate an average frame rate of 36 FPS on Replica and TUM RGB-D datasets, achieving competitive accuracy in both localization and mapping.</description>

      <title>Beyond QA Pairs: Assessing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Fact Embedding in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an extensive examination of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for embedding domain specific facts into Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on improving the fine-tuning process by categorizing question-answer (QA) pairs into Factual and Conceptual classes using a BERT-based classifier. Two distinct Llama-2 models are fine-tuned based on these classifications and evaluated using larger models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and Gemini. Our results indicate that models trained on conceptual datasets outperform those trained on factual datasets. Additionally, we compare the efficiency of two synthetic fine-tuning dataset generation techniques, D-RAG and D-Naive, with D-Naive demonstrating superior performance. Although PEFT has shown effectiveness, our research indicates that it may not be the most optimal method for embedding facts into LLMs. However, it has demonstrated exceptional performance in instruction-based tasks. Our findings are reinforced by a 1000-sample dataset in the data center domain, where the fine-tuned Llama-2 7B model significantly outperforms the baseline model in generating product recommendations. Our study highlights the importance of QA pair categorization and synthetic dataset generation techniques in enhancing the performance of LLMs in specific domains.</description>

      <title>Statistical Tractability of Off-policy Evaluation of History-dependent Policies in POMDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate off-policy evaluation (OPE), a central and fundamental problem in reinforcement learning (RL), in the challenging setting of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) with large observation spaces. Recent works of Uehara et al. (2023a); Zhang &amp; Jiang (2024) developed a model-free framework and identified important coverage assumptions (called belief and outcome coverage) that enable accurate OPE of memoryless policies with polynomial sample complexities, but handling more general target policies that depend on the entire observable history remained an open problem. In this work, we prove information-theoretic hardness for model-free OPE of history-dependent policies in several settings, characterized by additional assumptions imposed on the behavior policy (memoryless vs. history-dependent) and/or the state-revealing property of the POMDP (single-step vs. multi-step revealing). We further show that some hardness can be circumvented by a natural model-based algorithm -- whose analysis has surprisingly eluded the literature despite the algorithm's simplicity -- demonstrating provable separation between model-free and model-based OPE in POMDPs.</description>

      <title>How Well do LLMs Compress Their Own Chain-of-Thought? A Token Complexity Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought prompting has emerged as a powerful technique for enabling large language models (LLMs) to solve complex reasoning tasks. However, these reasoning chains can be verbose, raising concerns about efficiency. In response, recent works have sought to decrease response lengths through simple prompting strategies (e.g. 'be concise'). In this work, we conduct the first systematic study of the relationship between reasoning length and model performance across a diverse range of compression instructions (e.g. 'use 10 words or less' or 'remove all punctuation'). In doing so, we discover a universal tradeoff between reasoning length and accuracy that persists across even very distinct reasoning chains. We demonstrate that this tradeoff emerges from a sharp threshold behavior at the question level: each task has an intrinsic 'token complexity' - a minimal number of tokens required for successful problem-solving. We show how token complexity enables us to compute information-theoretic limits on the accuracy-compression tradeoff, and find that prompt-based compression strategies operate far from these theoretical limits. This suggests there may be significant room for improvement and our framework provides a benchmark to help researchers evaluate progress in reasoning efficiency. Our work also highlights the importance of adaptive compression -- giving shorter responses for easier questions -- and we show that token complexity is a useful tool for measuring this capability.</description>

      <title>One-shot In-context Part Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the One-shot In-context Part Segmentation (OIParts) framework, designed to tackle the challenges of part segmentation by leveraging visual foundation models (VFMs). Existing training-based one-shot part segmentation methods that utilize VFMs encounter difficulties when faced with scenarios where the one-shot image and test image exhibit significant variance in appearance and perspective, or when the object in the test image is partially visible. We argue that training on the one-shot example often leads to overfitting, thereby compromising the model's generalization capability. Our framework offers a novel approach to part segmentation that is training-free, flexible, and data-efficient, requiring only a single in-context example for precise segmentation with superior generalization ability. By thoroughly exploring the complementary strengths of VFMs, specifically DINOv2 and Stable Diffusion, we introduce an adaptive channel selection approach by minimizing the intra-class distance for better exploiting these two features, thereby enhancing the discriminatory power of the extracted features for the fine-grained parts. We have achieved remarkable segmentation performance across diverse object categories. The OIParts framework not only eliminates the need for extensive labeled data but also demonstrates superior generalization ability. Through comprehensive experimentation on three benchmark datasets, we have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed method over existing part segmentation approaches in one-shot settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the risk spillovers among AI ETFs, AI tokens, and green markets using the R2 decomposition method. We reveal several key insights. First, the overall transmission connectedness index (TCI) closely aligns with the contemporaneous TCI, while the lagged TCI is significantly lower. Second, AI ETFs and clean energy act as risk transmitters, whereas AI tokens and green bond function as risk receivers. Third, AI tokens are difficult to hedge and provide limited hedging ability compared to AI ETFs and green assets. However, multivariate portfolios effectively reduce AI tokens investment risk. Among them, the minimum correlation portfolio outperforms the minimum variance and minimum connectedness portfolios.</description>

Abstract: We present ReaderLM-v2, a compact 1.5 billion parameter language model designed for efficient web content extraction. Our model processes documents up to 512K tokens, transforming messy HTML into clean Markdown or JSON formats with high accuracy -- making it an ideal tool for grounding large language models. The model's effectiveness results from two key innovations: (1) a three-stage data synthesis pipeline that generates high quality, diverse training data by iteratively drafting, refining, and critiquing web content extraction; and (2) a unified training framework combining continuous pre-training with multi-objective optimization. Intensive evaluation demonstrates that ReaderLM-v2 outperforms GPT-4o-2024-08-06 and other larger models by 15-20\% on carefully curated benchmarks, particularly excelling at documents exceeding 100K tokens, while maintaining significantly lower computational requirements.</description>

      <title>STGAN: Spatial-temporal Graph Autoregression Network for Pavement Distress Deterioration Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pavement distress significantly compromises road integrity and poses risks to drivers. Accurate prediction of pavement distress deterioration is essential for effective road management, cost reduction in maintenance, and improvement of traffic safety. However, real-world data on pavement distress is usually collected irregularly, resulting in uneven, asynchronous, and sparse spatial-temporal datasets. This hinders the application of existing spatial-temporal models, such as DCRNN, since they are only applicable to regularly and synchronously collected data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Graph Autoregression Network (STGAN), a novel graph neural network model designed for accurately predicting irregular pavement distress deterioration using complex spatial-temporal data. Specifically, STGAN integrates the temporal domain into the spatial domain, creating a larger graph where nodes are represented by spatial-temporal tuples and edges are formed based on a similarity-based connection mechanism. Furthermore, based on the constructed spatiotemporal graph, we formulate pavement distress deterioration prediction as a graph autoregression task, i.e., the graph size increases incrementally and the prediction is performed sequentially. This is accomplished by a novel spatial-temporal attention mechanism deployed by STGAN. Utilizing the ConTrack dataset, which contains pavement distress records collected from different locations in Shanghai, we demonstrate the superior performance of STGAN in capturing spatial-temporal correlations and addressing the aforementioned challenges. Experimental results further show that STGAN outperforms baseline models, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of its novel modules. Our findings contribute to promoting proactive road maintenance decision-making and ultimately enhancing road safety and resilience.</description>

      <title>Tera-MIND: Tera-scale mouse brain simulation via spatial mRNA-guided diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holistic 3D modeling of molecularly defined brain structures is crucial for understanding complex brain functions. Emerging tissue profiling technologies enable the construction of a comprehensive atlas of the mammalian brain with sub-cellular resolution and spatially resolved gene expression data. However, such tera-scale volumetric datasets present significant computational challenges in understanding complex brain functions within their native 3D spatial context. Here, we propose the novel generative approach $\textbf{Tera-MIND}$, which can simulate $\textbf{Tera}$-scale $\textbf{M}$ouse bra$\textbf{IN}s$ in 3D using a patch-based and boundary-aware $\textbf{D}$iffusion model. Taking spatial transcriptomic data as the conditional input, we generate virtual mouse brains with comprehensive cellular morphological detail at teravoxel scale. Through the lens of 3D $gene$-$gene$ self-attention, we identify spatial molecular interactions for key transcriptomic pathways in the murine brain, exemplified by glutamatergic and dopaminergic neuronal systems. Importantly, these $in$-$silico$ biological findings are consistent and reproducible across three tera-scale virtual mouse brains. Therefore, Tera-MIND showcases a promising path toward efficient and generative simulations of whole organ systems for biomedical research.

      <title>Learning Covariance-Based Multi-Scale Representation of Neuroimaging Measures for Alzheimer Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stacking excessive layers in DNN results in highly underdetermined system when training samples are limited, which is very common in medical applications. In this regard, we present a framework capable of deriving an efficient high-dimensional space with reasonable increase in model size. This is done by utilizing a transform (i.e., convolution) that leverages scale-space theory with covariance structure. The overall model trains on this transform together with a downstream classifier (i.e., Fully Connected layer) to capture the optimal multi-scale representation of the original data which corresponds to task-specific components in a dual space. Experiments on neuroimaging measures from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study show that our model performs better and converges faster than conventional models even when the model size is significantly reduced. The trained model is made interpretable using gradient information over the multi-scale transform to delineate personalized AD-specific regions in the brain.</description>

      <title>LLM-Advisor: An LLM Benchmark for Cost-efficient Path Planning across Multiple Terrains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-terrain cost-efficient path planning is a crucial task in robot navigation, requiring the identification of a path from the start to the goal that not only avoids obstacles but also minimizes travel costs. This is especially crucial for real-world applications where robots need to navigate diverse terrains in outdoor environments, where recharging or refueling is difficult. However, there is very limited research on this topic. In this paper, we develop a prompt-based approach, LLM-Advisor, which leverages large language models (LLMs) as effective advisors for path planning. The LLM-Advisor selectively provides suggestions, demonstrating its ability to recognize when no modifications are necessary. When suggestions are made, 70.59% of the paths suggested for the A* algorithm, 69.47% for the RRT* algorithm, and 78.70% for the LLM-A* algorithm achieve greater cost efficiency. Since LLM-Advisor may occasionally lack common sense in their suggestions, we propose two hallucination-mitigation strategies. Furthermore, we experimentally verified that GPT-4o performs poorly in zero-shot path planning, even when terrain descriptions are clearly provided, demonstrating its low spatial awareness. We also experimentally demonstrate that using an LLM as an advisor is more effective than directly integrating it into the path-planning loop. Since LLMs may generate hallucinations, using LLMs in the loop of a search-based method (such as A*) may lead to a higher number of failed paths, demonstrating that our proposed LLM-Advisor is a better choice.</description>

      <title>A Taxonomy for Evaluating Generalist Robot Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning for robotics promises to unlock generalization to novel tasks and environments. Guided by this promise, many recent works have focused on scaling up robot data collection and developing larger, more expressive policies to achieve this. But how do we measure progress towards this goal of policy generalization in practice? Evaluating and quantifying generalization is the Wild West of modern robotics, with each work proposing and measuring different types of generalization in their own, often difficult to reproduce, settings. In this work, our goal is (1) to outline the forms of generalization we believe are important in robot manipulation in a comprehensive and fine-grained manner, and (2) to provide reproducible guidelines for measuring these notions of generalization. We first propose STAR-Gen, a taxonomy of generalization for robot manipulation structured around visual, semantic, and behavioral generalization. We discuss how our taxonomy encompasses most prior notions of generalization in robotics. Next, we instantiate STAR-Gen with a concrete real-world benchmark based on the widely-used Bridge V2 dataset. We evaluate a variety of state-of-the-art models on this benchmark to demonstrate the utility of our taxonomy in practice. Our taxonomy of generalization can yield many interesting insights into existing models: for example, we observe that current vision-language-action models struggle with various types of semantic generalization, despite the promise of pre-training on internet-scale language datasets. We believe STAR-Gen and our guidelines can improve the dissemination and evaluation of progress towards generalization in robotics, which we hope will guide model design and future data collection efforts. We provide videos and demos at our website stargen-taxonomy.github.io.</description>

      <title>Voice Cloning for Dysarthric Speech Synthesis: Addressing Data Scarcity in Speech-Language Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores voice cloning to generate synthetic speech replicating the unique patterns of individuals with dysarthria. Using the TORGO dataset, we address data scarcity and privacy challenges in speech-language pathology. Our contributions include demonstrating that voice cloning preserves dysarthric speech characteristics, analyzing differences between real and synthetic data, and discussing implications for diagnostics, rehabilitation, and communication. We cloned voices from dysarthric and control speakers using a commercial platform, ensuring gender-matched synthetic voices. A licensed speech-language pathologist (SLP) evaluated a subset for dysarthria, speaker gender, and synthetic indicators. The SLP correctly identified dysarthria in all cases and speaker gender in 95% but misclassified 30% of synthetic samples as real, indicating high realism. Our results suggest synthetic speech effectively captures disordered characteristics and that voice cloning has advanced to produce high-quality data resembling real speech, even to trained professionals. This has critical implications for healthcare, where synthetic data can mitigate data scarcity, protect privacy, and enhance AI-driven diagnostics. By enabling the creation of diverse, high-quality speech datasets, voice cloning can improve generalizable models, personalize therapy, and advance assistive technologies for dysarthria.
  We publicly release our synthetic dataset to foster further research and collaboration, aiming to develop robust models that improve patient outcomes in speech-language pathology.</description>

      <title>Multi-Level Collaboration in Model Merging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-level model merging is an emerging paradigm in multi-task learning with significant promise. Previous research has explored its connections with prediction-level model ensembling-commonly viewed as the upper bound for merging-to reveal the potential of achieving performance consistency between the two. However, this observation relies on certain preconditions, such as being limited to two models, using ViT-based models, and all models are fine-tuned from the same pre-trained checkpoint. To further understand the intrinsic connections between model merging and model ensembling, this paper explores an interesting possibility: If these restrictions are removed, can performance consistency still be achieved between merging and ensembling? To answer this question, we first theoretically establish a performance correlation between merging and ensembling. We find that even when previous restrictions are not met, there is still a way for model merging to attain a near-identical and superior performance similar to that of ensembling. To verify whether our findings are practical, we introduce a validation framework termed Neural Ligand (NeuLig). The learning process of NeuLig is meticulously designed with a specialized loss function supported by theoretical foundations. Experimental results demonstrate the robust resilience of NeuLig in terms of both model scale and the number of collaborating models. For instance, for the case involving 5 CLIP-ViT-B/32 models, parameter-level merging achieves the same performance as prediction-level ensembling (merging: 95.44% vs. ensembling: 95.46%).</description>

      <title>Robust Simulation-Based Inference under Missing Data via Neural Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) methods typically require fully observed data to infer parameters of models with intractable likelihood functions. However, datasets often contain missing values due to incomplete observations, data corruptions (common in astrophysics), or instrument limitations (e.g., in high-energy physics applications). In such scenarios, missing data must be imputed before applying any SBI method. We formalize the problem of missing data in SBI and demonstrate that naive imputation methods can introduce bias in the estimation of SBI posterior. We also introduce a novel amortized method that addresses this issue by jointly learning the imputation model and the inference network within a neural posterior estimation (NPE) framework. Extensive empirical results on SBI benchmarks show that our approach provides robust inference outcomes compared to standard baselines for varying levels of missing data. Moreover, we demonstrate the merits of our imputation model on two real-world bioactivity datasets (Adrenergic and Kinase assays).

      <title>ACTIVA: Amortized Causal Effect Estimation without Graphs via Transformer-based Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the distribution of outcomes under hypothetical interventions is crucial in domains like healthcare, economics, and policy-making. Current methods often rely on strong assumptions, such as known causal graphs or parametric models, and lack amortization across problem instances, limiting their practicality. We propose a novel transformer-based conditional variational autoencoder architecture, named ACTIVA, that extends causal transformer encoders to predict causal effects as mixtures of Gaussians. Our method requires no causal graph and predicts interventional distributions given only observational data and a queried intervention. By amortizing over many simulated instances, it enables zero-shot generalization to novel datasets without retraining. Experiments demonstrate accurate predictions for synthetic and semi-synthetic data, showcasing the effectiveness of our graph-free, amortized causal inference approach.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Controllable Apparel Showcase Image Generation via Garment-Centric Outpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel garment-centric outpainting (GCO) framework based on the latent diffusion model (LDM) for fine-grained controllable apparel showcase image generation. The proposed framework aims at customizing a fashion model wearing a given garment via text prompts and facial images. Different from existing methods, our framework takes a garment image segmented from a dressed mannequin or a person as the input, eliminating the need for learning cloth deformation and ensuring faithful preservation of garment details. The proposed framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, we introduce a garment-adaptive pose prediction model that generates diverse poses given the garment. Then, in the next stage, we generate apparel showcase images, conditioned on the garment and the predicted poses, along with specified text prompts and facial images. Notably, a multi-scale appearance customization module (MS-ACM) is designed to allow both overall and fine-grained text-based control over the generated model's appearance. Moreover, we leverage a lightweight feature fusion operation without introducing any extra encoders or modules to integrate multiple conditions, which is more efficient. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our framework compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>MINT: Multi-modal Chain of Thought in Unified Generative Models for Enhanced Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unified generative models have demonstrated extraordinary performance in both text and image generation. However, they tend to underperform when generating intricate images with various interwoven conditions, which is hard to solely rely on straightforward text-to-image generation. In response to this challenge, we introduce MINT, an innovative unified generative model, empowered with native multimodal chain of thought (MCoT) for enhanced image generation for the first time. Firstly, we design Mixture of Transformer Experts (MTXpert), an expert-parallel structure that effectively supports both natural language generation (NLG) and visual capabilities, while avoiding potential modality conflicts that could hinder the full potential of each modality. Building on this, we propose an innovative MCoT training paradigm, a step-by-step approach to multimodal thinking, reasoning, and reflection specifically designed to enhance image generation. This paradigm equips MINT with nuanced, element-wise decoupled alignment and a comprehensive understanding of textual and visual components. Furthermore, it fosters advanced multimodal reasoning and self-reflection, enabling the construction of images that are firmly grounded in the logical relationships between these elements. Notably, MINT has been validated to exhibit superior performance across multiple benchmarks for text-to-image (T2I) and image-to-text (I2T) tasks.</description>

      <title>From Claims to Evidence: A Unified Framework and Critical Analysis of CNN vs. Transformer vs. Mamba in Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While numerous architectures for medical image segmentation have been proposed, achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art models networks such as nnUNet, still leave room for further innovation. In this work, we introduce nnUZoo, an open source benchmarking framework built upon nnUNet, which incorporates various deep learning architectures, including CNNs, Transformers, and Mamba-based models. Using this framework, we provide a fair comparison to demystify performance claims across different medical image segmentation tasks. Additionally, in an effort to enrich the benchmarking, we explored five new architectures based on Mamba and Transformers, collectively named X2Net, and integrated them into nnUZoo for further evaluation. The proposed models combine the features of conventional U2Net, nnUNet, CNN, Transformer, and Mamba layers and architectures, called X2Net (UNETR2Net (UNETR), SwT2Net (SwinTransformer), SS2D2Net (SwinUMamba), Alt1DM2Net (LightUMamba), and MambaND2Net (MambaND)). We extensively evaluate the performance of different models on six diverse medical image segmentation datasets, including microscopy, ultrasound, CT, MRI, and PET, covering various body parts, organs, and labels. We compare their performance, in terms of dice score and computational efficiency, against their baseline models, U2Net, and nnUNet. CNN models like nnUNet and U2Net demonstrated both speed and accuracy, making them effective choices for medical image segmentation tasks. Transformer-based models, while promising for certain imaging modalities, exhibited high computational costs. Proposed Mamba-based X2Net architecture (SS2D2Net) achieved competitive accuracy with no significantly difference from nnUNet and U2Net, while using fewer parameters. However, they required significantly longer training time, highlighting a trade-off between model efficiency and computational cost.</description>

      <title>Scaling Law Phenomena Across Regression Paradigms: Multiple and Kernel Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success. A key factor behind this success is the scaling law observed by OpenAI. Specifically, for models with Transformer architecture, the test loss exhibits a power-law relationship with model size, dataset size, and the amount of computation used in training, demonstrating trends that span more than seven orders of magnitude. This scaling law challenges traditional machine learning wisdom, notably the Oscar Scissors principle, which suggests that an overparametrized algorithm will overfit the training datasets, resulting in poor test performance. Recent research has also identified the scaling law in simpler machine learning contexts, such as linear regression. However, fully explaining the scaling law in large practical models remains an elusive goal. In this work, we advance our understanding by demonstrating that the scaling law phenomenon extends to multiple regression and kernel regression settings, which are significantly more expressive and powerful than linear methods. Our analysis provides deeper insights into the scaling law, potentially enhancing our understanding of LLMs.</description>

      <title>CacheQuant: Comprehensively Accelerated Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have gradually gained prominence in the field of image synthesis, showcasing remarkable generative capabilities. Nevertheless, the slow inference and complex networks, resulting from redundancy at both temporal and structural levels, hinder their low-latency applications in real-world scenarios. Current acceleration methods for diffusion models focus separately on temporal and structural levels. However, independent optimization at each level to further push the acceleration limits results in significant performance degradation. On the other hand, integrating optimizations at both levels can compound the acceleration effects. Unfortunately, we find that the optimizations at these two levels are not entirely orthogonal. Performing separate optimizations and then simply integrating them results in unsatisfactory performance. To tackle this issue, we propose CacheQuant, a novel training-free paradigm that comprehensively accelerates diffusion models by jointly optimizing model caching and quantization techniques. Specifically, we employ a dynamic programming approach to determine the optimal cache schedule, in which the properties of caching and quantization are carefully considered to minimize errors. Additionally, we propose decoupled error correction to further mitigate the coupled and accumulated errors step by step. Experimental results show that CacheQuant achieves a 5.18 speedup and 4 compression for Stable Diffusion on MS-COCO, with only a 0.02 loss in CLIP score.

      <title>PipeOffload: Improving Scalability of Pipeline Parallelism with Memory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pipeline parallelism (PP) is widely used for training large language models (LLMs), yet its scalability is often constrained by high activation memory consumption as the number of in-flight microbatches grows with the degree of PP. In this paper, we focus on addressing this challenge by leveraging the under-explored memory offload strategy in PP. With empirical study, we discover that in the majority of standard configurations, at least half, and potentially all, of the activations can be offloaded with negligible overhead. In the cases where full overload is not possible, we introduce a novel selective offload strategy that decreases peak activation memory in a better-than-linear manner. Furthermore, we integrate memory offload with other techniques to jointly consider overall throughput and memory limitation. Our experiments proves that the per-device activation memory effectively reduces with the total number of stages, making PP a stronger alternative than TP, offering up to a 19\% acceleration with even lower memory consumption. The implementation is open-sourced at \href{https://github.com/sail-sg/zero-bubble-pipeline-parallelism}{this url}.</description>

      <title>Neural ODE Transformers: Analyzing Internal Dynamics and Adaptive Fine-tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) based on transformer architectures have sparked significant interest in understanding their inner workings. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to modeling transformer architectures using highly flexible non-autonomous neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Our proposed model parameterizes all weights of attention and feed-forward blocks through neural networks, expressing these weights as functions of a continuous layer index. Through spectral analysis of the model's dynamics, we uncover an increase in eigenvalue magnitude that challenges the weight-sharing assumption prevalent in existing theoretical studies. We also leverage the Lyapunov exponent to examine token-level sensitivity, enhancing model interpretability. Our neural ODE transformer demonstrates performance comparable to or better than vanilla transformers across various configurations and datasets, while offering flexible fine-tuning capabilities that can adapt to different architectural constraints.</description>

      <title>Answer, Refuse, or Guess? Investigating Risk-Aware Decision Making in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowing when to answer or refuse is crucial for safe and reliable decision-making language agents. Although prior work has introduced refusal strategies to boost LMs' reliability, how these models adapt their decisions to different risk levels remains underexplored. We formalize the task of risk-aware decision-making, expose critical weaknesses in existing LMs, and propose skill-decomposition solutions to mitigate them. Our findings show that even cutting-edge LMs--both regular and reasoning models--still require explicit prompt chaining to handle the task effectively, revealing the challenges that must be overcome to achieve truly autonomous decision-making agents.</description>

      <title>Same Question, Different Words: A Latent Adversarial Framework for Prompt Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Insensitivity to semantically-preserving variations of prompts (paraphrases) is crucial for reliable behavior and real-world deployment of large language models. However, language models exhibit significant performance degradation when faced with semantically equivalent but differently phrased prompts, and existing solutions either depend on trial-and-error prompt engineering or require computationally expensive inference-time algorithms. In this study, built on the key insight that worst-case prompts exhibit a drift in embedding space, we present Latent Adversarial Paraphrasing (LAP), a dual-loop adversarial framework: the inner loop trains a learnable perturbation to serve as a "latent continuous paraphrase" while preserving semantics through Lagrangian regulation, and the outer loop optimizes the language model parameters on these perturbations. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of LAP across multiple LLM architectures on the RobustAlpaca benchmark with a 0.5%-4% absolution improvement on worst-case win-rate compared with vanilla supervised fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Dendron: Enhancing Human Activity Recognition with On-Device TinyML Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) is a research field that employs Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify user activities. Recent studies have prioritized the development of HAR solutions directly executed on wearable devices, enabling the on-device activity recognition. This approach is supported by the Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) paradigm, which integrates ML within embedded devices with limited resources. However, existing approaches in the field lack in the capability for on-device learning of new HAR tasks, particularly when supervised data are scarce. To address this limitation, our paper introduces Dendron, a novel TinyML methodology designed to facilitate the on-device learning of new tasks for HAR, even in conditions of limited supervised data. Experimental results on two public-available datasets and an off-the-shelf device (STM32-NUCLEO-F401RE) show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution.</description>

      <title>SwiLTra-Bench: The Swiss Legal Translation Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Switzerland legal translation is uniquely important due to the country's four official languages and requirements for multilingual legal documentation. However, this process traditionally relies on professionals who must be both legal experts and skilled translators -- creating bottlenecks and impacting effective access to justice. To address this challenge, we introduce SwiLTra-Bench, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark of over 180K aligned Swiss legal translation pairs comprising laws, headnotes, and press releases across all Swiss languages along with English, designed to evaluate LLM-based translation systems. Our systematic evaluation reveals that frontier models achieve superior translation performance across all document types, while specialized translation systems excel specifically in laws but under-perform in headnotes. Through rigorous testing and human expert validation, we demonstrate that while fine-tuning open SLMs significantly improves their translation quality, they still lag behind the best zero-shot prompted frontier models such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Additionally, we present SwiLTra-Judge, a specialized LLM evaluation system that aligns best with human expert assessments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving Bayesian inverse problems efficiently remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of posterior distributions and the computational cost of traditional sampling methods. Given a series of observations and the forward model, we want to recover the distribution of the parameters, conditioned on observed experimental data. We show, that combining Conditional Flow Mathching (CFM) with transformer-based architecture, we can efficiently sample from such kind of distribution, conditioned on variable number of observations.</description>

      <title>Geo-Semantic-Parsing: AI-powered geoparsing by traversing semantic knowledge graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online social networks convey rich information about geospatial facets of reality. However in most cases, geographic information is not explicit and structured, thus preventing its exploitation in real-time applications. We address this limitation by introducing a novel geoparsing and geotagging technique called Geo-Semantic-Parsing (GSP). GSP identifies location references in free text and extracts the corresponding geographic coordinates. To reach this goal, we employ a semantic annotator to identify relevant portions of the input text and to link them to the corresponding entity in a knowledge graph. Then, we devise and experiment with several efficient strategies for traversing the knowledge graph, thus expanding the available set of information for the geoparsing task. Finally, we exploit all available information for learning a regression model that selects the best entity with which to geotag the input text. We evaluate GSP on a well-known reference dataset including almost 10k event-related tweets, achieving $F1=0.66$. We extensively compare our results with those of 2 baselines and 3 state-of-the-art geoparsing techniques, achieving the best performance. On the same dataset, competitors obtain $F1 \leq 0.55$. We conclude by providing in-depth analyses of our results, showing that the overall superior performance of GSP is mainly due to a large improvement in recall, with respect to existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Social Media Rumor Detection: A Semantic and Graph Neural Network Approach for the 2024 Global Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of social media platforms has revolutionized the speed and manner in which information is disseminated, leading to both beneficial and detrimental effects on society. While these platforms facilitate rapid communication, they also accelerate the spread of rumors and extremist speech, impacting public perception and behavior significantly. This issue is particularly pronounced during election periods, where the influence of social media on election outcomes has become a matter of global concern. With the unprecedented number of elections in 2024, against this backdrop, the election ecosystem has encountered unprecedented challenges. This study addresses the urgent need for effective rumor detection on social media by proposing a novel method that combines semantic analysis with graph neural networks. We have meticulously collected a dataset from PolitiFact and Twitter, focusing on politically relevant rumors. Our approach involves semantic analysis using a fine-tuned BERT model to vectorize text content and construct a directed graph where tweets and comments are nodes, and interactions are edges. The core of our method is a graph neural network, SAGEWithEdgeAttention, which extends the GraphSAGE model by incorporating first-order differences as edge attributes and applying an attention mechanism to enhance feature aggregation. This innovative approach allows for the fine-grained analysis of the complex social network structure, improving rumor detection accuracy. The study concludes that our method significantly outperforms traditional content analysis and time-based models, offering a theoretically sound and practically efficient solution.</description>

      <title>Divide and Conquer: Heterogeneous Noise Integration for Diffusion-based Adversarial Purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing diffusion-based purification methods aim to disrupt adversarial perturbations by introducing a certain amount of noise through a forward diffusion process, followed by a reverse process to recover clean examples. However, this approach is fundamentally flawed: the uniform operation of the forward process across all pixels compromises normal pixels while attempting to combat adversarial perturbations, resulting in the target model producing incorrect predictions. Simply relying on low-intensity noise is insufficient for effective defense. To address this critical issue, we implement a heterogeneous purification strategy grounded in the interpretability of neural networks. Our method decisively applies higher-intensity noise to specific pixels that the target model focuses on while the remaining pixels are subjected to only low-intensity noise. This requirement motivates us to redesign the sampling process of the diffusion model, allowing for the effective removal of varying noise levels. Furthermore, to evaluate our method against strong adaptative attack, our proposed method sharply reduces time cost and memory usage through a single-step resampling. The empirical evidence from extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrates that our method outperforms most current adversarial training and purification techniques by a substantial margin.</description>

      <title>Learning Actionable World Models for Industrial Process Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To go from (passive) process monitoring to active process control, an effective AI system must learn about the behavior of the complex system from very limited training data, forming an ad-hoc digital twin with respect to process in- and outputs that captures the consequences of actions on the process's world. We propose a novel methodology based on learning world models that disentangles process parameters in the learned latent representation, allowing for fine-grained control. Representation learning is driven by the latent factors that influence the processes through contrastive learning within a joint embedding predictive architecture. This makes changes in representations predictable from changes in inputs and vice versa, facilitating interpretability of key factors responsible for process variations, paving the way for effective control actions to keep the process within operational bounds. The effectiveness of our method is validated on the example of plastic injection molding, demonstrating practical relevance in proposing specific control actions for a notoriously unstable process.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models via Deconvolution in Subspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) is considered a milestone towards achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). With its advanced emergent capabilities, it adapt to a wide range of specific applications. Fine-tuning LLMs for various downstream tasks has become a new paradigm. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is well-known for its parameter efficiency. It can reduce the number of parameters needed to fine-tune LLMs by several orders of magnitude. However, LoRA-based approaches encounter a significant limitation due to the bottleneck imposed by rank one decomposition. As the parameters count in LLMs increase, even rank one decomposition might surpass the number of parameters truly necessary for handling more downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a new method for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) via deconvolution in subspace, dubbed as DCFT. We innovatively use deconvolution to complete details and enhance knowledge in subspace incremental matrices, and dynamically control parameters by adjusting the kernel size, unconstrained by rank-one decomposition. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of DCFT. Results show that compared to LoRA, DCFT achieve an 8$\times$ reduction in parameters, and still achieves highly impressive performance.

      <title>Sampling-Efficient Test-Time Scaling: Self-Estimating the Best-of-N Sampling in Early Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-time scaling improves large language model performance by adding extra compute during decoding. Best-of-N (BoN) sampling serves as a common scaling technique, broadening the search space for finding better solutions from the model distribution. However, traditional BoN requires N full generations, leading to high GPU memory overhead and time latency. Moreover, some methods depend on reward models, adding computational cost and limiting domain generalization.
  In this paper, we propose Self-Truncation Best-of-N (ST-BoN), a novel decoding method that avoids fully generating all samplings and eliminates the need for reward models. ST-BoN introduces early sampling consistency to estimate the most promising sample, truncating suboptimal ones to free memory and accelerate inference. This pushes the sampling-efficient test-time scaling. Compared to traditional BoN, ST-BoN can reduce dynamic GPU memory overhead by over 90% and time latency by 50%, while achieving comparable or even better performance across reasoning and open-ended domains.</description>

      <title>Eau De $Q$-Network: Adaptive Distillation of Neural Networks in Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works have successfully demonstrated that sparse deep reinforcement learning agents can be competitive against their dense counterparts. This opens up opportunities for reinforcement learning applications in fields where inference time and memory requirements are cost-sensitive or limited by hardware. Until now, dense-to-sparse methods have relied on hand-designed sparsity schedules that are not synchronized with the agent's learning pace. Crucially, the final sparsity level is chosen as a hyperparameter, which requires careful tuning as setting it too high might lead to poor performances. In this work, we address these shortcomings by crafting a dense-to-sparse algorithm that we name Eau De $Q$-Network (EauDeQN). To increase sparsity at the agent's learning pace, we consider multiple online networks with different sparsity levels, where each online network is trained from a shared target network. At each target update, the online network with the smallest loss is chosen as the next target network, while the other networks are replaced by a pruned version of the chosen network. We evaluate the proposed approach on the Atari $2600$ benchmark and the MuJoCo physics simulator, showing that EauDeQN reaches high sparsity levels while keeping performances high.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLMs for Mental Health: Detection and Recommendations from Social Discussions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Textual data from social platforms captures various aspects of mental health through discussions around and across issues, while users reach out for help and others sympathize and offer support. We propose a comprehensive framework that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI techniques to identify and assess mental health disorders, detect their severity, and create recommendations for behavior change and therapeutic interventions based on users' posts on Reddit.
  To classify the disorders, we use rule-based labeling methods as well as advanced pre-trained NLP models to extract nuanced semantic features from the data. We fine-tune domain-adapted and generic pre-trained NLP models based on predictions from specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve classification accuracy. Our hybrid approach combines the generalization capabilities of pre-trained models with the domain-specific insights captured by LLMs, providing an improved understanding of mental health discourse. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of each model, offering valuable insights into their practical applicability.
  This research potentially facilitates early detection and personalized care to aid practitioners and aims to facilitate timely interventions and improve overall well-being, thereby contributing to the broader field of mental health surveillance and digital health analytics.</description>

Abstract: We introduce POPGym Arcade, a benchmark consisting of 7 pixel-based environments each with three difficulties, utilizing a single observation and action space. Each environment offers both fully observable and partially observable variants, enabling counterfactual studies on partial observability. POPGym Arcade utilizes JIT compilation on hardware accelerators to achieve substantial speedups over CPU-bound environments. Moreover, this enables Podracer-style architectures to further increase hardware utilization and training speed. We evaluate memory models on our environments using a Podracer variant of Q learning, and examine the results. Finally, we generate memory saliency maps, uncovering how memories propagate through policies. Our library is available at https://github.com/bolt-research/ popgym_arcade.</description>

      <title>AC-Lite : A Lightweight Image Captioning Model for Low-Resource Assamese Language</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have significantly advanced AI applications, yet their real-world adoption remains constrained by high computational demands, hardware limitations, and accessibility challenges. In image captioning, many state-of-the-art models have achieved impressive performances while relying on resource-intensive architectures. This made them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained devices. This limitation is particularly noticeable for applications involving low-resource languages. We demonstrate the case of image captioning in Assamese language, where lack of effective, scalable systems can restrict the accessibility of AI-based solutions for native Assamese speakers. This work presents AC-Lite, a computationally efficient model for image captioning in low-resource Assamese language. AC-Lite reduces computational requirements by replacing computation-heavy visual feature extractors like FasterRCNN with lightweight ShuffleNetv2x1.5. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) are used as the caption decoder to further reduce computational demands and model parameters. Furthermore, the integration of bilinear attention enhances the model's overall performance. AC-Lite can operate on edge devices, thereby eliminating the need for computation on remote servers. The proposed AC-Lite model achieves 82.3 CIDEr score on the COCO-AC dataset with 1.098 GFLOPs and 25.65M parameters.</description>

      <title>Structural Deep Encoding for Table Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although Transformers-based architectures excel at processing textual information, their naive adaptation for tabular data often involves flattening the table structure. This simplification can lead to the loss of essential inter-dependencies between rows, columns, and cells, while also posing scalability challenges for large tables. To address these issues, prior works have explored special tokens, structured embeddings, and sparse attention patterns. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of tabular encoding techniques, which highlights the crucial role of attention sparsity in preserving structural information of tables. We also introduce a set of novel sparse attention mask designs for tabular data, that not only enhance computational efficiency but also preserve structural integrity, leading to better overall performance.</description>

      <title>Towards Widening The Distillation Bottleneck for Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models(LRMs) such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities by scaling test-time compute and generating long Chain-of-Thought(CoT). Distillation--post-training on LRMs-generated data--is a straightforward yet effective method to enhance the reasoning abilities of smaller models, but faces a critical bottleneck: we found that distilled long CoT data poses learning difficulty for small models and leads to the inheritance of biases (i.e. over-thinking) when using Supervised Fine-tuning(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning(RL) methods. To alleviate this bottleneck, we propose constructing tree-based CoT data from scratch via Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS). We then exploit a set of CoT-aware approaches, including Thoughts Length Balance, Fine-grained DPO, and Joint Post-training Objective, to enhance SFT and RL on the construted data.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Data: Towards Better Performing Domain-Specific Small Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) for downstream tasks, performed on domain-specific data has shown significant promise. However, commercial use of such LLMs is limited by the high computational cost required for their deployment at scale. On the other hand, small Language Models (LMs) are much more cost effective but have subpar performance in a similar setup. This paper presents our approach to finetuning a small LM, that reaches high accuracy in multiple choice question answering task. We achieve this by improving data quality at each stage of the LM training pipeline. In particular, we start with data structuring resulting in extraction of compact, semantically meaningful text chunks used by a retriever. This allows more efficient knowledge digestion by the LM. Further, we improve the retrieved context by training a lightweight Chunk Re-Ranker (CRR) that generates more accurate relative relevance chunk scores. Finally, we improve the model generalization ability by merging the models fine-tuned with different parameters on different data subsets. We present detailed procedure descriptions, and corresponding experimental findings that show the improvements of each one of the proposed techniques.</description>

      <title>Position: Ensuring mutual privacy is necessary for effective external evaluation of proprietary AI systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The external evaluation of AI systems is increasingly recognised as a crucial approach for understanding their potential risks. However, facilitating external evaluation in practice faces significant challenges in balancing evaluators' need for system access with AI developers' privacy and security concerns. Additionally, evaluators have reason to protect their own privacy - for example, in order to maintain the integrity of held-out test sets. We refer to the challenge of ensuring both developers' and evaluators' privacy as one of providing mutual privacy. In this position paper, we argue that (i) addressing this mutual privacy challenge is essential for effective external evaluation of AI systems, and (ii) current methods for facilitating external evaluation inadequately address this challenge, particularly when it comes to preserving evaluators' privacy. In making these arguments, we formalise the mutual privacy problem; examine the privacy and access requirements of both model owners and evaluators; and explore potential solutions to this challenge, including through the application of cryptographic and hardware-based approaches.</description>

      <title>SePer: Measure Retrieval Utility Through The Lens Of Semantic Perplexity Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved generation performance by incorporating externally retrieved knowledge, a process known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite the potential of this approach, existing studies evaluate RAG effectiveness by 1) assessing retrieval and generation components jointly, which obscures retrieval's distinct contribution, or 2) examining retrievers using traditional metrics such as NDCG, which creates a gap in understanding retrieval's true utility in the overall generation process. To address the above limitations, in this work, we introduce an automatic evaluation method that measures retrieval quality through the lens of information gain within the RAG framework. Specifically, we propose Semantic Perplexity (SePer), a metric that captures the LLM's internal belief about the correctness of the retrieved information. We quantify the utility of retrieval by the extent to which it reduces semantic perplexity post-retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SePer not only aligns closely with human preferences but also offers a more precise and efficient evaluation of retrieval utility across diverse RAG scenarios.</description>

      <title>Liger: Linearizing Large Language Models to Gated Recurrent Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers with linear recurrent modeling offer linear-time training and constant-memory inference. Despite their demonstrated efficiency and performance, pretraining such non-standard architectures from scratch remains costly and risky. The linearization of large language models (LLMs) transforms pretrained standard models into linear recurrent structures, enabling more efficient deployment. However, current linearization methods typically introduce additional feature map modules that require extensive fine-tuning and overlook the gating mechanisms used in state-of-the-art linear recurrent models. To address these issues, this paper presents Liger, short for Linearizing LLMs to gated recurrent structures. Liger is a novel approach for converting pretrained LLMs into gated linear recurrent models without adding extra parameters. It repurposes the pretrained key matrix weights to construct diverse gating mechanisms, facilitating the formation of various gated recurrent structures while avoiding the need to train additional components from scratch. Using lightweight fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Liger restores the performance of the linearized gated recurrent models to match that of the original LLMs. Additionally, we introduce Liger Attention, an intra-layer hybrid attention mechanism, which significantly recovers 93\% of the Transformer-based LLM at 0.02\% pre-training tokens during the linearization process, achieving competitive results across multiple benchmarks, as validated on models ranging from 1B to 8B parameters.

      <title>Lossy Neural Compression for Geospatial Analytics: A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decades, there has been an explosion in the amount of available Earth Observation (EO) data. The unprecedented coverage of the Earth's surface and atmosphere by satellite imagery has resulted in large volumes of data that must be transmitted to ground stations, stored in data centers, and distributed to end users. Modern Earth System Models (ESMs) face similar challenges, operating at high spatial and temporal resolutions, producing petabytes of data per simulated day.
  Data compression has gained relevance over the past decade, with neural compression (NC) emerging from deep learning and information theory, making EO data and ESM outputs ideal candidates due to their abundance of unlabeled data.
  In this review, we outline recent developments in NC applied to geospatial data. We introduce the fundamental concepts of NC including seminal works in its traditional applications to image and video compression domains with focus on lossy compression. We discuss the unique characteristics of EO and ESM data, contrasting them with "natural images", and explain the additional challenges and opportunities they present. Moreover, we review current applications of NC across various EO modalities and explore the limited efforts in ESM compression to date.
  The advent of self-supervised learning (SSL) and foundation models (FM) has advanced methods to efficiently distill representations from vast unlabeled data. We connect these developments to NC for EO, highlighting the similarities between the two fields and elaborate on the potential of transferring compressed feature representations for machine--to--machine communication.
  Based on insights drawn from this review, we devise future directions relevant to applications in EO and ESM.</description>

      <title>Entailment vs. Verification for Partial-assignment Satisfiability and Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many procedures for SAT-related problems, in particular for those requiring the complete enumeration of satisfying truth assignments, rely their efficiency and effectiveness on the detection of (possibly small) partial assignments satisfying an input formula. Surprisingly, there seems to be no unique universally-agreed definition of formula satisfaction by a partial assignment in the literature. In this paper we analyze in deep the issue of satisfaction by partial assignments, raising a flag about some ambiguities and subtleties of this concept, and investigating their practical consequences. We identify two alternative notions that are implicitly used in the literature, namely verification and entailment, which coincide if applied to CNF formulas but differ and present complementary properties if applied to non-CNF or to existentially-quantified formulas. We show that, although the former is easier to check and as such is implicitly used by most current search procedures, the latter has better theoretical properties, and can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of enumeration procedures.</description>

      <title>Pragmatic Inference Chain (PIC) Improving LLMs' Reasoning of Authentic Implicit Toxic Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) gives rise to ethical concerns about their performance, while opening new avenues for developing toxic language detection techniques. However, LLMs' unethical output and their capability of detecting toxicity have primarily been tested on language data that do not demand complex meaning inference, such as the biased associations of 'he' with programmer and 'she' with household. Nowadays toxic language adopts a much more creative range of implicit forms, thanks to advanced censorship. In this study, we collect authentic toxic interactions that evade online censorship and that are verified by human annotators as inference intensive. To evaluate and improve LLMs' reasoning of the authentic implicit toxic language, we propose a new prompting method, Pragmatic Inference Chain (PIC), drawn on interdisciplinary findings from cognitive science and linguistics. The PIC prompting significantly improves the success rate of GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, and DeepSeek-v2.5 in identifying implicit toxic language, compared to both direct prompting and Chain-of-Thought. In addition, it also facilitates the models to produce more explicit and coherent reasoning processes, hence can potentially be generalized to other inference-intensive tasks, e.g., understanding humour and metaphors.</description>

Abstract: Model pruning technique is vital for accelerating large language models by reducing their size and computational requirements. However, the generalizability of existing pruning methods across diverse datasets and tasks remains unclear. Thus, we conduct extensive evaluations on 24 datasets and 4 tasks using popular pruning methods. Based on these evaluations, we find and then investigate that calibration set greatly affect the performance of pruning methods. In addition, we surprisingly find a significant performance drop of existing pruning methods in sentiment classification tasks. To understand the link between performance drop and pruned neurons, we propose Neuron Semantic Attribution, which learns to associate each neuron with specific semantics. This method first makes the unpruned neurons of LLMs explainable.</description>

      <title>Compositional Reasoning with Transformers, RNNs, and Chain of Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study and compare the expressive power of transformers, RNNs, and transformers with chain of thought tokens on a simple and natural class of problems we term Compositional Reasoning Questions (CRQ). This family captures problems like evaluating Boolean formulas and multi-step word problems. Assuming standard hardness assumptions from circuit complexity and communication complexity, we prove that none of these three architectures is capable of solving CRQs unless some hyperparameter (depth, embedding dimension, and number of chain of thought tokens, respectively) grows with the size of the input. We also provide a construction for each architecture that solves CRQs. For transformers, our construction uses depth that is logarithmic in the problem size. For RNNs, logarithmic embedding dimension is necessary and sufficient, so long as the inputs are provided in a certain order. (Otherwise, a linear dimension is necessary). For transformers with chain of thought, our construction uses $n$ CoT tokens. These results show that, while CRQs are inherently hard, there are several different ways for language models to overcome this hardness. Even for a single class of problems, each architecture has strengths and weaknesses, and none is strictly better than the others.</description>

      <title>Effective High-order Graph Representation Learning for Credit Card Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Credit card fraud imposes significant costs on both cardholders and issuing banks. Fraudsters often disguise their crimes, such as using legitimate transactions through several benign users to bypass anti-fraud detection. Existing graph neural network (GNN) models struggle with learning features of camouflaged, indirect multi-hop transactions due to their inherent over-smoothing issues in deep multi-layer aggregation, presenting a major challenge in detecting disguised relationships. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel High-order Graph Representation Learning model (HOGRL) to avoid incorporating excessive noise during the multi-layer aggregation process. In particular, HOGRL learns different orders of \emph{pure} representations directly from high-order transaction graphs. We realize this goal by effectively constructing high-order transaction graphs first and then learning the \emph{pure} representations of each order so that the model could identify fraudsters' multi-hop indirect transactions via multi-layer \emph{pure} feature learning. In addition, we introduce a mixture-of-expert attention mechanism to automatically determine the importance of different orders for jointly optimizing fraud detection performance. We conduct extensive experiments in both the open source and real-world datasets, the result demonstrates the significant improvements of our proposed HOGRL compared with state-of-the-art fraud detection baselines. HOGRL's superior performance also proves its effectiveness in addressing high-order fraud camouflage criminals.</description>

      <title>MoCFL: Mobile Cluster Federated Learning Framework for Highly Dynamic Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequent fluctuations of client nodes in highly dynamic mobile clusters can lead to significant changes in feature space distribution and data drift, posing substantial challenges to the robustness of existing federated learning (FL) strategies. To address these issues, we proposed a mobile cluster federated learning framework (MoCFL). MoCFL enhances feature aggregation by introducing an affinity matrix that quantifies the similarity between local feature extractors from different clients, addressing dynamic data distribution changes caused by frequent client churn and topology changes. Additionally, MoCFL integrates historical and current feature information when training the global classifier, effectively mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem frequently encountered in mobile scenarios. This synergistic combination ensures that MoCFL maintains high performance and stability in dynamically changing mobile environments. Experimental results on the UNSW-NB15 dataset show that MoCFL excels in dynamic environments, demonstrating superior robustness and accuracy while maintaining reasonable training costs.</description>

      <title>A Selective Learning Method for Temporal Graph Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01580</link>

Abstract: Node classification is a key task in temporal graph learning (TGL). Real-life temporal graphs often introduce new node classes over time, but existing TGL methods assume a fixed set of classes. This assumption brings limitations, as updating models with full data is costly, while focusing only on new classes results in forgetting old ones. Graph continual learning (GCL) methods mitigate forgetting using old-class subsets but fail to account for their evolution. We define this novel problem as temporal graph continual learning (TGCL), which focuses on efficiently maintaining up-to-date knowledge of old classes. To tackle TGCL, we propose a selective learning framework that substitutes the old-class data with its subsets, Learning Towards the Future (LTF). We derive an upper bound on the error caused by such replacement and transform it into objectives for selecting and learning subsets that minimize classification error while preserving the distribution of the full old-class data. Experiments on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of LTF on TGCL.</description>

      <title>EliteKV: Scalable KV Cache Compression via RoPE Frequency Selection and Joint Low-Rank Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) enables each attention head to capture multi-frequency information along the sequence dimension and is widely applied in foundation models. However, the nonlinearity introduced by RoPE complicates optimization of the key state in the Key-Value (KV) cache for RoPE-based attention. Existing KV cache compression methods typically store key state before rotation and apply the transformation during decoding, introducing additional computational overhead. This paper introduces EliteKV, a flexible modification framework for RoPE-based models supporting variable KV cache compression ratios. EliteKV first identifies the intrinsic frequency preference of each head using RoPElite, selectively restoring linearity to certain dimensions of key within attention computation. Building on this, joint low-rank compression of key and value enables partial cache sharing. Experimental results show that with minimal uptraining on only $0.6\%$ of the original training data, RoPE-based models achieve a $75\%$ reduction in KV cache size while preserving performance within a negligible margin. Furthermore, EliteKV consistently performs well across models of different scales within the same family.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Approach to Detecting Lung Nodules Using Swin Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lung cancer has the highest rate of cancer-caused deaths, and early-stage diagnosis could increase the survival rate. Lung nodules are common indicators of lung cancer, making their detection crucial. Various lung nodule detection models exist, but many lack efficiency. Hence, we propose a more efficient approach by leveraging 2D CT slices, reducing computational load and complexity in training and inference. We employ the tiny version of Swin Transformer to benefit from Vision Transformers (ViT) while maintaining low computational cost. A Feature Pyramid Network is added to enhance detection, particularly for small nodules. Additionally, Transfer Learning is used to accelerate training. Our experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher mAP and mAR for small nodules by 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. Overall, our model achieves the highest mAP of 94.7% and mAR of 94.9%.</description>

      <title>STAR: Stability-Inducing Weight Perturbation for Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans can naturally learn new and varying tasks in a sequential manner. Continual learning is a class of learning algorithms that updates its learned model as it sees new data (on potentially new tasks) in a sequence. A key challenge in continual learning is that as the model is updated to learn new tasks, it becomes susceptible to catastrophic forgetting, where knowledge of previously learned tasks is lost. A popular approach to mitigate forgetting during continual learning is to maintain a small buffer of previously-seen samples and to replay them during training. However, this approach is limited by the small buffer size, and while forgetting is reduced, it is still present. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function, STAR, that exploits the worst-case parameter perturbation that reduces the KL-divergence of model predictions with that of its local parameter neighborhood to promote stability and alleviate forgetting. STAR can be combined with almost any existing rehearsal-based method as a plug-and-play component. We empirically show that STAR consistently improves the performance of existing methods by up to 15% across varying baselines and achieves superior or competitive accuracy to that of state-of-the-art methods aimed at improving rehearsal-based continual learning.</description>

      <title>Triple-Stream Deep Feature Selection with Metaheuristic Optimization and Machine Learning for Multi-Stage Hypertensive Retinopathy Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypertensive retinopathy (HR) is a severe eye disease that may cause permanent vision loss if not diagnosed early. Traditional diagnostic methods are time-consuming and subjective, highlighting the need for an automated, reliable system. Existing studies often use a single Deep Learning (DL) model, struggling to distinguish HR stages. This study introduces a three-stage approach to enhance HR diagnosis accuracy. Initially, 14 CNN models were tested, identifying DenseNet169, MobileNet, and ResNet152 as the most effective. DenseNet169 achieved 87.73% accuracy, 87.75% precision, 87.73% recall, 87.67% F1-score, and 0.8359 Cohen's Kappa. MobileNet followed with 86.40% accuracy, 86.60% precision, 86.40% recall, 86.31% F1-score, and 0.8180 Cohen's Kappa. ResNet152 ranked third with 85.87% accuracy, 86.01% precision, 85.87% recall, 85.83% F1-score, and 0.8188 Cohen's Kappa. In the second stage, deep features from these models were fused and classified using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms (SVM, RF, XGBoost). SVM (sigmoid kernel) performed best with 92.00% accuracy, 91.93% precision, 92.00% recall, 91.91% F1-score, and 0.8930 Cohen's Kappa. The third stage applied meta-heuristic optimization (GA, ABC, PSO, HHO) for feature selection. HHO yielded 94.66% accuracy, precision, and recall, 94.64% F1-score, and 0.9286 Cohen's Kappa. The proposed approach surpassed single CNN models and previous studies in HR diagnosis accuracy and generalization.</description>

      <title>Beyond Prompting: An Efficient Embedding Framework for Open-Domain Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models have recently pushed open domain question answering (ODQA) to new frontiers. However, prevailing retriever-reader pipelines often depend on multiple rounds of prompt level instructions, leading to high computational overhead, instability, and suboptimal retrieval coverage. In this paper, we propose EmbQA, an embedding-level framework that alleviates these shortcomings by enhancing both the retriever and the reader. Specifically, we refine query representations via lightweight linear layers under an unsupervised contrastive learning objective, thereby reordering retrieved passages to highlight those most likely to contain correct answers. Additionally, we introduce an exploratory embedding that broadens the model's latent semantic space to diversify candidate generation and employs an entropy-based selection mechanism to choose the most confident answer automatically. Extensive experiments across three open-source LLMs, three retrieval methods, and four ODQA benchmarks demonstrate that EmbQA substantially outperforms recent baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Advancing vision-language models in front-end development via data synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern front-end (FE) development, especially when leveraging the unique features of frameworks like React and Vue, presents distinctive challenges. These include managing modular architectures, ensuring synchronization between data and visual outputs for declarative rendering, and adapting reusable components to various scenarios. Such complexities make it particularly difficult for state-of-the-art large vision-language models (VLMs) to generate accurate and functional code directly from design images. To address these challenges, we propose a reflective agentic workflow that synthesizes high-quality image-text data to capture the diverse characteristics of FE development. This workflow automates the extraction of self-contained\footnote{A \textbf{self-contained} code snippet is one that encapsulates all necessary logic, styling, and dependencies, ensuring it functions independently without requiring external imports or context.} code snippets from real-world projects, renders the corresponding visual outputs, and generates detailed descriptions that link design elements to functional code. To further expand the scope and utility of the synthesis, we introduce three data synthesis strategies: Evolution-based synthesis, which enables scalable and diverse dataset expansion; Waterfall-Model-based synthesis, which generates logically coherent code derived from system requirements; and Additive Development synthesis, which iteratively increases the complexity of human-authored components. We build a large vision-language model, Flame, trained on the synthesized datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in generating React code via the $\text{pass}@k$ metric. Our results suggest that a code VLM trained to interpret images before code generation may achieve better performance.</description>

      <title>Machine Learners Should Acknowledge the Legal Implications of Large Language Models as Personal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Does GPT know you? The answer depends on your level of public recognition; however, if your information was available on a website, the answer is probably yes. All Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize training data to some extent. If an LLM training corpus includes personal data, it also memorizes personal data. Developing an LLM typically involves processing personal data, which falls directly within the scope of data protection laws. If a person is identified or identifiable, the implications are far-reaching: the AI system is subject to EU General Data Protection Regulation requirements even after the training phase is concluded. To back our arguments: (1.) We reiterate that LLMs output training data at inference time, be it verbatim or in generalized form. (2.) We show that some LLMs can thus be considered personal data on their own. This triggers a cascade of data protection implications such as data subject rights, including rights to access, rectification, or erasure. These rights extend to the information embedded with-in the AI model. (3.) This paper argues that machine learning researchers must acknowledge the legal implications of LLMs as personal data throughout the full ML development lifecycle, from data collection and curation to model provision on, e.g., GitHub or Hugging Face. (4.) We propose different ways for the ML research community to deal with these legal implications. Our paper serves as a starting point for improving the alignment between data protection law and the technical capabilities of LLMs. Our findings underscore the need for more interaction between the legal domain and the ML community.</description>

      <title>OpenGS-SLAM: Open-Set Dense Semantic SLAM with 3D Gaussian Splatting for Object-Level Scene Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting have significantly improved the efficiency and quality of dense semantic SLAM. However, previous methods are generally constrained by limited-category pre-trained classifiers and implicit semantic representation, which hinder their performance in open-set scenarios and restrict 3D object-level scene understanding. To address these issues, we propose OpenGS-SLAM, an innovative framework that utilizes 3D Gaussian representation to perform dense semantic SLAM in open-set environments. Our system integrates explicit semantic labels derived from 2D foundational models into the 3D Gaussian framework, facilitating robust 3D object-level scene understanding. We introduce Gaussian Voting Splatting to enable fast 2D label map rendering and scene updating. Additionally, we propose a Confidence-based 2D Label Consensus method to ensure consistent labeling across multiple views. Furthermore, we employ a Segmentation Counter Pruning strategy to improve the accuracy of semantic scene representation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in scene understanding, tracking, and mapping, achieving 10 times faster semantic rendering and 2 times lower storage costs compared to existing methods.

      <title>Distilled Prompt Learning for Incomplete Multimodal Survival Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of multimodal data including pathology images and gene profiles is widely applied in precise survival prediction. Despite recent advances in multimodal survival models, collecting complete modalities for multimodal fusion still poses a significant challenge, hindering their application in clinical settings. Current approaches tackling incomplete modalities often fall short, as they typically compensate for only a limited part of the knowledge of missing modalities. To address this issue, we propose a Distilled Prompt Learning framework (DisPro) to utilize the strong robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to missing modalities, which employs two-stage prompting for compensation of comprehensive information for missing modalities. In the first stage, Unimodal Prompting (UniPro) distills the knowledge distribution of each modality, preparing for supplementing modality-specific knowledge of the missing modality in the subsequent stage. In the second stage, Multimodal Prompting (MultiPro) leverages available modalities as prompts for LLMs to infer the missing modality, which provides modality-common information. Simultaneously, the unimodal knowledge acquired in the first stage is injected into multimodal inference to compensate for the modality-specific knowledge of the missing modality. Extensive experiments covering various missing scenarios demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/Innse/DisPro.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Object Detection Accuracy in Underwater Sonar Images through Deep Learning-based Denoising</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sonar image object detection is crucial for underwater robotics and other applications. However, various types of noise in sonar images can affect the accuracy of object detection. Denoising, as a critical preprocessing step, aims to remove noise while retaining useful information to improve detection accuracy. Although deep learning-based denoising algorithms perform well on optical images, their application to underwater sonar images remains underexplored. This paper systematically evaluates the effectiveness of several deep learning-based denoising algorithms, originally designed for optical images, in the context of underwater sonar image object detection. We apply nine trained denoising models to images from five open-source sonar datasets, each processing different types of noise. We then test the denoised images using four object detection algorithms. The results show that different denoising models have varying effects on detection performance. By combining the strengths of multiple denoising models, the detection results can be optimized, thus more effectively suppressing noise. Additionally, we adopt a multi-frame denoising technique, using different outputs generated by multiple denoising models as multiple frames of the same scene for further processing to enhance detection accuracy. This method, originally designed for optical images, leverages complementary noise-reduction effects. Experimental results show that denoised sonar images improve the performance of object detection algorithms compared to the original sonar images.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalizing large language models (LLMs) is important for aligning outputs with diverse user preferences, yet existing methods struggle with flexibility and generalization. We propose CoPL (Collaborative Preference Learning), a graph-based collaborative filtering framework that models user-response relationships to enhance preference estimation, particularly in sparse annotation settings. By integrating a mixture of LoRA experts, CoPL efficiently fine-tunes LLMs while dynamically balancing shared and user-specific preferences. Additionally, an optimization-free adaptation strategy enables generalization to unseen users without fine-tuning. Experiments on UltraFeedback-P demonstrate that CoPL outperforms existing personalized reward models, effectively capturing both common and controversial preferences, making it a scalable solution for personalized LLM alignment.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Continual Learning Framework for Multivariate Time Series Prediction Tasks with Application to Vehicle State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In continual time series analysis using neural networks, catastrophic forgetting (CF) of previously learned models when training on new data domains has always been a significant challenge. This problem is especially challenging in vehicle estimation and control, where new information is sequentially introduced to the model. Unfortunately, existing work on continual learning has not sufficiently addressed the adverse effects of catastrophic forgetting in time series analysis, particularly in multivariate output environments. In this paper, we present EM-ReSeleCT (Efficient Multivariate Representative Selection for Continual Learning in Time Series Tasks), an enhanced approach designed to handle continual learning in multivariate environments. Our approach strategically selects representative subsets from old and historical data and incorporates memory-based continual learning techniques with an improved optimization algorithm to adapt the pre-trained model on new information while preserving previously acquired information. Additionally, we develop a sequence-to-sequence transformer model (autoregressive model) specifically designed for vehicle state estimation. Moreover, we propose an uncertainty quantification framework using conformal prediction to assess the sensitivity of the memory size and to showcase the robustness of the proposed method. Experimental results from tests on an electric Equinox vehicle highlight the superiority of our method in continually learning new information while retaining prior knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art continual learning methods. Furthermore, EM-ReSeleCT significantly reduces training time, a critical advantage in continual learning applications.</description>

      <title>Evaluating LLMs' Assessment of Mixed-Context Hallucination Through the Lens of Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), LLM-as-a-judge has emerged as a widely adopted approach for text quality evaluation, including hallucination evaluation. While previous studies have focused exclusively on single-context evaluation (e.g., discourse faithfulness or world factuality), real-world hallucinations typically involve mixed contexts, which remains inadequately evaluated. In this study, we use summarization as a representative task to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' capability in detecting mixed-context hallucinations, specifically distinguishing between factual and non-factual hallucinations. Through extensive experiments across direct generation and retrieval-based models of varying scales, our main observations are: (1) LLMs' intrinsic knowledge introduces inherent biases in hallucination evaluation; (2) These biases particularly impact the detection of factual hallucinations, yielding a significant performance bottleneck; (3) The fundamental challenge lies in effective knowledge utilization, balancing between LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and external context for accurate mixed-context hallucination evaluation.</description>

      <title>Perceptual Motor Learning with Active Inference Framework for Robust Lateral Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Perceptual Motor Learning (PML) framework integrated with Active Inference (AIF) to enhance lateral control in Highly Automated Vehicles (HAVs). PML, inspired by human motor learning, emphasizes the seamless integration of perception and action, enabling efficient decision-making in dynamic environments. Traditional autonomous driving approaches--including modular pipelines, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning--struggle with adaptability, generalization, and computational efficiency. In contrast, PML with AIF leverages a generative model to minimize prediction error ("surprise") and actively shape vehicle control based on learned perceptual-motor representations. Our approach unifies deep learning with active inference principles, allowing HAVs to perform lane-keeping maneuvers with minimal data and without extensive retraining across different environments. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that PML with AIF enhances adaptability without increasing computational overhead while achieving performance comparable to conventional methods. These findings highlight the potential of PML-driven active inference as a robust alternative for real-world autonomous driving applications.</description>

      <title>Code-as-Symbolic-Planner: Foundation Model-Based Robot Planning via Symbolic Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works have shown great potentials of Large Language Models (LLMs) in robot task and motion planning (TAMP). Current LLM approaches generate text- or code-based reasoning chains with sub-goals and action plans. However, they do not fully leverage LLMs' symbolic computing and code generation capabilities. Many robot TAMP tasks involve complex optimization under multiple constraints, where pure textual reasoning is insufficient. While augmenting LLMs with predefined solvers and planners improves performance, it lacks generalization across tasks. Given LLMs' growing coding proficiency, we enhance their TAMP capabilities by steering them to generate code as symbolic planners for optimization and constraint verification. Unlike prior work that uses code to interface with robot action modules, we steer LLMs to generate code as solvers, planners, and checkers for TAMP tasks requiring symbolic computing, while still leveraging textual reasoning to incorporate common sense. With a multi-round guidance and answer evolution framework, the proposed Code-as-Symbolic-Planner improves success rates by average 24.1\% over best baseline methods across seven typical TAMP tasks and three popular LLMs. Code-as-Symbolic-Planner shows strong effectiveness and generalizability across discrete and continuous environments, 2D/3D simulations and real-world settings, as well as single- and multi-robot tasks with diverse requirements.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks are a new family of neural network architectures which holds promise for overcoming the curse of dimensionality and has interpretability benefits (arXiv:2404.19756). In this paper, we explore the connection between Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) with piecewise linear (univariate real) functions and ReLU networks. We provide completely explicit constructions to convert a piecewise linear KAN into a ReLU network and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Spark-TTS: An Efficient LLM-Based Text-to-Speech Model with Single-Stream Decoupled Speech Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have driven significant progress in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. However, existing foundation models rely on multi-stage processing or complex architectures for predicting multiple codebooks, limiting efficiency and integration flexibility. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spark-TTS, a novel system powered by BiCodec, a single-stream speech codec that decomposes speech into two complementary token types: low-bitrate semantic tokens for linguistic content and fixed-length global tokens for speaker attributes. This disentangled representation, combined with the Qwen2.5 LLM and a chain-of-thought (CoT) generation approach, enables both coarse-grained control (e.g., gender, speaking style) and fine-grained adjustments (e.g., precise pitch values, speaking rate). To facilitate research in controllable TTS, we introduce VoxBox, a meticulously curated 100,000-hour dataset with comprehensive attribute annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Spark-TTS not only achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot voice cloning but also generates highly customizable voices that surpass the limitations of reference-based synthesis. Source code, pre-trained models, and audio samples are available at https://github.com/SparkAudio/Spark-TTS.</description>

      <title>SAGE: A Framework of Precise Retrieval for RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant proficiency in conducting question-answering (QA) tasks within a specified corpus. Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved.
  In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</description>

      <title>Word Form Matters: LLMs' Semantic Reconstruction under Typoglycemia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human readers can efficiently comprehend scrambled words, a phenomenon known as Typoglycemia, primarily by relying on word form; if word form alone is insufficient, they further utilize contextual cues for interpretation. While advanced large language models (LLMs) exhibit similar abilities, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate this, we conduct controlled experiments to analyze the roles of word form and contextual information in semantic reconstruction and examine LLM attention patterns. Specifically, we first propose SemRecScore, a reliable metric to quantify the degree of semantic reconstruction, and validate its effectiveness. Using this metric, we study how word form and contextual information influence LLMs' semantic reconstruction ability, identifying word form as the core factor in this process. Furthermore, we analyze how LLMs utilize word form and find that they rely on specialized attention heads to extract and process word form information, with this mechanism remaining stable across varying levels of word scrambling. This distinction between LLMs' fixed attention patterns primarily focused on word form and human readers' adaptive strategy in balancing word form and contextual information provides insights into enhancing LLM performance by incorporating human-like, context-aware mechanisms.</description>

      <title>KeyFace: Expressive Audio-Driven Facial Animation for Long Sequences via KeyFrame Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current audio-driven facial animation methods achieve impressive results for short videos but suffer from error accumulation and identity drift when extended to longer durations. Existing methods attempt to mitigate this through external spatial control, increasing long-term consistency but compromising the naturalness of motion. We propose KeyFace, a novel two-stage diffusion-based framework, to address these issues. In the first stage, keyframes are generated at a low frame rate, conditioned on audio input and an identity frame, to capture essential facial expressions and movements over extended periods of time. In the second stage, an interpolation model fills in the gaps between keyframes, ensuring smooth transitions and temporal coherence. To further enhance realism, we incorporate continuous emotion representations and handle a wide range of non-speech vocalizations (NSVs), such as laughter and sighs. We also introduce two new evaluation metrics for assessing lip synchronization and NSV generation. Experimental results show that KeyFace outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating natural, coherent facial animations over extended durations, successfully encompassing NSVs and continuous emotions.</description>

      <title>DISCOVER: Data-driven Identification of Sub-activities via Clustering and Visualization for Enhanced Activity Recognition in Smart Homes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using ambient sensors has great potential for practical applications, particularly in elder care and independent living. However, deploying HAR systems in real-world settings remains challenging due to the high cost of labeled data, the need for pre-segmented sensor streams, and the lack of flexibility in activity granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce DISCOVER, a method designed to discover fine-grained human sub-activities from unlabeled sensor data without relying on pre-segmentation. DISCOVER combines unsupervised feature extraction and clustering with a user-friendly visualization tool to streamline the labeling process. DISCOVER enables domain experts to efficiently annotate only a minimal set of representative cluster centroids, reducing the annotation workload to a small number of samples (0.05% of our dataset). We demonstrate DISCOVER's effectiveness through a re-annotation exercise on widely used HAR datasets, showing that it uncovers finer-grained activities and produces more nuanced annotations than traditional coarse labels. DISCOVER represents a step toward practical, deployable HAR systems that adapt to diverse real environments.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Agents: Black-Box Evasion Attacks with Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) offers powerful techniques for solving complex sequential decision-making tasks from experience. In this paper, we demonstrate how RL can be applied to adversarial machine learning (AML) to develop a new class of attacks that learn to generate adversarial examples: inputs designed to fool machine learning models. Unlike traditional AML methods that craft adversarial examples independently, our RL-based approach retains and exploits past attack experience to improve future attacks. We formulate adversarial example generation as a Markov Decision Process and evaluate RL's ability to (a) learn effective and efficient attack strategies and (b) compete with state-of-the-art AML. On CIFAR-10, our agent increases the success rate of adversarial examples by 19.4% and decreases the median number of victim model queries per adversarial example by 53.2% from the start to the end of training. In a head-to-head comparison with a state-of-the-art image attack, SquareAttack, our approach enables an adversary to generate adversarial examples with 13.1% more success after 5000 episodes of training. From a security perspective, this work demonstrates a powerful new attack vector that uses RL to attack ML models efficiently and at scale.</description>

      <title>Phi-4-Mini Technical Report: Compact yet Powerful Multimodal Language Models via Mixture-of-LoRAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Phi-4-Mini and Phi-4-Multimodal, compact yet highly capable language and multimodal models. Phi-4-Mini is a 3.8-billion-parameter language model trained on high-quality web and synthetic data, significantly outperforming recent open-source models of similar size and matching the performance of models twice its size on math and coding tasks requiring complex reasoning. This achievement is driven by a carefully curated synthetic data recipe emphasizing high-quality math and coding datasets. Compared to its predecessor, Phi-3.5-Mini, Phi-4-Mini features an expanded vocabulary size of 200K tokens to better support multilingual applications, as well as group query attention for more efficient long-sequence generation. Phi-4-Multimodal is a multimodal model that integrates text, vision, and speech/audio input modalities into a single model. Its novel modality extension approach leverages LoRA adapters and modality-specific routers to allow multiple inference modes combining various modalities without interference. For example, it now ranks first in the OpenASR leaderboard to date, although the LoRA component of the speech/audio modality has just 460 million parameters. Phi-4-Multimodal supports scenarios involving (vision + language), (vision + speech), and (speech/audio) inputs, outperforming larger vision-language and speech-language models on a wide range of tasks. Additionally, we experiment to further train Phi-4-Mini to enhance its reasoning capabilities. Despite its compact 3.8-billion-parameter size, this experimental version achieves reasoning performance on par with or surpassing significantly larger models, including DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B.</description>

      <title>Zero-Trust Artificial Intelligence Model Security Based on Moving Target Defense and Content Disarm and Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the challenges in distributing AI models through model zoos and file transfer mechanisms. Despite advancements in security measures, vulnerabilities persist, necessitating a multi-layered approach to mitigate risks effectively. The physical security of model files is critical, requiring stringent access controls and attack prevention solutions. This paper proposes a novel solution architecture composed of two prevention approaches. The first is Content Disarm and Reconstruction (CDR), which focuses on disarming serialization attacks that enable attackers to run malicious code as soon as the model is loaded. The second is protecting the model architecture and weights from attacks by using Moving Target Defense (MTD), alerting the model structure, and providing verification steps to detect such attacks. The paper focuses on the highly exploitable Pickle and PyTorch file formats. It demonstrates a 100% disarm rate while validated against known AI model repositories and actual malware attacks from the HuggingFace model zoo.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Models Aren't Tool-Savvy: Benchmarking Tool Retrieval for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tool learning aims to augment large language models (LLMs) with diverse tools, enabling them to act as agents for solving practical tasks. Due to the limited context length of tool-using LLMs, adopting information retrieval (IR) models to select useful tools from large toolsets is a critical initial step. However, the performance of IR models in tool retrieval tasks remains underexplored and unclear. Most tool-use benchmarks simplify this step by manually pre-annotating a small set of relevant tools for each task, which is far from the real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose ToolRet, a heterogeneous tool retrieval benchmark comprising 7.6k diverse retrieval tasks, and a corpus of 43k tools, collected from existing datasets. We benchmark six types of models on ToolRet. Surprisingly, even the models with strong performance in conventional IR benchmarks, exhibit poor performance on ToolRet. This low retrieval quality degrades the task pass rate of tool-use LLMs. As a further step, we contribute a large-scale training dataset with over 200k instances, which substantially optimizes the tool retrieval ability of IR models.</description>

      <title>Beyond Matryoshka: Revisiting Sparse Coding for Adaptive Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many large-scale systems rely on high-quality deep representations (embeddings) to facilitate tasks like retrieval, search, and generative modeling. Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) recently emerged as a solution for adaptive embedding lengths, but it requires full model retraining and suffers from noticeable performance degradations at short lengths. In this paper, we show that sparse coding offers a compelling alternative for achieving adaptive representation with minimal overhead and higher fidelity. We propose Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR), a method that sparsifies pre-trained embeddings into a high-dimensional but selectively activated feature space. By leveraging lightweight autoencoding and task-aware contrastive objectives, CSR preserves semantic quality while allowing flexible, cost-effective inference at different sparsity levels. Extensive experiments on image, text, and multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that CSR consistently outperforms MRL in terms of both accuracy and retrieval speed-often by large margins-while also cutting training time to a fraction of that required by MRL. Our results establish sparse coding as a powerful paradigm for adaptive representation learning in real-world applications where efficiency and fidelity are both paramount.

      <title>$\texttt{SEM-CTRL}$: Semantically Controlled Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring both syntactic and semantic correctness in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs remains a significant challenge, despite being critical for real-world deployment. In this paper, we introduce $\texttt{SEM-CTRL}$, a unified approach that enforces rich context-sensitive constraints and task- and instance-specific semantics directly on an LLM decoder. Our approach integrates token-level MCTS, which is guided by specific syntactic and semantic constraints. The constraints over the desired outputs are expressed using Answer Set Grammars -- a logic-based formalism that generalizes context-sensitive grammars while incorporating background knowledge to represent task-specific semantics. We show that our approach guarantees correct completions for any off-the-shelf LLM without the need for fine-tuning. We evaluate $\texttt{SEM-CTRL}$ on a range of tasks, including synthetic grammar synthesis, combinatorial reasoning, and planning. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{SEM-CTRL}$ allows small pre-trained LLMs to efficiently outperform larger variants and state-of-the-art reasoning models (e.g., o1-preview) while simultaneously guaranteeing solution correctness.</description>

      <title>Depth-Width tradeoffs in Algorithmic Reasoning of Graph Tasks with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized the field of machine learning. In particular, they can be used to solve complex algorithmic problems, including graph-based tasks. In such algorithmic tasks a key question is what is the minimal size of a transformer that can implement a task. Recent work has begun to explore this problem for graph-based tasks, showing that for sub-linear embedding dimension (i.e., model width) logarithmic depth suffices. However, an open question, which we address here, is what happens if width is allowed to grow linearly. Here we analyze this setting, and provide the surprising result that with linear width, constant depth suffices for solving a host of graph-based problems. This suggests that a moderate increase in width can allow much shallower models, which are advantageous in terms of inference time. For other problems, we show that quadratic width is required. Our results demonstrate the complex and intriguing landscape of transformer implementations of graph-based algorithms. We support our theoretical results with empirical evaluations.</description>

      <title>AutoAdvExBench: Benchmarking autonomous exploitation of adversarial example defenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce AutoAdvExBench, a benchmark to evaluate if large language models (LLMs) can autonomously exploit defenses to adversarial examples. Unlike existing security benchmarks that often serve as proxies for real-world tasks, bench directly measures LLMs' success on tasks regularly performed by machine learning security experts. This approach offers a significant advantage: if a LLM could solve the challenges presented in bench, it would immediately present practical utility for adversarial machine learning researchers. We then design a strong agent that is capable of breaking 75% of CTF-like ("homework exercise") adversarial example defenses. However, we show that this agent is only able to succeed on 13% of the real-world defenses in our benchmark, indicating the large gap between difficulty in attacking "real" code, and CTF-like code. In contrast, a stronger LLM that can attack 21% of real defenses only succeeds on 54% of CTF-like defenses. We make this benchmark available at https://github.com/ethz-spylab/AutoAdvExBench.</description>

      <title>LLMInit: A Free Lunch from Large Language Models for Selective Initialization of Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collaborative filtering models, particularly graph-based approaches, have demonstrated strong performance in capturing user-item interactions for recommendation systems. However, they continue to struggle in cold-start and data-sparse scenarios. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like GPT and LLaMA presents new possibilities for enhancing recommendation performance, especially in cold-start settings. Despite their promise, LLMs pose challenges related to scalability and efficiency due to their high computational demands and limited ability to model complex user-item relationships effectively. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective on leveraging LLMs for CF model initialization. Through experiments, we uncover an embedding collapse issue when scaling CF models to larger embedding dimensions. To effectively harness large-scale LLM embeddings, we propose innovative selective initialization strategies utilizing random, uniform, and variance-based index sampling. Our comprehensive evaluation on multiple real-world datasets demonstrates significant performance gains across various CF models while maintaining a lower computational cost compared to existing LLM-based recommendation approaches.</description>

      <title>RSQ: Learning from Important Tokens Leads to Better Quantized LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layer-wise quantization is a key technique for efficiently compressing large models without expensive retraining. Previous methods typically quantize the weights of each layer by "uniformly" optimizing the layer reconstruction loss across all output tokens. However, in this paper, we demonstrate that better-quantized models can be obtained by prioritizing learning from important tokens (e.g. which have large attention scores). Building on this finding, we propose RSQ (Rotate, Scale, then Quantize), which (1) applies rotations (orthogonal transformation) to the model to mitigate outliers (those with exceptionally large magnitude), (2) scales the token feature based on its importance, and (3) quantizes the model using the GPTQ framework with the second-order statistics computed by scaled tokens. To compute token importance, we explore both heuristic and dynamic strategies. Based on a thorough analysis of all approaches, we adopt attention concentration, which uses attention scores of each token as its importance, as the best approach. We demonstrate that RSQ consistently outperforms baseline methods across multiple downstream tasks and three model families: LLaMA3, Mistral, and Qwen2.5. Additionally, models quantized with RSQ achieve superior performance on long-context tasks, further highlighting its effectiveness. Lastly, RSQ demonstrates generalizability across various setups, including different model sizes, calibration datasets, bit precisions, and quantization methods.</description>

      <title>Projecting Assumptions: The Duality Between Sparse Autoencoders and Concept Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are widely used to interpret neural networks by identifying meaningful concepts from their representations. However, do SAEs truly uncover all concepts a model relies on, or are they inherently biased toward certain kinds of concepts? We introduce a unified framework that recasts SAEs as solutions to a bilevel optimization problem, revealing a fundamental challenge: each SAE imposes structural assumptions about how concepts are encoded in model representations, which in turn shapes what it can and cannot detect. This means different SAEs are not interchangeable -- switching architectures can expose entirely new concepts or obscure existing ones. To systematically probe this effect, we evaluate SAEs across a spectrum of settings: from controlled toy models that isolate key variables, to semi-synthetic experiments on real model activations and finally to large-scale, naturalistic datasets. Across this progression, we examine two fundamental properties that real-world concepts often exhibit: heterogeneity in intrinsic dimensionality (some concepts are inherently low-dimensional, others are not) and nonlinear separability. We show that SAEs fail to recover concepts when these properties are ignored, and we design a new SAE that explicitly incorporates both, enabling the discovery of previously hidden concepts and reinforcing our theoretical insights. Our findings challenge the idea of a universal SAE and underscores the need for architecture-specific choices in model interpretability. Overall, we argue an SAE does not just reveal concepts -- it determines what can be seen at all.</description>

      <title>Persuade Me if You Can: A Framework for Evaluating Persuasion Effectiveness and Susceptibility Among Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate persuasive capabilities that rival human-level persuasion. While these capabilities can be used for social good, they also present risks of potential misuse. Moreover, LLMs' susceptibility to persuasion raises concerns about alignment with ethical principles. To study these dynamics, we introduce Persuade Me If You Can (PMIYC), an automated framework for evaluating persuasion through multi-agent interactions. Here, Persuader agents engage in multi-turn conversations with the Persuadee agents, allowing us to measure LLMs' persuasive effectiveness and their susceptibility to persuasion. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across diverse LLMs, ensuring each model is assessed against others in both subjective and misinformation contexts. We validate the efficacy of our framework through human evaluations and show alignment with prior work. PMIYC offers a scalable alternative to human annotation for studying persuasion in LLMs. Through PMIYC, we find that Llama-3.3-70B and GPT-4o exhibit similar persuasive effectiveness, outperforming Claude 3 Haiku by 30%. However, GPT-4o demonstrates over 50% greater resistance to persuasion for misinformation compared to Llama-3.3-70B. These findings provide empirical insights into the persuasive dynamics of LLMs and contribute to the development of safer AI systems.</description>

      <title>CrowdSelect: Synthetic Instruction Data Selection with Multi-LLM Wisdom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distilling advanced Large Language Models' instruction-following capabilities into smaller models using a selected subset has become a mainstream approach in model training. While existing synthetic instruction data selection strategies rely mainly on single-dimensional signals (i.e., reward scores, model perplexity), they fail to capture the complexity of instruction-following across diverse fields. Therefore, we investigate more diverse signals to capture comprehensive instruction-response pair characteristics and propose three foundational metrics that leverage Multi-LLM wisdom, informed by (1) diverse LLM responses and (2) reward model assessment. Building upon base metrics, we propose CrowdSelect, an integrated metric incorporating a clustering-based approach to maintain response diversity. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our foundation metrics consistently improve performance across 4 base models on MT-bench and Arena-Hard. CrowdSelect, efficiently incorporating all metrics, achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Full and LoRA fine-tuning, showing improvements of 4.81% on Arena-Hard and 11.1% on MT-bench with Llama-3.2-3b-instruct. We hope our findings will bring valuable insights for future research in this direction. Code are available at https://github.com/listentm/crowdselect.</description>

      <title>Jailbreaking Safeguarded Text-to-Image Models via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-Image models may generate harmful content, such as pornographic images, particularly when unsafe prompts are submitted. To address this issue, safety filters are often added on top of text-to-image models, or the models themselves are aligned to reduce harmful outputs. However, these defenses remain vulnerable when an attacker strategically designs adversarial prompts to bypass these safety guardrails. In this work, we propose PromptTune, a method to jailbreak text-to-image models with safety guardrails using a fine-tuned large language model. Unlike other query-based jailbreak attacks that require repeated queries to the target model, our attack generates adversarial prompts efficiently after fine-tuning our AttackLLM. We evaluate our method on three datasets of unsafe prompts and against five safety guardrails. Our results demonstrate that our approach effectively bypasses safety guardrails, outperforms existing no-box attacks, and also facilitates other query-based attacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07143v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This text is concerned with a hypothetical flavour of cognitive blindness referred to in this paper as \textit{C-Causal Blindness} or C-CB. A cognitive blindness where the policy to obtain the objective leads to the state to be avoided. A literal example of C-CB would be \textit{Kurt G\"odel's} decision to starve for \textit{"fear of being poisoned"} - take this to be premise \textbf{A}. The objective being \textit{"to avoid being poisoned (so as to not die)"}: \textbf{C}, the plan or policy being \textit{"don't eat"}: \textbf{B}, and the actual outcome having been \textit{"dying"}: $\lnot$\textbf{C} - the state that G\"odel wanted to avoid to begin with. G\"odel pursued a strategy that caused the result he wanted to avoid. An experimental computational framework is proposed to show the isomorphic relationship between C-CB in brain computations, logic, and computer computations using a new proposed algorithm: a Weighted Hidden Markov Model.</description>

      <title>Adaptive parameter sharing for multi-agent reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter sharing, as an important technique in multi-agent systems, can effectively solve the scalability issue in large-scale agent problems. However, the effectiveness of parameter sharing largely depends on the environment setting. When agents have different identities or tasks, naive parameter sharing makes it difficult to generate sufficiently differentiated strategies for agents. Inspired by research pertaining to the brain in biology, we propose a novel parameter sharing method. It maps each type of agent to different regions within a shared network based on their identity, resulting in distinct subnetworks. Therefore, our method can increase the diversity of strategies among different agents without introducing additional training parameters. Through experiments conducted in multiple environments, our method has shown better performance than other parameter sharing methods.</description>

      <title>FCoReBench: Can Large Language Models Solve Challenging First-Order Combinatorial Reasoning Problems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can the large language models (LLMs) solve challenging first-order combinatorial reasoning problems such as graph coloring, knapsack, and cryptarithmetic? By first-order, we mean these problems can be instantiated with potentially an infinite number of problem instances of varying sizes. They are also challenging being NP-hard and requiring several reasoning steps to reach a solution. While existing work has focused on coming up with datasets with hard benchmarks, there is limited work which exploits the first-order nature of the problem structure. To address this challenge, we present FCoReBench, a dataset of 40 such challenging problems, along with scripts to generate problem instances of varying sizes and automatically verify and generate their solutions. We first observe that LLMs, even when aided by symbolic solvers, perform rather poorly on our dataset, being unable to leverage the underlying structure of these problems. We specifically observe a drop in performance with increasing problem size. In response, we propose a new approach, SymPro-LM, which combines LLMs with both symbolic solvers and program interpreters, along with feedback from a few solved examples, to achieve huge performance gains. Our proposed approach is robust to changes in the problem size, and has the unique characteristic of not requiring any LLM call during inference time, unlike earlier approaches. As an additional experiment, we also demonstrate SymPro-LM's effectiveness on other logical reasoning benchmarks.</description>

      <title>SheetAgent: Towards A Generalist Agent for Spreadsheet Reasoning and Manipulation via Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spreadsheets are ubiquitous across the World Wide Web, playing a critical role in enhancing work efficiency across various domains. Large language model (LLM) has been recently attempted for automatic spreadsheet manipulation but has not yet been investigated in complicated and realistic tasks where reasoning challenges exist (e.g., long horizon manipulation with multi-step reasoning and ambiguous requirements). To bridge the gap with the real-world requirements, we introduce SheetRM, a benchmark featuring long-horizon and multi-category tasks with reasoning-dependent manipulation caused by real-life challenges. To mitigate the above challenges, we further propose SheetAgent, a novel autonomous agent that utilizes the power of LLMs. SheetAgent consists of three collaborative modules: Planner, Informer, and Retriever, achieving both advanced reasoning and accurate manipulation over spreadsheets without human interaction through iterative task reasoning and reflection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SheetAgent delivers 20--40\% pass rate improvements on multiple benchmarks over baselines, achieving enhanced precision in spreadsheet manipulation and demonstrating superior table reasoning abilities. More details and visualizations are available at the project website: https://sheetagent.github.io/. The datasets and source code are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SheetAgent.</description>

      <title>Lean Copilot: Large Language Models as Copilots for Theorem Proving in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural theorem proving combines large language models (LLMs) with proof assistants such as Lean, where the correctness of formal proofs can be rigorously verified, leaving no room for hallucination. With existing neural theorem provers pretrained on a fixed collection of data and offering valuable suggestions at times, it is challenging for them to continually prove novel theorems in a fully autonomous mode, where human insights may be critical. In this paper, we explore LLMs as copilots that assist humans in proving theorems. We introduce Lean Copilot, an general framework for running LLM inference natively in Lean. It enables programmers to build various LLM-based proof automation tools that integrate seamlessly into the workflow of Lean users. Lean users can use our pretrained models or bring their own ones that run either locally (with or without GPUs) or on the cloud. Using Lean Copilot, we build LLM-based tools that suggest proof steps, complete proof goals, and select relevant premises. Experimental results on the Mathematics in Lean textbook demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to existing rule-based proof automation in Lean (aesop). When assisting humans, Lean Copilot requires only 2.08 manually-entered proof steps on average (3.86 required by aesop); when automating the theorem proving process, Lean Copilot automates 74.2% proof steps on average, 85% better than aesop (40.1%). We open source all code and artifacts under a permissive MIT license to facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>A Second-Order Perspective on Model Compositionality and Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fine-tuning of deep pre-trained models has revealed compositional properties, with multiple specialized modules that can be arbitrarily composed into a single, multi-task model. However, identifying the conditions that promote compositionality remains an open issue, with recent efforts concentrating mainly on linearized networks. We conduct a theoretical study that attempts to demystify compositionality in standard non-linear networks through the second-order Taylor approximation of the loss function. The proposed formulation highlights the importance of staying within the pre-training basin to achieve composable modules. Moreover, it provides the basis for two dual incremental training algorithms: the one from the perspective of multiple models trained individually, while the other aims to optimize the composed model as a whole. We probe their application in incremental classification tasks and highlight some valuable skills. In fact, the pool of incrementally learned modules not only supports the creation of an effective multi-task model but also enables unlearning and specialization in certain tasks.

      <title>SORRY-Bench: Systematically Evaluating Large Language Model Safety Refusal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating aligned large language models' (LLMs) ability to recognize and reject unsafe user requests is crucial for safe, policy-compliant deployments. Existing evaluation efforts, however, face three limitations that we address with SORRY-Bench, our proposed benchmark. First, existing methods often use coarse-grained taxonomies of unsafe topics, and are over-representing some fine-grained topics. For example, among the ten existing datasets that we evaluated, tests for refusals of self-harm instructions are over 3x less represented than tests for fraudulent activities. SORRY-Bench improves on this by using a fine-grained taxonomy of 44 potentially unsafe topics, and 440 class-balanced unsafe instructions, compiled through human-in-the-loop methods. Second, linguistic characteristics and formatting of prompts are often overlooked, like different languages, dialects, and more -- which are only implicitly considered in many evaluations. We supplement SORRY-Bench with 20 diverse linguistic augmentations to systematically examine these effects. Third, existing evaluations rely on large LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) for evaluation, which can be computationally expensive. We investigate design choices for creating a fast, accurate automated safety evaluator. By collecting 7K+ human annotations and conducting a meta-evaluation of diverse LLM-as-a-judge designs, we show that fine-tuned 7B LLMs can achieve accuracy comparable to GPT-4 scale LLMs, with lower computational cost. Putting these together, we evaluate over 50 proprietary and open-weight LLMs on SORRY-Bench, analyzing their distinctive safety refusal behaviors. We hope our effort provides a building block for systematic evaluations of LLMs' safety refusal capabilities, in a balanced, granular, and efficient manner. Benchmark demo, data, code, and models are available through https://sorry-bench.github.io.</description>

      <title>Efficient Automated Circuit Discovery in Transformers using Contextual Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00886v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated mechanistic interpretation research has attracted great interest due to its potential to scale explanations of neural network internals to large models. Existing automated circuit discovery work relies on activation patching or its approximations to identify subgraphs in models for specific tasks (circuits). They often suffer from slow runtime, approximation errors, and specific requirements of metrics, such as non-zero gradients. In this work, we introduce contextual decomposition for transformers (CD-T) to build interpretable circuits in large language models. CD-T can produce circuits of arbitrary level of abstraction, and is the first able to produce circuits as fine-grained as attention heads at specific sequence positions efficiently. CD-T consists of a set of mathematical equations to isolate contribution of model features. Through recursively computing contribution of all nodes in a computational graph of a model using CD-T followed by pruning, we are able to reduce circuit discovery runtime from hours to seconds compared to state-of-the-art baselines. On three standard circuit evaluation datasets (indirect object identification, greater-than comparisons, and docstring completion), we demonstrate that CD-T outperforms ACDC and EAP by better recovering the manual circuits with an average of 97% ROC AUC under low runtimes. In addition, we provide evidence that faithfulness of CD-T circuits is not due to random chance by showing our circuits are 80% more faithful than random circuits of up to 60% of the original model size. Finally, we show CD-T circuits are able to perfectly replicate original models' behavior (faithfulness $ = 1$) using fewer nodes than the baselines for all tasks. Our results underscore the great promise of CD-T for efficient automated mechanistic interpretability, paving the way for new insights into the workings of large language models.</description>

      <title>Inference Scaling Laws: An Empirical Analysis of Compute-Optimal Inference for Problem-Solving with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the scaling laws of large language models (LLMs) training have been extensively studied, optimal inference configurations of LLMs remain underexplored. We study inference scaling laws (aka test-time scaling laws) and compute-optimal inference, focusing on the trade-offs between model sizes and generating additional tokens with different inference strategies. As a first step towards understanding and designing compute-optimal inference methods, we studied cost-performance trade-offs for inference strategies such as greedy search, majority voting, best-of-$n$, weighted voting, and two different tree search algorithms, using different model sizes and compute budgets. Our findings suggest that scaling inference compute with inference strategies can be more computationally efficient than scaling model parameters. Additionally, smaller models combined with advanced inference algorithms offer Pareto-optimal trade-offs in cost and performance. For example, the Llemma-7B model, when paired with our novel tree search algorithm, consistently outperforms the Llemma-34B model across all tested inference strategies on the MATH benchmark. We hope these insights contribute to a deeper understanding of inference scaling laws (test-time scaling laws) for LLMs.</description>

      <title>Automated Design of Agentic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Researchers are investing substantial effort in developing powerful general-purpose agents, wherein Foundation Models are used as modules within agentic systems (e.g. Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, Toolformer). However, the history of machine learning teaches us that hand-designed solutions are eventually replaced by learned solutions. We describe a newly forming research area, Automated Design of Agentic Systems (ADAS), which aims to automatically create powerful agentic system designs, including inventing novel building blocks and/or combining them in new ways. We further demonstrate that there is an unexplored yet promising approach within ADAS where agents can be defined in code and new agents can be automatically discovered by a meta agent programming ever better ones in code. Given that programming languages are Turing Complete, this approach theoretically enables the learning of any possible agentic system: including novel prompts, tool use, workflows, and combinations thereof. We present a simple yet effective algorithm named Meta Agent Search to demonstrate this idea, where a meta agent iteratively programs interesting new agents based on an ever-growing archive of previous discoveries. Through extensive experiments across multiple domains including coding, science, and math, we show that our algorithm can progressively invent agents with novel designs that greatly outperform state-of-the-art hand-designed agents. Importantly, we consistently observe the surprising result that agents invented by Meta Agent Search maintain superior performance even when transferred across domains and models, demonstrating their robustness and generality. Provided we develop it safely, our work illustrates the potential of an exciting new research direction toward automatically designing ever-more powerful agentic systems to benefit humanity.</description>

      <title>LTLf Synthesis on First-Order Agent Programs in Nondeterministic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00726v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the synthesis of policies for high-level agent programs expressed in Golog, a language based on situation calculus that incorporates nondeterministic programming constructs. Unlike traditional approaches for program realization that assume full agent control or rely on incremental search, we address scenarios where environmental nondeterminism significantly influences program outcomes. Our synthesis problem involves deriving a policy that successfully realizes a given Golog program while ensuring the satisfaction of a temporal specification, expressed in Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf), across all possible environmental behaviors. By leveraging an expressive class of first-order action theories, we construct a finite game arena that encapsulates program executions and tracks the satisfaction of the temporal goal. A game-theoretic approach is employed to derive such a policy. Experimental results demonstrate this approach's feasibility in domains with unbounded objects and non-local effects. This work bridges agent programming and temporal logic synthesis, providing a framework for robust agent behavior in nondeterministic environments.</description>

      <title>Tracking objects that change in appearance with phase synchrony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objects we encounter often change appearance as we interact with them. Changes in illumination (shadows), object pose, or the movement of non-rigid objects can drastically alter available image features. How do biological visual systems track objects as they change? One plausible mechanism involves attentional mechanisms for reasoning about the locations of objects independently of their appearances -- a capability that prominent neuroscience theories have associated with computing through neural synchrony. Here, we describe a novel deep learning circuit that can learn to precisely control attention to features separately from their location in the world through neural synchrony: the complex-valued recurrent neural network (CV-RNN). Next, we compare object tracking in humans, the CV-RNN, and other deep neural networks (DNNs), using FeatureTracker: a large-scale challenge that asks observers to track objects as their locations and appearances change in precisely controlled ways. While humans effortlessly solved FeatureTracker, state-of-the-art DNNs did not. In contrast, our CV-RNN behaved similarly to humans on the challenge, providing a computational proof-of-concept for the role of phase synchronization as a neural substrate for tracking appearance-morphing objects as they move about.</description>

      <title>Intelligence at the Edge of Chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02536v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the emergence of intelligent behavior in artificial systems by investigating how the complexity of rule-based systems influences the capabilities of models trained to predict these rules. Our study focuses on elementary cellular automata (ECA), simple yet powerful one-dimensional systems that generate behaviors ranging from trivial to highly complex. By training distinct Large Language Models (LLMs) on different ECAs, we evaluated the relationship between the complexity of the rules' behavior and the intelligence exhibited by the LLMs, as reflected in their performance on downstream tasks. Our findings reveal that rules with higher complexity lead to models exhibiting greater intelligence, as demonstrated by their performance on reasoning and chess move prediction tasks. Both uniform and periodic systems, and often also highly chaotic systems, resulted in poorer downstream performance, highlighting a sweet spot of complexity conducive to intelligence. We conjecture that intelligence arises from the ability to predict complexity and that creating intelligence may require only exposure to complexity.</description>

      <title>RainbowPO: A Unified Framework for Combining Improvements in Preference Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, numerous preference optimization algorithms have been introduced as extensions to the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) family. While these methods have successfully aligned models with human preferences, there is a lack of understanding regarding the contributions of their additional components. Moreover, fair and consistent comparisons are scarce, making it difficult to discern which components genuinely enhance downstream performance. In this work, we propose RainbowPO, a unified framework that demystifies the effectiveness of existing DPO methods by categorizing their key components into seven broad directions. We integrate these components into a single cohesive objective, enhancing the performance of each individual element. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RainbowPO outperforms existing DPO variants. Additionally, we provide insights to guide researchers in developing new DPO methods and assist practitioners in their implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biomedical reasoning integrates structured, codified knowledge with tacit, experience-driven insights. Depending on the context, quantity, and nature of available evidence, researchers and clinicians use diverse strategies, including rule-based, prototype-based, and case-based reasoning. Effective medical AI models must handle this complexity while ensuring reliability and adaptability. We introduce KGARevion, a knowledge graph-based agent that answers knowledge-intensive questions. Upon receiving a query, KGARevion generates relevant triplets by leveraging the latent knowledge embedded in a large language model. It then verifies these triplets against a grounded knowledge graph, filtering out errors and retaining only accurate, contextually relevant information for the final answer. This multi-step process strengthens reasoning, adapts to different models of medical inference, and outperforms retrieval-augmented generation-based approaches that lack effective verification mechanisms. Evaluations on medical QA benchmarks show that KGARevion improves accuracy by over 5.2% over 15 models in handling complex medical queries. To further assess its effectiveness, we curated three new medical QA datasets with varying levels of semantic complexity, where KGARevion improved accuracy by 10.4%. The agent integrates with different LLMs and biomedical knowledge graphs for broad applicability across knowledge-intensive tasks. We evaluated KGARevion on AfriMed-QA, a newly introduced dataset focused on African healthcare, demonstrating its strong zero-shot generalization to underrepresented medical contexts.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Digital World as Humans Do: Universal Visual Grounding for GUI Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are transforming the capabilities of graphical user interface (GUI) agents, facilitating their transition from controlled simulations to complex, real-world applications across various platforms. However, the effectiveness of these agents hinges on the robustness of their grounding capability. Current GUI agents predominantly utilize text-based representations such as HTML or accessibility trees, which, despite their utility, often introduce noise, incompleteness, and increased computational overhead. In this paper, we advocate a human-like embodiment for GUI agents that perceive the environment entirely visually and directly perform pixel-level operations on the GUI. The key is visual grounding models that can accurately map diverse referring expressions of GUI elements to their coordinates on the GUI across different platforms. We show that a simple recipe, which includes web-based synthetic data and slight adaptation of the LLaVA architecture, is surprisingly effective for training such visual grounding models. We collect the largest dataset for GUI visual grounding so far, containing 10M GUI elements and their referring expressions over 1.3M screenshots, and use it to train UGround, a strong universal visual grounding model for GUI agents. Empirical results on six benchmarks spanning three categories (grounding, offline agent, and online agent) show that 1) UGround substantially outperforms existing visual grounding models for GUI agents, by up to 20% absolute, and 2) agents with UGround outperform state-of-the-art agents, despite the fact that existing agents use additional text-based input while ours only uses visual perception. These results provide strong support for the feasibility and promises of GUI agents that navigate the digital world as humans do.</description>

      <title>LLMOPT: Learning to Define and Solve General Optimization Problems from Scratch</title>

Abstract: Optimization problems are prevalent across various scenarios. Formulating and then solving optimization problems described by natural language often requires highly specialized human expertise, which could block the widespread application of optimization-based decision making. To automate problem formulation and solving, leveraging large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a potential way. However, this kind of approach suffers from the issue of optimization generalization. Namely, the accuracy of most current LLM-based methods and the generality of optimization problem types that they can model are still limited. In this paper, we propose a unified learning-based framework called LLMOPT to boost optimization generalization. Starting from the natural language descriptions of optimization problems and a pre-trained LLM, LLMOPT constructs the introduced five-element formulation as a universal model for learning to define diverse optimization problem types. Then, LLMOPT employs the multi-instruction tuning to enhance both problem formalization and solver code generation accuracy and generality. After that, to prevent hallucinations in LLMs, such as sacrificing solving accuracy to avoid execution errors, the model alignment and self-correction mechanism are adopted in LLMOPT. We evaluate the optimization generalization ability of LLMOPT and compared methods across six real-world datasets covering roughly 20 fields such as health, environment, energy and manufacturing, etc. Extensive experiment results show that LLMOPT is able to model various optimization problem types such as linear/nonlinear programming, mixed integer programming, and combinatorial optimization, and achieves a notable 11.08% average solving accuracy improvement compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/caigaojiang/LLMOPT.</description>

      <title>SWE-Search: Enhancing Software Agents with Monte Carlo Tree Search and Iterative Refinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20285v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Software engineers operating in complex and dynamic environments must continuously adapt to evolving requirements, learn iteratively from experience, and reconsider their approaches based on new insights. However, current large language model (LLM)-based software agents often follow linear, sequential processes that prevent backtracking and exploration of alternative solutions, limiting their ability to rethink their strategies when initial approaches prove ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose SWE-Search, a multi-agent framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a self-improvement mechanism to enhance software agents' performance on repository-level software tasks. SWE-Search extends traditional MCTS by incorporating a hybrid value function that leverages LLMs for both numerical value estimation and qualitative evaluation. This enables self-feedback loops where agents iteratively refine their strategies based on both quantitative numerical evaluations and qualitative natural language assessments of pursued trajectories. The framework includes a SWE-Agent for adaptive exploration, a Value Agent for iterative feedback, and a Discriminator Agent that facilitates multi-agent debate for collaborative decision-making. Applied to the SWE-bench benchmark, our approach demonstrates a 23% relative improvement in performance across five models compared to standard open-source agents without MCTS. Our analysis reveals how performance scales with increased inference-time compute through deeper search, providing a pathway to improve software agents without requiring larger models or additional training data. This highlights the potential of self-evaluation driven search techniques in complex software engineering environments.</description>

Abstract: Treatment selection in breast cancer is guided by molecular subtypes and clinical characteristics. However, current tools including genomic assays lack the accuracy required for optimal clinical decision-making. We developed a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach that integrates digital pathology images with clinical data, providing a more robust and effective method for predicting the risk of cancer recurrence in breast cancer patients. Specifically, we utilized a vision transformer pan-cancer foundation model trained with self-supervised learning to extract features from digitized H&amp;E-stained slides. These features were integrated with clinical data to form a multi-modal AI test predicting cancer recurrence and death. The test was developed and evaluated using data from a total of 8,161 female breast cancer patients across 15 cohorts originating from seven countries. Of these, 3,502 patients from five cohorts were used exclusively for evaluation, while the remaining patients were used for training. Our test accurately predicted our primary endpoint, disease-free interval, in the five evaluation cohorts (C-index: 0.71 [0.68-0.75], HR: 3.63 [3.02-4.37, p&lt;0.001]). In a direct comparison (n=858), the AI test was more accurate than Oncotype DX, the standard-of-care 21-gene assay, achieving a C-index of 0.67 [0.61-0.74] versus 0.61 [0.49-0.73], respectively. Additionally, the AI test added independent prognostic information to Oncotype DX in a multivariate analysis (HR: 3.11 [1.91-5.09, p&lt;0.001)]). The test demonstrated robust accuracy across major molecular breast cancer subtypes, including TNBC (C-index: 0.71 [0.62-0.81], HR: 3.81 [2.35-6.17, p=0.02]), where no diagnostic tools are currently recommended by clinical guidelines. These results suggest that our AI test improves upon the accuracy of existing prognostic tests, while being applicable to a wider range of patients.</description>

Abstract: Broadly intelligent agents should form task-specific abstractions that selectively expose the essential elements of a task, while abstracting away the complexity of the raw sensorimotor space. In this work, we present Neuro-Symbolic Predicates, a first-order abstraction language that combines the strengths of symbolic and neural knowledge representations. We outline an online algorithm for inventing such predicates and learning abstract world models. We compare our approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning, vision-language model planning, and symbolic predicate invention approaches, on both in- and out-of-distribution tasks across five simulated robotic domains. Results show that our approach offers better sample complexity, stronger out-of-distribution generalization, and improved interpretability.</description>

      <title>CaPo: Cooperative Plan Optimization for Efficient Embodied Multi-Agent Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we address the cooperation problem among large language model (LLM) based embodied agents, where agents must cooperate to achieve a common goal. Previous methods often execute actions extemporaneously and incoherently, without long-term strategic and cooperative planning, leading to redundant steps, failures, and even serious repercussions in complex tasks like search-and-rescue missions where discussion and cooperative plan are crucial. To solve this issue, we propose Cooperative Plan Optimization (CaPo) to enhance the cooperation efficiency of LLM-based embodied agents. Inspired by human cooperation schemes, CaPo improves cooperation efficiency with two phases: 1) meta-plan generation, and 2) progress-adaptive meta-plan and execution. In the first phase, all agents analyze the task, discuss, and cooperatively create a meta-plan that decomposes the task into subtasks with detailed steps, ensuring a long-term strategic and coherent plan for efficient coordination. In the second phase, agents execute tasks according to the meta-plan and dynamically adjust it based on their latest progress (e.g., discovering a target object) through multi-turn discussions. This progress-based adaptation eliminates redundant actions, improving the overall cooperation efficiency of agents. Experimental results on the ThreeDworld Multi-Agent Transport and Communicative Watch-And-Help tasks demonstrate that CaPo achieves much higher task completion rate and efficiency compared with state-of-the-arts.The code is released at https://github.com/jliu4ai/CaPo.</description>

      <title>ChemToolAgent: The Impact of Tools on Language Agents for Chemistry Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To enhance large language models (LLMs) for chemistry problem solving, several LLM-based agents augmented with tools have been proposed, such as ChemCrow and Coscientist. However, their evaluations are narrow in scope, leaving a large gap in understanding the benefits of tools across diverse chemistry tasks. To bridge this gap, we develop ChemToolAgent, an enhanced chemistry agent over ChemCrow, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of its performance on both specialized chemistry tasks and general chemistry questions. Surprisingly, ChemToolAgent does not consistently outperform its base LLMs without tools. Our error analysis with a chemistry expert suggests that: For specialized chemistry tasks, such as synthesis prediction, we should augment agents with specialized tools; however, for general chemistry questions like those in exams, agents' ability to reason correctly with chemistry knowledge matters more, and tool augmentation does not always help.</description>

      <title>Turing Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA): A Flexible Method for Measuring Alignment Between Human and Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As we consider entrusting Large Language Models (LLMs) with key societal and decision-making roles, measuring their alignment with human cognition becomes critical. This requires methods that can assess how these systems represent information and facilitate comparisons to human understanding across diverse tasks. To meet this need, we developed Turing Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), a method that uses pairwise similarity ratings to quantify alignment between AIs and humans. We tested this approach on semantic alignment across text and image modalities, measuring how different Large Language and Vision Language Model (LLM and VLM) similarity judgments aligned with human responses at both group and individual levels. GPT-4o showed the strongest alignment with human performance among the models we tested, particularly when leveraging its text processing capabilities rather than image processing, regardless of the input modality. However, no model we studied adequately captured the inter-individual variability observed among human participants. This method helped uncover certain hyperparameters and prompts that could steer model behavior to have more or less human-like qualities at an inter-individual or group level. Turing RSA enables the efficient and flexible quantification of human-AI alignment and complements existing accuracy-based benchmark tasks. We demonstrate its utility across multiple modalities (words, sentences, images) for understanding how LLMs encode knowledge and for examining representational alignment with human cognition.</description>

      <title>Monet: Mixture of Monosemantic Experts for Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the internal computations of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for aligning them with human values and preventing undesirable behaviors like toxic content generation. However, mechanistic interpretability is hindered by polysemanticity -- where individual neurons respond to multiple, unrelated concepts. While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have attempted to disentangle these features through sparse dictionary learning, they have compromised LLM performance due to reliance on post-hoc reconstruction loss. To address this issue, we introduce Mixture of Monosemantic Experts for Transformers (Monet) architecture, which incorporates sparse dictionary learning directly into end-to-end Mixture-of-Experts pretraining. Our novel expert decomposition method enables scaling the expert count to 262,144 per layer while total parameters scale proportionally to the square root of the number of experts. Our analyses demonstrate mutual exclusivity of knowledge across experts and showcase the parametric knowledge encapsulated within individual experts. Moreover, Monet allows knowledge manipulation over domains, languages, and toxicity mitigation without degrading general performance. Our pursuit of transparent LLMs highlights the potential of scaling expert counts to enhance mechanistic interpretability and directly resect the internal knowledge to fundamentally adjust model behavior. The source code and pretrained checkpoints are available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/Monet.</description>

      <title>Dissociating Artificial Intelligence from Artificial Consciousness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developments in machine learning and computing power suggest that artificial general intelligence is within reach. This raises the question of artificial consciousness: if a computer were to be functionally equivalent to a human, being able to do all we do, would it experience sights, sounds, and thoughts, as we do when we are conscious? Answering this question in a principled manner can only be done on the basis of a theory of consciousness that is grounded in phenomenology and that states the necessary and sufficient conditions for any system, evolved or engineered, to support subjective experience. Here we employ Integrated Information Theory (IIT), which provides principled tools to determine whether a system is conscious, to what degree, and the content of its experience. We consider pairs of systems constituted of simple Boolean units, one of which -- a basic stored-program computer -- simulates the other with full functional equivalence. By applying the principles of IIT, we demonstrate that (i) two systems can be functionally equivalent without being phenomenally equivalent, and (ii) that this conclusion is not dependent on the simulated system's function. We further demonstrate that, according to IIT, it is possible for a digital computer to simulate our behavior, possibly even by simulating the neurons in our brain, without replicating our experience. This contrasts sharply with computational functionalism, the thesis that performing computations of the right kind is necessary and sufficient for consciousness.</description>

      <title>OpenReviewer: A Specialized Large Language Model for Generating Critical Scientific Paper Reviews</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present OpenReviewer, an open-source system for generating high-quality peer reviews of machine learning and AI conference papers. At its core is Llama-OpenReviewer-8B, an 8B parameter language model specifically fine-tuned on 79,000 expert reviews from top conferences. Given a PDF paper submission and review template as input, OpenReviewer extracts the full text, including technical content like equations and tables, and generates a structured review following conference-specific guidelines. Our evaluation on 400 test papers shows that OpenReviewer produces considerably more critical and realistic reviews compared to general-purpose LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude-3.5. While other LLMs tend toward overly positive assessments, OpenReviewer's recommendations closely match the distribution of human reviewer ratings. The system provides authors with rapid, constructive feedback to improve their manuscripts before submission, though it is not intended to replace human peer review. OpenReviewer is available as an online demo and open-source tool.</description>

      <title>A Multi-modal Approach to Dysarthria Detection and Severity Assessment Using Speech and Text Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic detection and severity assessment of dysarthria are crucial for delivering targeted therapeutic interventions to patients. While most existing research focuses primarily on speech modality, this study introduces a novel approach that leverages both speech and text modalities. By employing cross-attention mechanism, our method learns the acoustic and linguistic similarities between speech and text representations. This approach assesses specifically the pronunciation deviations across different severity levels, thereby enhancing the accuracy of dysarthric detection and severity assessment. All the experiments have been performed using UA-Speech dysarthric database. Improved accuracies of 99.53% and 93.20% in detection, and 98.12% and 51.97% for severity assessment have been achieved when speaker-dependent and speaker-independent, unseen and seen words settings are used. These findings suggest that by integrating text information, which provides a reference linguistic knowledge, a more robust framework has been developed for dysarthric detection and assessment, thereby potentially leading to more effective diagnoses.</description>

      <title>On the Generalization and Adaptation Ability of Machine-Generated Text Detectors in Academic Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rising popularity of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about machine-generated text (MGT), particularly in academic settings, where issues like plagiarism and misinformation are prevalent. As a result, developing a highly generalizable and adaptable MGT detection system has become an urgent priority. Given that LLMs are most commonly misused in academic writing, this work investigates the generalization and adaptation capabilities of MGT detectors in three key aspects specific to academic writing: First, we construct MGT-Acedemic, a large-scale dataset comprising over 336M tokens and 749K samples. MGT-Acedemic focuses on academic writing, featuring human-written texts (HWTs) and MGTs across STEM, Humanities, and Social Sciences, paired with an extensible code framework for efficient benchmarking. Second, we benchmark the performance of various detectors for binary classification and attribution tasks in both in-domain and cross-domain settings. This benchmark reveals the often-overlooked challenges of attribution tasks. Third, we introduce a novel attribution task where models have to adapt to new classes over time without (or with very limited) access to prior training data in both few-shot and many-shot scenarios. We implement eight different adapting techniques to improve the performance and highlight the inherent complexity of the task. Our findings provide insights into the generalization and adaptation ability of MGT detectors across diverse scenarios and lay the foundation for building robust, adaptive detection systems. The code framework is available at https://github.com/Y-L-LIU/MGTBench-2.0.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Compute: from System-1 Thinking to System-2 Thinking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The remarkable performance of the o1 model in complex reasoning demonstrates that test-time compute scaling can further unlock the model's potential, enabling powerful System-2 thinking. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive surveys for test-time compute scaling. We trace the concept of test-time compute back to System-1 models. In System-1 models, test-time compute addresses distribution shifts and improves robustness and generalization through parameter updating, input modification, representation editing, and output calibration. In System-2 models, it enhances the model's reasoning ability to solve complex problems through repeated sampling, self-correction, and tree search. We organize this survey according to the trend of System-1 to System-2 thinking, highlighting the key role of test-time compute in the transition from System-1 models to weak System-2 models, and then to strong System-2 models. We also point out a few possible future directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Healthcare systems worldwide face persistent challenges in efficiency, accessibility, and personalization. Powered by modern AI technologies such as multimodal large language models and world models, Embodied AI (EmAI) represents a transformative frontier, offering enhanced autonomy and the ability to interact with the physical world to address these challenges. As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the "brain" of EmAI for healthcare, wherein we introduce foundational AI algorithms for perception, actuation, planning, and memory, and focus on presenting the healthcare applications spanning clinical interventions, daily care &amp; companionship, infrastructure support, and biomedical research. Despite its promise, the development of EmAI for healthcare is hindered by critical challenges such as safety concerns, gaps between simulation platforms and real-world applications, the absence of standardized benchmarks, and uneven progress across interdisciplinary domains. We discuss the technical barriers and explore ethical considerations, offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of EmAI in healthcare. A hierarchical framework of intelligent levels for EmAI systems is also introduced to guide further development. By providing systematic insights, this work aims to inspire innovation and practical applications, paving the way for a new era of intelligent, patient-centered healthcare.</description>

      <title>Metastable Dynamics of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: Provable Benefits of Search, RL and Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key paradigm to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is to allocate more inference-time compute to search against a verifier or reward model. This process can then be utilized to refine the pretrained model or distill its reasoning patterns into more efficient models. In this paper, we study inference-time compute by viewing chain-of-thought (CoT) generation as a metastable Markov process: easy reasoning steps (e.g., algebraic manipulations) form densely connected clusters, while hard reasoning steps (e.g., applying a relevant theorem) create sparse, low-probability edges between clusters, leading to phase transitions at longer timescales. Under this framework, we prove that implementing a search protocol that rewards sparse edges improves CoT by decreasing the expected number of steps to reach different clusters. In contrast, we establish a limit on reasoning capability when the model is restricted to local information of the pretrained graph. We also show that the information gained by search can be utilized to obtain a better reasoning model: (1) the pretrained model can be directly finetuned to favor sparse edges via policy gradient methods, and moreover (2) a compressed metastable representation of the reasoning dynamics can be distilled into a smaller, more efficient model.</description>

      <title>Gold-medalist Performance in Solving Olympiad Geometry with AlphaGeometry2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present AlphaGeometry2, a significantly improved version of AlphaGeometry introduced in Trinh et al. (2024), which has now surpassed an average gold medalist in solving Olympiad geometry problems. To achieve this, we first extend the original AlphaGeometry language to tackle harder problems involving movements of objects, and problems containing linear equations of angles, ratios, and distances. This, together with support for non-constructive problems, has markedly improved the coverage rate of the AlphaGeometry language on International Math Olympiads (IMO) 2000-2024 geometry problems from 66% to 88%. The search process of AlphaGeometry2 has also been greatly improved through the use of Gemini architecture for better language modeling, and a novel knowledge-sharing mechanism that enables effective communication between search trees. Together with further enhancements to the symbolic engine and synthetic data generation, we have significantly boosted the overall solving rate of AlphaGeometry2 to 84% for $\textit{all}$ geometry problems over the last 25 years, compared to 54% previously. AlphaGeometry2 was also part of the system that achieved silver-medal standard at IMO 2024 https://dpmd.ai/imo-silver. Last but not least, we report progress towards using AlphaGeometry2 as a part of a fully automated system that reliably solves geometry problems directly from natural language input.</description>

      <title>Understanding LLMs' Fluid Intelligence Deficiency: An Analysis of the ARC Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While LLMs have exhibited strong performance on various NLP tasks, it is noteworthy that most of these tasks rely on utilizing the vast amount of knowledge encoded in LLMs' parameters, rather than solving new problems without prior knowledge. In cognitive research, the latter ability is referred to as fluid intelligence, which is considered to be critical for assessing human intelligence. Recent research on fluid intelligence assessments has highlighted significant deficiencies in LLMs' abilities. In this paper, we analyze the challenges LLMs face in demonstrating fluid intelligence through controlled experiments, using the most representative ARC task as an example. Our study revealed three major limitations in existing LLMs: limited ability for skill composition, unfamiliarity with abstract input formats, and the intrinsic deficiency of left-to-right decoding. Our data and code can be found in https://wujunjie1998.github.io/araoc-benchmark.github.io/.</description>

      <title>STMA: A Spatio-Temporal Memory Agent for Long-Horizon Embodied Task Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key objective of embodied intelligence is enabling agents to perform long-horizon tasks in dynamic environments while maintaining robust decision-making and adaptability. To achieve this goal, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Memory Agent (STMA), a novel framework designed to enhance task planning and execution by integrating spatio-temporal memory. STMA is built upon three critical components: (1) a spatio-temporal memory module that captures historical and environmental changes in real time, (2) a dynamic knowledge graph that facilitates adaptive spatial reasoning, and (3) a planner-critic mechanism that iteratively refines task strategies. We evaluate STMA in the TextWorld environment on 32 tasks, involving multi-step planning and exploration under varying levels of complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that STMA achieves a 31.25% improvement in success rate and a 24.7% increase in average score compared to the state-of-the-art model. The results highlight the effectiveness of spatio-temporal memory in advancing the memory capabilities of embodied agents.</description>

      <title>NavRAG: Generating User Demand Instructions for Embodied Navigation through Retrieval-Augmented LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an essential skill for embodied agents, allowing them to navigate in 3D environments following natural language instructions. High-performance navigation models require a large amount of training data, the high cost of manually annotating data has seriously hindered this field. Therefore, some previous methods translate trajectory videos into step-by-step instructions for expanding data, but such instructions do not match well with users' communication styles that briefly describe destinations or state specific needs. Moreover, local navigation trajectories overlook global context and high-level task planning. To address these issues, we propose NavRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that generates user demand instructions for VLN. NavRAG leverages LLM to build a hierarchical scene description tree for 3D scene understanding from global layout to local details, then simulates various user roles with specific demands to retrieve from the scene tree, generating diverse instructions with LLM. We annotate over 2 million navigation instructions across 861 scenes and evaluate the data quality and navigation performance of trained models.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Dual Process Theory in Language Agent Framework for Real-time Simultaneous Human-AI Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agents built on large language models (LLMs) have excelled in turn-by-turn human-AI collaboration but struggle with simultaneous tasks requiring real-time interaction. Latency issues and the challenge of inferring variable human strategies hinder their ability to make autonomous decisions without explicit instructions. Through experiments with current independent System 1 and System 2 methods, we validate the necessity of using Dual Process Theory (DPT) in real-time tasks. We propose DPT-Agent, a novel language agent framework that integrates System 1 and System 2 for efficient real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration. DPT-Agent's System 1 uses a Finite-state Machine (FSM) and code-as-policy for fast, intuitive, and controllable decision-making. DPT-Agent's System 2 integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) and asynchronous reflection to infer human intentions and perform reasoning-based autonomous decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPT-Agent through further experiments with rule-based agents and human collaborators, showing significant improvements over mainstream LLM-based frameworks. DPT-Agent can effectively help LLMs convert correct slow thinking and reasoning into executable actions, thereby improving performance. To the best of our knowledge, DPT-Agent is the first language agent framework that achieves successful real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration autonomously. Code of DPT-Agent can be found in https://github.com/sjtu-marl/DPT-Agent.</description>

      <title>TAG: A Decentralized Framework for Multi-Agent Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hierarchical organization is fundamental to biological systems and human societies, yet artificial intelligence systems often rely on monolithic architectures that limit adaptability and scalability. Current hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) approaches typically restrict hierarchies to two levels or require centralized training, which limits their practical applicability. We introduce TAME Agent Framework (TAG), a framework for constructing fully decentralized hierarchical multi-agent systems.TAG enables hierarchies of arbitrary depth through a novel LevelEnv concept, which abstracts each hierarchy level as the environment for the agents above it. This approach standardizes information flow between levels while preserving loose coupling, allowing for seamless integration of diverse agent types. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TAG by implementing hierarchical architectures that combine different RL agents across multiple levels, achieving improved performance over classical multi-agent RL baselines on standard benchmarks. Our results show that decentralized hierarchical organization enhances both learning speed and final performance, positioning TAG as a promising direction for scalable multi-agent systems.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Devin has made a significant buzz in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community as the world's first fully autonomous AI software engineer, capable of independently developing software code. Devin uses the concept of agentic workflow in Generative AI (GenAI), which empowers AI agents to engage in a more dynamic, iterative, and self-reflective process. In this paper, we present a similar fully autonomous AI formal verification engineer, Saarthi, capable of verifying a given RTL design end-to-end using an agentic workflow. With Saarthi, verification engineers can focus on more complex problems, and verification teams can strive for more ambitious goals. The domain-agnostic implementation of Saarthi makes it scalable for use across various domains such as RTL design, UVM-based verification, and others.</description>

      <title>User Intent to Use DeepSeek for Healthcare Purposes and their Trust in the Large Language Model: Multinational Survey Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as interactive healthcare resources, yet user acceptance remains underexplored. This study examines how ease of use, perceived usefulness, trust, and risk perception interact to shape intentions to adopt DeepSeek, an emerging LLM-based platform, for healthcare purposes. A cross-sectional survey of 556 participants from India, the United Kingdom, and the United States was conducted to measure perceptions and usage patterns. Structural equation modeling assessed both direct and indirect effects, including potential quadratic relationships. Results revealed that trust plays a pivotal mediating role: ease of use exerts a significant indirect effect on usage intentions through trust, while perceived usefulness contributes to both trust development and direct adoption. By contrast, risk perception negatively affects usage intent, emphasizing the importance of robust data governance and transparency. Notably, significant non-linear paths were observed for ease of use and risk, indicating threshold or plateau effects. The measurement model demonstrated strong reliability and validity, supported by high composite reliabilities, average variance extracted, and discriminant validity measures. These findings extend technology acceptance and health informatics research by illuminating the multifaceted nature of user adoption in sensitive domains. Stakeholders should invest in trust-building strategies, user-centric design, and risk mitigation measures to encourage sustained and safe uptake of LLMs in healthcare. Future work can employ longitudinal designs or examine culture-specific variables to further clarify how user perceptions evolve over time and across different regulatory environments. Such insights are critical for harnessing AI to enhance outcomes.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Intelligence via Trial and Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligence is a crucial trait for species to find solutions within a limited number of trial-and-error attempts. Building on this idea, we introduce Survival Game as a framework to evaluate intelligence based on the number of failed attempts in a trial-and-error process. Fewer failures indicate higher intelligence. When the expectation and variance of failure counts are both finite, it signals the ability to consistently find solutions to new challenges, which we define as the Autonomous Level of intelligence. Using Survival Game, we comprehensively evaluate existing AI systems. Our results show that while AI systems achieve the Autonomous Level in simple tasks, they are still far from it in more complex tasks, such as vision, search, recommendation, and language. While scaling current AI technologies might help, this would come at an astronomical cost. Projections suggest that achieving the Autonomous Level for general tasks would require $10^{26}$ parameters. To put this into perspective, loading such a massive model requires so many H100 GPUs that their total value is $10^{7}$ times that of Apple Inc.'s market value. Even with Moore's Law, supporting such a parameter scale would take $70$ years. This staggering cost highlights the complexity of human tasks and the inadequacies of current AI technologies. To further investigate this phenomenon, we conduct a theoretical analysis of Survival Game and its experimental results. Our findings suggest that human tasks possess a criticality property. As a result, Autonomous Level requires a deep understanding of the task's underlying mechanisms. Current AI systems, however, do not fully grasp these mechanisms and instead rely on superficial mimicry, making it difficult for them to reach an autonomous level. We believe Survival Game can not only guide the future development of AI but also offer profound insights into human intelligence.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Speculative Decoding for a Tunable Accuracy-Runtime Tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) enforces strict distributional equivalence to the target model, limiting potential speed ups as distributions of near-equivalence achieve comparable outcomes in many cases. Furthermore, enforcing distributional equivalence means that users are unable to trade deviations from the target model distribution for further inference speed gains. To address these limitations, we introduce Fuzzy Speculative Decoding (FSD) - a decoding algorithm that generalizes SD by accepting candidate tokens purely based on the divergences between the target and draft model distributions. By allowing for controlled divergence from the target model, FSD enables users to flexibly trade generation quality for inference speed. Across several benchmarks, our method is able to achieve significant runtime improvements of over 5 tokens per second faster than SD at only an approximate 2% absolute reduction in benchmark accuracy. In many cases, FSD is even able to match SD benchmark accuracy at over 2 tokens per second faster, demonstrating that distributional equivalence is not necessary to maintain target model performance.</description>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promising capabilities in mathematical reasoning within visual contexts across various datasets. However, most existing multimodal math benchmarks are limited to single-visual contexts, which diverges from the multi-visual scenarios commonly encountered in real-world mathematical applications. To address this gap, we introduce MV-MATH: a meticulously curated dataset of 2,009 high-quality mathematical problems. Each problem integrates multiple images interleaved with text, derived from authentic K-12 scenarios, and enriched with detailed annotations. MV-MATH includes multiple-choice, free-form, and multi-step questions, covering 11 subject areas across 3 difficulty levels, and serves as a comprehensive and rigorous benchmark for assessing MLLMs' mathematical reasoning in multi-visual contexts. Through extensive experimentation, we observe that MLLMs encounter substantial challenges in multi-visual math tasks, with a considerable performance gap relative to human capabilities on MV-MATH. Furthermore, we analyze the performance and error patterns of various models, providing insights into MLLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities within multi-visual settings.</description>

Abstract: The integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework has attracted significant interest, with early studies showing promise in mitigating hallucinations and improving model accuracy. However, a systematic understanding and comparative analysis of the rapidly emerging KG-RAG methods are still lacking. This paper seeks to lay the foundation for systematically answering the question of when and how to use KG-RAG by analyzing their performance in various application scenarios associated with different technical configurations. After outlining the mind map using KG-RAG framework and summarizing its popular pipeline, we conduct a pilot empirical study of KG-RAG works to reimplement and evaluate 6 KG-RAG methods across 7 datasets in diverse scenarios, analyzing the impact of 9 KG-RAG configurations in combination with 17 LLMs. Our results underscore the critical role of appropriate application conditions and optimal configurations of KG-RAG components.</description>

      <title>Max-Affine Spline Insights Into Deep Network Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.02338v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the importance of pruning in Deep Networks (DNs) and the yin &amp; yang relationship between (1) pruning highly overparametrized DNs that have been trained from random initialization and (2) training small DNs that have been "cleverly" initialized. As in most cases practitioners can only resort to random initialization, there is a strong need to develop a grounded understanding of DN pruning. Current literature remains largely empirical, lacking a theoretical understanding of how pruning affects DNs' decision boundary, how to interpret pruning, and how to design corresponding principled pruning techniques. To tackle those questions, we propose to employ recent advances in the theoretical analysis of Continuous Piecewise Affine (CPA) DNs. From this perspective, we will be able to detect the early-bird (EB) ticket phenomenon, provide interpretability into current pruning techniques, and develop a principled pruning strategy. In each step of our study, we conduct extensive experiments supporting our claims and results; while our main goal is to enhance the current understanding towards DN pruning instead of developing a new pruning method, our spline pruning criteria in terms of layerwise and global pruning is on par with or even outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods.</description>

      <title>ShiftAddNAS: Hardware-Inspired Search for More Accurate and Efficient Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.08119v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) with intensive multiplications (e.g., convolutions and transformers) are capable yet power hungry, impeding their more extensive deployment into resource-constrained devices. As such, multiplication-free networks, which follow a common practice in energy-efficient hardware implementation to parameterize NNs with more efficient operators (e.g., bitwise shifts and additions), have gained growing attention. However, multiplication-free networks usually under-perform their vanilla counterparts in terms of the achieved accuracy. To this end, this work advocates hybrid NNs that consist of both powerful yet costly multiplications and efficient yet less powerful operators for marrying the best of both worlds, and proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs. Our ShiftAddNAS highlights two enablers. Specifically, it integrates (1) the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs; and (2) a novel weight sharing strategy that enables effective weight sharing among different operators that follow heterogeneous distributions (e.g., Gaussian for convolutions vs. Laplacian for add operators) and simultaneously leads to a largely reduced supernet size and much better searched networks. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on various models, datasets, and tasks consistently validate the efficacy of ShiftAddNAS, e.g., achieving up to a +7.7% higher accuracy or a +4.9 better BLEU score compared to state-of-the-art NN, while leading to up to 93% or 69% energy and latency savings, respectively. Codes and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/RICE-EIC/ShiftAddNAS.</description>

Abstract: Information-seeking AI assistant systems aim to answer users' queries about knowledge in a timely manner. However, both the human-perceived helpfulness of information-seeking assistant systems and its fairness implication are under-explored. In this paper, we study computational measurements of helpfulness. We collect human annotations on the helpfulness of dialogue responses, develop models for automatic helpfulness evaluation, and then propose to use the helpfulness level of a dialogue system towards different user queries to gauge the fairness of a dialogue system. Experiments with state-of-the-art dialogue systems, including ChatGPT, under three information-seeking scenarios reveal that existing systems tend to be more helpful for questions regarding concepts from highly-developed countries than less-developed countries, uncovering potential fairness concerns underlying the current information-seeking assistant systems.</description>

      <title>MOVE: Effective and Harmless Ownership Verification via Embedded External Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Currently, deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely adopted in different applications. Despite its commercial values, training a well-performing DNN is resource-consuming. Accordingly, the well-trained model is valuable intellectual property for its owner. However, recent studies revealed the threats of model stealing, where the adversaries can obtain a function-similar copy of the victim model, even when they can only query the model. In this paper, we propose an effective and harmless model ownership verification (MOVE) to defend against different types of model stealing simultaneously, without introducing new security risks. In general, we conduct the ownership verification by verifying whether a suspicious model contains the knowledge of defender-specified external features. Specifically, we embed the external features by modifying a few training samples with style transfer. We then train a meta-classifier to determine whether a model is stolen from the victim. This approach is inspired by the understanding that the stolen models should contain the knowledge of features learned by the victim model. In particular, \revision{we develop our MOVE method under both white-box and black-box settings and analyze its theoretical foundation to provide comprehensive model protection.} Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our method and its resistance to potential adaptive attacks. The codes for reproducing the main experiments of our method are available at https://github.com/THUYimingLi/MOVE.</description>

      <title>Online Reinforcement Learning in Non-Stationary Context-Driven Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study online reinforcement learning (RL) in non-stationary environments, where a time-varying exogenous context process affects the environment dynamics. Online RL is challenging in such environments due to "catastrophic forgetting" (CF). The agent tends to forget prior knowledge as it trains on new experiences. Prior approaches to mitigate this issue assume task labels (which are often not available in practice), employ brittle regularization heuristics or use off-policy methods that suffer from instability and poor performance.
  We present Locally Constrained Policy Optimization (LCPO), an online RL approach that combats CF by anchoring policy outputs on old experiences while optimizing the return on current experiences. To perform this anchoring, LCPO locally constrains policy optimization using samples from experiences that lie outside of the current context distribution. We evaluate LCPO in Mujoco, classic control and computer systems environments with a variety of synthetic and real context traces, and find that it outperforms a variety of baselines in the non-stationary setting, while achieving results on-par with a "prescient" agent trained offline across all context traces.
  LCPO's source code is available at https://github.com/pouyahmdn/LCPO.</description>

      <title>Full Scaling Automation for Sustainable Development of Green Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid rise in cloud computing has resulted in an alarming increase in data centers' carbon emissions, which now accounts for &gt;3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, necessitating immediate steps to combat their mounting strain on the global climate. An important focus of this effort is to improve resource utilization in order to save electricity usage. Our proposed Full Scaling Automation (FSA) mechanism is an effective method of dynamically adapting resources to accommodate changing workloads in large-scale cloud computing clusters, enabling the clusters in data centers to maintain their desired CPU utilization target and thus improve energy efficiency. FSA harnesses the power of deep representation learning to accurately predict the future workload of each service and automatically stabilize the corresponding target CPU usage level, unlike the previous autoscaling methods, such as Autopilot or FIRM, that need to adjust computing resources with statistical models and expert knowledge. Our approach achieves significant performance improvement compared to the existing work in real-world datasets. We also deployed FSA on large-scale cloud computing clusters in industrial data centers, and according to the certification of the China Environmental United Certification Center (CEC), a reduction of 947 tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to a saving of 1538,000 kWh of electricity, was achieved during the Double 11 shopping festival of 2022, marking a critical step for our company's strategic goal towards carbon neutrality by 2030.</description>

      <title>SecureFalcon: Are We There Yet in Automated Software Vulnerability Detection with LLMs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Software vulnerabilities can cause numerous problems, including crashes, data loss, and security breaches. These issues greatly compromise quality and can negatively impact the market adoption of software applications and systems. Traditional bug-fixing methods, such as static analysis, often produce false positives. While bounded model checking, a form of Formal Verification (FV), can provide more accurate outcomes compared to static analyzers, it demands substantial resources and significantly hinders developer productivity. Can Machine Learning (ML) achieve accuracy comparable to FV methods and be used in popular instant code completion frameworks in near real-time? In this paper, we introduce SecureFalcon, an innovative model architecture with only 121 million parameters derived from the Falcon-40B model and explicitly tailored for classifying software vulnerabilities. To achieve the best performance, we trained our model using two datasets, namely the FormAI dataset and the FalconVulnDB. The FalconVulnDB is a combination of recent public datasets, namely the SySeVR framework, Draper VDISC, Bigvul, Diversevul, SARD Juliet, and ReVeal datasets. These datasets contain the top 25 most dangerous software weaknesses, such as CWE-119, CWE-120, CWE-476, CWE-122, CWE-190, CWE-121, CWE-78, CWE-787, CWE-20, and CWE-762. SecureFalcon achieves 94% accuracy in binary classification and up to 92% in multiclassification, with instant CPU inference times. It outperforms existing models such as BERT, RoBERTa, CodeBERT, and traditional ML algorithms, promising to push the boundaries of software vulnerability detection and instant code completion frameworks.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing Physically Plausible Human Motions in 3D Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a physics-based character control framework for synthesizing human-scene interactions. Recent advances adopt physics simulation to mitigate artifacts produced by data-driven kinematic approaches. However, existing physics-based methods mainly focus on single-object environments, resulting in limited applicability in realistic 3D scenes with multi-objects. To address such challenges, we propose a framework that enables physically simulated characters to perform long-term interaction tasks in diverse, cluttered, and unseen 3D scenes. The key idea is to decouple human-scene interactions into two fundamental processes, Interacting and Navigating, which motivates us to construct two reusable Controllers, namely InterCon and NavCon. Specifically, InterCon uses two complementary policies to enable characters to enter or leave the interacting state with a particular object (e.g., sitting on a chair or getting up). To realize navigation in cluttered environments, we introduce NavCon, where a trajectory following policy enables characters to track pre-planned collision-free paths. Benefiting from the divide and conquer strategy, we can train all policies in simple environments and directly apply them in complex multi-object scenes through coordination from a rule-based scheduler. Video and code are available at https://github.com/liangpan99/InterScene.</description>

      <title>Representation Engineering: A Top-Down Approach to AI Transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01405v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we identify and characterize the emerging area of representation engineering (RepE), an approach to enhancing the transparency of AI systems that draws on insights from cognitive neuroscience. RepE places population-level representations, rather than neurons or circuits, at the center of analysis, equipping us with novel methods for monitoring and manipulating high-level cognitive phenomena in deep neural networks (DNNs). We provide baselines and an initial analysis of RepE techniques, showing that they offer simple yet effective solutions for improving our understanding and control of large language models. We showcase how these methods can provide traction on a wide range of safety-relevant problems, including honesty, harmlessness, power-seeking, and more, demonstrating the promise of top-down transparency research. We hope that this work catalyzes further exploration of RepE and fosters advancements in the transparency and safety of AI systems.</description>

      <title>Assessing Robustness via Score-Based Adversarial Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most adversarial attacks and defenses focus on perturbations within small $\ell_p$-norm constraints. However, $\ell_p$ threat models cannot capture all relevant semantics-preserving perturbations, and hence, the scope of robustness evaluations is limited. In this work, we introduce Score-Based Adversarial Generation (ScoreAG), a novel framework that leverages the advancements in score-based generative models to generate unrestricted adversarial examples that overcome the limitations of $\ell_p$-norm constraints. Unlike traditional methods, ScoreAG maintains the core semantics of images while generating adversarial examples, either by transforming existing images or synthesizing new ones entirely from scratch. We further exploit the generative capability of ScoreAG to purify images, empirically enhancing the robustness of classifiers. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that ScoreAG improves upon the majority of state-of-the-art attacks and defenses across multiple benchmarks. This work highlights the importance of investigating adversarial examples bounded by semantics rather than $\ell_p$-norm constraints. ScoreAG represents an important step towards more encompassing robustness assessments.</description>

      <title>JudgeLM: Fine-tuned Large Language Models are Scalable Judges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in open-ended scenarios is challenging because existing benchmarks and metrics can not measure them comprehensively. To address this problem, we propose to fine-tune LLMs as scalable judges (JudgeLM) to evaluate LLMs efficiently and effectively in open-ended benchmarks. We first propose a comprehensive, large-scale, high-quality dataset containing task seeds, LLMs-generated answers, and GPT-4-generated judgments for fine-tuning high-performance judges, as well as a new benchmark for evaluating the judges. We train JudgeLM at different scales from 7B, 13B, to 33B parameters, and conduct a systematic analysis of its capabilities and behaviors. We then analyze the key biases in fine-tuning LLM as a judge and consider them as position bias, knowledge bias, and format bias. To address these issues, JudgeLM introduces a bag of techniques including swap augmentation, reference support, and reference drop, which clearly enhance the judge's performance. JudgeLM obtains the state-of-the-art judge performance on both the existing PandaLM benchmark and our proposed new benchmark. Our JudgeLM is efficient and the JudgeLM-7B only needs 3 minutes to judge 5K samples with 8 A100 GPUs. JudgeLM obtains high agreement with the teacher judge, achieving an agreement exceeding 90% that even surpasses human-to-human agreement. JudgeLM also demonstrates extended capabilities in being judges of the single answer, multimodal models, multiple answers, multi-turn chat, etc. Code is available at https://github.com/baaivision/JudgeLM.</description>

      <title>Bridging Classical and Quantum Machine Learning: Knowledge Transfer From Classical to Quantum Neural Networks Using Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs), harnessing superposition and entanglement, have shown potential to surpass classical methods in complex learning tasks but remain limited by hardware constraints and noisy conditions. In this work, we present a novel framework for transferring knowledge from classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to QNNs via knowledge distillation, thereby reducing the need for resource intensive quantum training and error mitigation. We conduct extensive experiments using two parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) with 4 and 8 qubits on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets. The approach demonstrates consistent accuracy improvements attributed to distilled knowledge from larger classical networks. Through ablation studies, we systematically compare the effect of state of the art dimensionality reduction techniques fully connected layers, center cropping, principal component analysis, and pooling to compress high-dimensional image data prior to quantum encoding. Our findings reveal that fully connected layers retain the most salient features for QNN inference, thereby surpassing other down sampling approaches. Additionally, we examine state of the art data encoding methods (amplitude, angle, and qubit encoding) and identify amplitude encoding as the optimal strategy, yielding superior accuracy across all tested datasets and qubit configurations. Through computational analyses, we show that our distilled 4-qubit and 8-qubit QNNs achieve competitive performance while utilizing significantly fewer parameters than their classical counterparts. Our results establish a promising paradigm for bridging classical deep learning and emerging quantum computing, paving the way for more powerful, resource conscious models in quantum machine intelligence.</description>

      <title>Global $\mathcal{L}^2$ minimization at uniform exponential rate via geometrically adapted gradient descent in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15487v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the scenario of supervised learning in Deep Learning (DL) networks, and exploit the arbitrariness of choice in the Riemannian metric relative to which the gradient descent flow can be defined (a general fact of differential geometry). In the standard approach to DL, the gradient flow on the space of parameters (weights and biases) is defined with respect to the Euclidean metric. Here instead, we choose the gradient flow with respect to the Euclidean metric in the output layer of the DL network. This naturally induces two modified versions of the gradient descent flow in the parameter space, one adapted for the overparametrized setting, and the other for the underparametrized setting. In the overparametrized case, we prove that, provided that a rank condition holds, all orbits of the modified gradient descent drive the ${\mathcal L}^2$ cost to its global minimum at a uniform exponential convergence rate; one thereby obtains an a priori stopping time for any prescribed proximity to the global minimum. We point out relations of the latter to sub-Riemannian geometry. Moreover, we generalize the above framework to the situation in which the rank condition does not hold; in particular, we show that local equilibria can only exist if a rank loss occurs, and that generically, they are not isolated points, but elements of a critical submanifold of parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have paved the way for being a cornerstone in graph-related learning tasks. Yet, the ability of GNNs to capture structural interactions within graphs remains under-explored. In this work, we address this gap by drawing on the insight that permutation invariant graph partitioning enables a powerful way of exploring structural interactions. We establish theoretical connections between permutation invariant graph partitioning and graph isomorphism, and then propose Graph Partitioning Neural Networks (GPNNs), a novel architecture that efficiently enhances the expressive power of GNNs in learning structural interactions. We analyze how partitioning schemes and structural interactions contribute to GNN expressivity and their trade-offs with complexity. Empirically, we demonstrate that GPNNs outperform existing GNN models in capturing structural interactions across diverse graph benchmark tasks.</description>

      <title>Through the Looking-Glass: Transparency Implications and Challenges in Enterprise AI Knowledge Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09410v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge can't be disentangled from people. As AI knowledge systems mine vast volumes of work-related data, the knowledge that's being extracted and surfaced is intrinsically linked to the people who create and use it. When predictive algorithms that learn from data are used to link knowledge and people, inaccuracies in knowledge extraction and surfacing can lead to disproportionate harms, influencing how individuals see each other and how they see themselves at work. In this paper, we present a reflective analysis of transparency requirements and impacts in this type of systems. We conduct a multidisciplinary literature review to understand the impacts of transparency in workplace settings, introducing the looking-glass metaphor to conceptualize AI knowledge systems as systems that reflect and distort, expanding our view on transparency requirements, implications and challenges. We formulate transparency as a key mediator in shaping different ways of seeing, including seeing into the system, which unveils its capabilities, limitations and behavior, and seeing through the system, which shapes workers' perceptions of their own contributions and others within the organization. Recognizing the sociotechnical nature of these systems, we identify three transparency dimensions necessary to realize the value of AI knowledge systems, namely system transparency, procedural transparency and transparency of outcomes. We discuss key challenges hindering the implementation of these forms of transparency, bringing to light the wider sociotechnical gap and highlighting directions for future Computer-supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) research.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Message Passing for Learning on Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05569v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are crucial for modelling higher-order interactions in real-world data. Hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) effectively utilise these structures by message passing to generate informative node features for various downstream tasks like node classification. However, the message passing module in existing HNNs typically requires a computationally intensive training process, which limits their practical use. To tackle this challenge, we propose an alternative approach by decoupling the usage of hypergraph structural information from the model learning stage. This leads to a novel training-free message passing module, named TF-MP-Module, which can be precomputed in the data preprocessing stage, thereby reducing the computational burden. We refer to the hypergraph neural network equipped with our TF-MP-Module as TF-HNN. We theoretically support the efficiency and effectiveness of TF-HNN by showing that: 1) It is more training-efficient compared to existing HNNs; 2) It utilises as much information as existing HNNs for node feature generation; and 3) It is robust against the oversmoothing issue while using long-range interactions. Experiments based on seven real-world hypergraph benchmarks in node classification and hyperlink prediction show that, compared to state-of-the-art HNNs, TF-HNN exhibits both competitive performance and superior training efficiency. Specifically, on the large-scale benchmark, Trivago, TF-HNN outperforms the node classification accuracy of the best baseline by 10% with just 1% of the training time of that baseline.</description>

      <title>AI, Meet Human: Learning Paradigms for Hybrid Decision Making Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Everyday we increasingly rely on machine learning models to automate and support high-stake tasks and decisions. This growing presence means that humans are now constantly interacting with machine learning-based systems, training and using models everyday. Several different techniques in computer science literature account for the human interaction with machine learning systems, but their classification is sparse and the goals varied. This survey proposes a taxonomy of Hybrid Decision Making Systems, providing both a conceptual and technical framework for understanding how current computer science literature models interaction between humans and machines.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Distributed Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08156v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can agents exchange information to learn while protecting privacy? Healthcare centers collaborating on clinical trials must balance knowledge sharing with safeguarding sensitive patient data. We address this challenge by using differential privacy (DP) to control information leakage. Agents update belief statistics via log-linear rules, and DP noise provides plausible deniability and rigorous performance guarantees. We study two settings: distributed maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with a finite set of private signals and online learning from an intermittent signal stream. Noisy aggregation introduces trade-offs between rejecting low-quality states and accepting high-quality ones. The MLE setting naturally applies to binary hypothesis testing with formal statistical guarantees. Through simulations, we demonstrate differentially private, distributed survival analysis on real-world clinical trial data, evaluating treatment efficacy and the impact of biomedical indices on patient survival. Our methods enable privacy-preserving inference with greater efficiency and lower error rates than homomorphic encryption and first-order DP optimization approaches.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Controlled Traversing of the Attractor Landscape of Boolean Models in the Context of Cellular Reprogramming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08491v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cellular reprogramming can be used for both the prevention and cure of different diseases. However, the efficiency of discovering reprogramming strategies with classical wet-lab experiments is hindered by lengthy time commitments and high costs. In this study, we develop a novel computational framework based on deep reinforcement learning that facilitates the identification of reprogramming strategies. For this aim, we formulate a control problem in the context of cellular reprogramming for the frameworks of BNs and PBNs under the asynchronous update mode. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of a pseudo-attractor and a procedure for identification of pseudo-attractor state during training. Finally, we devise a computational framework for solving the control problem, which we test on a number of different models.</description>

      <title>Generative Representational Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: All text-based language problems can be reduced to either generation or embedding. Current models only perform well at one or the other. We introduce generative representational instruction tuning (GRIT) whereby a large language model is trained to handle both generative and embedding tasks by distinguishing between them through instructions. Compared to other open models, our resulting GritLM 7B sets a new state of the art on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and outperforms all models up to its size on a range of generative tasks. By scaling up further, GritLM 8x7B outperforms all open generative language models that we tried while still being among the best embedding models. Notably, we find that GRIT matches training on only generative or embedding data, thus we can unify both at no performance loss. Among other benefits, the unification via GRIT speeds up Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by &gt; 60% for long documents, by no longer requiring separate retrieval and generation models. Models, code, etc. are freely available at https://github.com/ContextualAI/gritlm.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Large Language Models with Pseudo- and Multisource- Knowledge Graphs for Open-ended Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mitigating the hallucinations of Large Language Models is a crucial task. Although some existing methods employ self-enhancement techniques, they fall short of effectively addressing unknown factual hallucinations. Meanwhile, Knowledge Graph (KG) enhancement approaches fail to address the generalization across different KG sources and the enhancement of open-ended answer questions simultaneously. To tackle these limitations, we propose a framework that combines Pseudo-Graph Generation and Atomic Knowledge Verification (PG\&amp;AKV). Enhancement of open-ended question-answering begins with leveraging the Pseudo-Graph Generation to provide the related knowledge framework. Subsequently, Atomic Knowledge Verification utilizes atomic-level knowledge querying and verification to achieve generalizability under different KG sources. Compared to the baseline, this approach yields a minimum improvement of 11.5 in the ROUGE-L score for open-ended questions. For precise-answered questions, we observe a minimum accuracy improvement of 7.5%. Moreover, PG\&amp;AKV also exhibits generalizability across different KG sources. Utilizing KG different from the question sources, PG\&amp;AKV can even achieve at least a 3.5 % performance improvement. In summary, our results pave the way for enhancing LLMs by incorporating Pseudo- and Multisource-KGs, particularly in the filed of open-ended questions.</description>

      <title>Inference to the Best Explanation in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have found success in real-world applications, their underlying explanatory process is still poorly understood. This paper proposes IBE-Eval, a framework inspired by philosophical accounts on Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE) to advance the interpretation and evaluation of LLMs' explanations. IBE-Eval estimates the plausibility of natural language explanations through a combination of explicit logical and linguistic features including: consistency, parsimony, coherence, and uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on Causal Question Answering (CQA), where \textit{IBE-Eval} is tasked to select the most plausible causal explanation amongst competing ones generated by LLMs (i.e., GPT 3.5 and Llama 2). The experiments reveal that IBE-Eval can successfully identify the best explanation with up to 77\% accuracy ($\approx 27\%$ above random), improving upon a GPT 3.5-as-a-Judge baseline ($\approx+17\%$) while being intrinsically more efficient and interpretable. Additional analyses suggest that, despite model-specific variances, LLM-generated explanations tend to conform to IBE criteria and that IBE-Eval is significantly correlated with human judgment, opening up opportunities for future development of automated explanation verification tools.</description>

      <title>Signature Kernel Conditional Independence Tests in Causal Discovery for Stochastic Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18477v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring the causal structure underlying stochastic dynamical systems from observational data holds great promise in domains ranging from science and health to finance. Such processes can often be accurately modeled via stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which naturally imply causal relationships via "which variables enter the differential of which other variables". In this paper, we develop conditional independence (CI) constraints on coordinate processes over selected intervals that are Markov with respect to the acyclic dependence graph (allowing self-loops) induced by a general SDE model. We then provide a sound and complete causal discovery algorithm, capable of handling both fully and partially observed data, and uniquely recovering the underlying or induced ancestral graph by exploiting time directionality assuming a CI oracle. Finally, to make our algorithm practically usable, we also propose a flexible, consistent signature kernel-based CI test to infer these constraints from data. We extensively benchmark the CI test in isolation and as part of our causal discovery algorithms, outperforming existing approaches in SDE models and beyond.</description>

      <title>SynGhost: Invisible and Universal Task-agnostic Backdoor Attack via Syntactic Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18945v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although pre-training achieves remarkable performance, it suffers from task-agnostic backdoor attacks due to vulnerabilities in data and training mechanisms. These attacks can transfer backdoors to various downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce $\mathtt{maxEntropy}$, an entropy-based poisoning filter that mitigates such risks. To overcome the limitations of manual target setting and explicit triggers, we propose $\mathtt{SynGhost}$, an invisible and universal task-agnostic backdoor attack via syntactic transfer, further exposing vulnerabilities in pre-trained language models (PLMs). Specifically, $\mathtt{SynGhost}$ injects multiple syntactic backdoors into the pre-training space through corpus poisoning, while preserving the PLM's pre-training capabilities. Second, $\mathtt{SynGhost}$ adaptively selects optimal targets based on contrastive learning, creating a uniform distribution in the pre-training space. To identify syntactic differences, we also introduce an awareness module to minimize interference between backdoors. Experiments show that $\mathtt{SynGhost}$ poses significant threats and can transfer to various downstream tasks. Furthermore, $\mathtt{SynGhost}$ resists defenses based on perplexity, fine-pruning, and $\mathtt{maxEntropy}$. The code is available at https://github.com/Zhou-CyberSecurity-AI/SynGhost.</description>

      <title>Iterated $Q$-Network: Beyond One-Step Bellman Updates in Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02107v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vast majority of Reinforcement Learning methods is largely impacted by the computation effort and data requirements needed to obtain effective estimates of action-value functions, which in turn determine the quality of the overall performance and the sample-efficiency of the learning procedure. Typically, action-value functions are estimated through an iterative scheme that alternates the application of an empirical approximation of the Bellman operator and a subsequent projection step onto a considered function space. It has been observed that this scheme can be potentially generalized to carry out multiple iterations of the Bellman operator at once, benefiting the underlying learning algorithm. However, till now, it has been challenging to effectively implement this idea, especially in high-dimensional problems. In this paper, we introduce iterated $Q$-Network (i-QN), a novel principled approach that enables multiple consecutive Bellman updates by learning a tailored sequence of action-value functions where each serves as the target for the next. We show that i-QN is theoretically grounded and that it can be seamlessly used in value-based and actor-critic methods. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of i-QN in Atari $2600$ games and MuJoCo continuous control problems.</description>

      <title>Prompting Fairness: Integrating Causality to Debias Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities, are susceptible to generating biased and discriminatory responses. As LLMs increasingly influence high-stakes decision-making (e.g., hiring and healthcare), mitigating these biases becomes critical. In this work, we propose a causality-guided debiasing framework to tackle social biases, aiming to reduce the objectionable dependence between LLMs' decisions and the social information in the input. Our framework introduces a novel perspective to identify how social information can affect an LLM's decision through different causal pathways. Leveraging these causal insights, we outline principled prompting strategies that regulate these pathways through selection mechanisms. This framework not only unifies existing prompting-based debiasing techniques, but also opens up new directions for reducing bias by encouraging the model to prioritize fact-based reasoning over reliance on biased social cues. We validate our framework through extensive experiments on real-world datasets across multiple domains, demonstrating its effectiveness in debiasing LLM decisions, even with only black-box access to the model.</description>

      <title>Explainable Machine Learning-Based Security and Privacy Protection Framework for Internet of Medical Things Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) transcends traditional medical boundaries, enabling a transition from reactive treatment to proactive prevention. This innovative method revolutionizes healthcare by facilitating early disease detection and tailored care, particularly in chronic disease management, where IoMT automates treatments based on real-time health data collection. Nonetheless, its benefits are countered by significant security challenges that endanger the lives of its users due to the sensitivity and value of the processed data, thereby attracting malicious interests. Moreover, the utilization of wireless communication for data transmission exposes medical data to interception and tampering by cybercriminals. Additionally, anomalies may arise due to human error, network interference, or hardware malfunctions. In this context, anomaly detection based on Machine Learning (ML) is an interesting solution, but it comes up against obstacles in terms of explicability and privacy protection. To address these challenges, a new framework for Intrusion Detection Systems is introduced, leveraging Artificial Neural Networks for intrusion detection while utilizing Federated Learning (FL) for privacy preservation. Additionally, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence methods are incorporated to enhance model explanation and interpretation. The efficacy of the proposed framework is evaluated and compared with centralized approaches using multiple datasets containing network and medical data, simulating various attack types impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of medical and physiological data. The results obtained offer compelling evidence that the FL method performs comparably to the centralized method, demonstrating high performance. Additionally, it affords the dual advantage of safeguarding privacy and providing model explanation while adhering to ethical principles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a dataset of expert demonstrations, inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to recover a reward for which the expert is optimal. This work proposes a model-free algorithm to solve entropy-regularized IRL problem. In particular, we employ a stochastic gradient descent update for the reward and a stochastic soft policy iteration update for the policy. Assuming access to a generative model, we prove that our algorithm is guaranteed to recover a reward for which the expert is $\varepsilon$-optimal using $\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon^{2})$ samples of the Markov decision process (MDP). Furthermore, with $\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon^{4})$ samples we prove that the optimal policy corresponding to the recovered reward is $\varepsilon$-close to the expert policy in total variation distance.</description>

      <title>Optimization-based Prompt Injection Attack to LLM-as-a-Judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17710v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge uses a large language model (LLM) to select the best response from a set of candidates for a given question. LLM-as-a-Judge has many applications such as LLM-powered search, reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF), and tool selection. In this work, we propose JudgeDeceiver, an optimization-based prompt injection attack to LLM-as-a-Judge. JudgeDeceiver injects a carefully crafted sequence into an attacker-controlled candidate response such that LLM-as-a-Judge selects the candidate response for an attacker-chosen question no matter what other candidate responses are. Specifically, we formulate finding such sequence as an optimization problem and propose a gradient based method to approximately solve it. Our extensive evaluation shows that JudgeDeceive is highly effective, and is much more effective than existing prompt injection attacks that manually craft the injected sequences and jailbreak attacks when extended to our problem. We also show the effectiveness of JudgeDeceiver in three case studies, i.e., LLM-powered search, RLAIF, and tool selection. Moreover, we consider defenses including known-answer detection, perplexity detection, and perplexity windowed detection. Our results show these defenses are insufficient, highlighting the urgent need for developing new defense strategies. Our implementation is available at this repository: https://github.com/ShiJiawenwen/JudgeDeceiver.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Decentraland Economy: Multifaceted Parcel Attributes, Key Insights, and Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive Decentraland parcels dataset, called IITP-VDLand, sourced from diverse platforms such as Decentraland, OpenSea, Etherscan, Google BigQuery, and various Social Media Platforms. Unlike existing datasets which have limited attributes and records, IITP-VDLand offers a rich array of attributes, encompassing parcel characteristics, trading history, past activities, transactions, and social media interactions. Alongside, we introduce a key attribute in the dataset, namely Rarity score, which measures the uniqueness of each parcel within the virtual world. Addressing the significant challenge posed by the dispersed nature of this data across various sources, we employ a systematic approach, utilizing both available APIs and custom scripts, to gather it. Subsequently, we meticulously curate and organize the information into four distinct fragments: (1) Characteristics, (2) OpenSea Trading History, (3) Ethereum Activity Transactions, and (4) Social Media. We envisage that this dataset would serve as a robust resource for training machine- and deep-learning models specifically designed to address real-world challenges within the domain of Decentraland parcels. The performance benchmarking of more than 20 state-of-the-art price prediction models on our dataset yields promising results, achieving a maximum R2 score of 0.8251 and an accuracy of 74.23% in case of Extra Trees Regressor and Classifier. The key findings reveal that the ensemble models perform better than both deep learning and linear models for our dataset. We observe a significant impact of coordinates, geographical proximity, rarity score, and few other economic indicators on the prediction of parcel prices.</description>

      <title>An Effective Automated Speaking Assessment Approach to Mitigating Data Scarcity and Imbalanced Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07575v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated speaking assessment (ASA) typically involves automatic speech recognition (ASR) and hand-crafted feature extraction from the ASR transcript of a learner's speech. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown stellar performance compared to traditional methods. However, SSL-based ASA systems are faced with at least three data-related challenges: limited annotated data, uneven distribution of learner proficiency levels and non-uniform score intervals between different CEFR proficiency levels. To address these challenges, we explore the use of two novel modeling strategies: metric-based classification and loss reweighting, leveraging distinct SSL-based embedding features. Extensive experimental results on the ICNALE benchmark dataset suggest that our approach can outperform existing strong baselines by a sizable margin, achieving a significant improvement of more than 10% in CEFR prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Atomas: Hierarchical Alignment on Molecule-Text for Unified Molecule Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecule-and-text cross-modal representation learning has emerged as a promising direction for enhancing the quality of molecular representation, thereby improving performance in various scientific fields. However, most approaches employ a global alignment approach to learn the knowledge from different modalities that may fail to capture fine-grained information, such as molecule-and-text fragments and stereoisomeric nuances, which is crucial for downstream tasks. Furthermore, it is incapable of modeling such information using a similar global alignment strategy due to the lack of annotations about the fine-grained fragments in the existing dataset. In this paper, we propose Atomas, a hierarchical molecular representation learning framework that jointly learns representations from SMILES strings and text. We design a Hierarchical Adaptive Alignment model to automatically learn the fine-grained fragment correspondence between two modalities and align these representations at three semantic levels. Atomas's end-to-end training framework supports understanding and generating molecules, enabling a wider range of downstream tasks. Atomas achieves superior performance across 12 tasks on 11 datasets, outperforming 11 baseline models thus highlighting the effectiveness and versatility of our method. Scaling experiments further demonstrate Atomas's robustness and scalability. Moreover, visualization and qualitative analysis, validated by human experts, confirm the chemical relevance of our approach. Codes are released on https://github.com/yikunpku/Atomas.</description>

      <title>A Conditional Independence Test in the Presence of Discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17644v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Testing conditional independence has many applications, such as in Bayesian network learning and causal discovery. Different test methods have been proposed. However, existing methods generally can not work when only discretized observations are available. Specifically, consider $X_1$, $\tilde{X}_2$ and $X_3$ are observed variables, where $\tilde{X}_2$ is a discretization of latent variables $X_2$. Applying existing test methods to the observations of $X_1$, $\tilde{X}_2$ and $X_3$ can lead to a false conclusion about the underlying conditional independence of variables $X_1$, $X_2$ and $X_3$. Motivated by this, we propose a conditional independence test specifically designed to accommodate the presence of such discretization. To achieve this, we design the bridge equations to recover the parameter reflecting the statistical information of the underlying latent continuous variables. An appropriate test statistic and its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis of conditional independence have also been derived. Both theoretical results and empirical validation have been provided, demonstrating the effectiveness of our test methods.</description>

      <title>Boosting Jailbreak Attack with Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, notably the well-known jailbreak attack. In particular, the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack has demonstrated efficacy in exploiting this vulnerability by optimizing adversarial prompts through a combination of gradient heuristics and greedy search. However, the efficiency of this attack has become a bottleneck in the attacking process. To mitigate this limitation, in this paper we rethink the generation of the adversarial prompts through an optimization lens, aiming to stabilize the optimization process and harness more heuristic insights from previous optimization iterations. Specifically, we propose the \textbf{M}omentum \textbf{A}ccelerated G\textbf{C}G (\textbf{MAC}) attack, which integrates a momentum term into the gradient heuristic to boost and stabilize the random search for tokens in adversarial prompts. Experimental results showcase the notable enhancement achieved by MAC over baselines in terms of attack success rate and optimization efficiency. Moreover, we demonstrate that MAC can still exhibit superior performance for transfer attacks and models under defense mechanisms.

      <title>Balance Reward and Safety Optimization for Safe Reinforcement Learning: A Perspective of Gradient Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of Reinforcement Learning (RL) is crucial for its deployment in real-world applications. Nevertheless, managing the trade-off between reward and safety during exploration presents a significant challenge. Improving reward performance through policy adjustments may adversely affect safety performance. In this study, we aim to address this conflicting relation by leveraging the theory of gradient manipulation. Initially, we analyze the conflict between reward and safety gradients. Subsequently, we tackle the balance between reward and safety optimization by proposing a soft switching policy optimization method, for which we provide convergence analysis. Based on our theoretical examination, we provide a safe RL framework to overcome the aforementioned challenge, and we develop a Safety-MuJoCo Benchmark to assess the performance of safe RL algorithms. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method on the Safety-MuJoCo Benchmark and a popular safe RL benchmark, Omnisafe. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms outperform several state-of-the-art baselines in terms of balancing reward and safety optimization.</description>

      <title>NL2FOL: Translating Natural Language to First-Order Logic for Logical Fallacy Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Translating natural language into formal language such as First-Order Logic (FOL) is a foundational challenge in NLP with wide-ranging applications in automated reasoning, misinformation tracking, and knowledge validation. In this paper, we introduce Natural Language to First-Order Logic (NL2FOL), a framework to autoformalize natural language to FOL step by step using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach addresses key challenges in this translation process, including the integration of implicit background knowledge. By leveraging structured representations generated by NL2FOL, we use Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers to reason about the logical validity of natural language statements. We present logical fallacy detection as a case study to evaluate the efficacy of NL2FOL. Being neurosymbolic, our approach also provides interpretable insights into the reasoning process and demonstrates robustness without requiring model fine-tuning or labeled training data. Our framework achieves strong performance on multiple datasets. On the LOGIC dataset, NL2FOL achieves an F1-score of 78%, while generalizing effectively to the LOGICCLIMATE dataset with an F1-score of 80%.</description>

      <title>Distributed Speculative Inference (DSI): Speculation Parallelism for Provably Faster Lossless Language Model Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14105v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces distributed speculative inference (DSI), a novel inference algorithm that is provably faster than speculative inference (SI) [leviathan2023, chen2023, miao2024, sun2025, timor2025] and standard autoregressive inference (non-SI). Like other SI algorithms, DSI operates on frozen language models (LMs), requiring no training or architectural modifications, and it preserves the target distribution. Prior studies on SI have demonstrated empirical speedups over non-SI--but rely on sufficiently fast and accurate drafters, which are often unavailable in practice. We identify a gap where SI can be slower than non-SI if drafters are too slow or inaccurate. We close this gap by proving that DSI is faster than both SI and non-SI--given any drafters. DSI is therefore not only faster than SI, but also unlocks the acceleration of LMs for which SI fails. DSI leverages speculation parallelism (SP), a novel type of task parallelism, to orchestrate target and drafter instances that overlap in time, establishing a new foundational tradeoff between computational resources and latency. Our simulations show that DSI is 1.29-1.92x faster than SI in single-node setups for various off-the-shelf LMs and tasks. We open-source all our code.</description>

      <title>MallowsPO: Fine-Tune Your LLM with Preference Dispersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14953v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a popular approach to improve reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), leading to better techniques to fine-tune large language models (LLM). A weakness of DPO, however, lies in its lack of capability to characterize the diversity of human preferences. Inspired by Mallows' theory of preference ranking, we develop in this paper a new approach, the MallowsPO. A distinct feature of this approach is a dispersion index, which reflects the dispersion of human preference to prompts. We show that existing DPO models can be reduced to special cases of this dispersion index, thus unified with MallowsPO. More importantly, we demonstrate (empirically) how to use this dispersion index to enhance the performance of DPO in a broad array of benchmark tasks, from synthetic bandit selection to controllable generations and dialogues, while maintaining great generalization capabilities. MallowsPO is also compatible with other SOTA offline preference optimization methods, boosting nearly 2\% extra LC win rate when used as a plugin for fine-tuning Llama3-Instruct.</description>

      <title>MCDFN: Supply Chain Demand Forecasting via an Explainable Multi-Channel Data Fusion Network Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15598v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is crucial for optimizing supply chain management. Traditional methods often fail to capture complex patterns from seasonal variability and special events. Despite advancements in deep learning, interpretable forecasting models remain a challenge. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Channel Data Fusion Network (MCDFN), a hybrid architecture that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to enhance predictive performance by extracting spatial and temporal features from time series data. Our comparative benchmarking demonstrates that MCDFN outperforms seven other deep-learning models, achieving superior metrics: MSE (23.5738), RMSE (4.8553), MAE (3.9991), and MAPE (20.1575%). Theil's U statistic of 0.1181 (U&lt;1) of MCDFN indicates its superiority over the naive forecasting approach, and a 10-fold cross-validated statistical paired t-test with a p-value of 5% indicated no significant difference between MCDFN's predictions and actual values. We apply explainable AI techniques like ShapTime and Permutation Feature Importance to enhance interpretability. This research advances demand forecasting methodologies and offers practical guidelines for integrating MCDFN into supply chain systems, highlighting future research directions for scalability and user-friendly deployment.</description>

      <title>Adaptive $Q$-Network: On-the-fly Target Selection for Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is well known for being highly sensitive to hyperparameters, requiring practitioners substantial efforts to optimize them for the problem at hand. This also limits the applicability of RL in real-world scenarios. In recent years, the field of automated Reinforcement Learning (AutoRL) has grown in popularity by trying to address this issue. However, these approaches typically hinge on additional samples to select well-performing hyperparameters, hindering sample-efficiency and practicality. Furthermore, most AutoRL methods are heavily based on already existing AutoML methods, which were originally developed neglecting the additional challenges inherent to RL due to its non-stationarities. In this work, we propose a new approach for AutoRL, called Adaptive $Q$-Network (AdaQN), that is tailored to RL to take into account the non-stationarity of the optimization procedure without requiring additional samples. AdaQN learns several $Q$-functions, each one trained with different hyperparameters, which are updated online using the $Q$-function with the smallest approximation error as a shared target. Our selection scheme simultaneously handles different hyperparameters while coping with the non-stationarity induced by the RL optimization procedure and being orthogonal to any critic-based RL algorithm. We demonstrate that AdaQN is theoretically sound and empirically validate it in MuJoCo control problems and Atari $2600$ games, showing benefits in sample-efficiency, overall performance, robustness to stochasticity and training stability.</description>

      <title>Towards Better Chain-of-Thought: A Reflection on Effectiveness and Faithfulness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting demonstrates varying performance under different reasoning tasks. Previous work attempts to evaluate it but falls short in providing an in-depth analysis of patterns that influence the CoT. In this paper, we study the CoT performance from the perspective of effectiveness and faithfulness. For the former, we identify key factors that influence CoT effectiveness on performance improvement, including problem difficulty, information gain, and information flow. For the latter, we interpret the unfaithful CoT issue by conducting a joint analysis of the information interaction among the question, CoT, and answer. The result demonstrates that, when the LLM predicts answers, it can recall correct information missing in the CoT from the question, leading to the problem. Finally, we propose a novel algorithm to mitigate this issue, in which we recall extra information from the question to enhance the CoT generation and evaluate CoTs based on their information gain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances both the faithfulness and effectiveness of CoT.</description>

      <title>ActionReasoningBench: Reasoning about Actions with and without Ramification Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04046v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reasoning about Actions and Change (RAC) has historically played a pivotal role in solving foundational AI problems, such as the frame problem. It has driven advancements in AI fields, such as non-monotonic and commonsense reasoning. RAC remains crucial for AI systems that operate in dynamic environments, engage in interactive scenarios, or rely on commonsense reasoning. Despite substantial advances made by Large Language Models (LLMs) in various AI domains, their performance in RAC remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a new diagnostic benchmark, ActionReasoningBench, which encompasses 8 domains and includes questions for up to 19 action sequences. This benchmark rigorously evaluates LLMs across six key RAC dimensions: Fluent Tracking, State Tracking, Action Executability, Effects of Actions, Numerical RAC, and Composite Questions. LLMs demonstrate average accuracy rates of 73.55%, 65.63%, 58.73%, and 62.38% on the former four dimensions, which are frequently discussed in RAC literature. However, the performance on the latter two dimensions, which introduce complex and novel reasoning questions, the average performance of LLMs is lowered to 33.16% and 51.19%, respectively, reflecting a 17.9% performance decline. We also introduce new ramification constraints to capture the indirect effects of actions, providing deeper insights into RAC challenges. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open-source and commercial models, reveals challenges across all RAC dimensions, particularly in handling ramifications, with GPT-4o failing to solve any question and o1-preview achieving a score of only 18.4%.</description>

Abstract: Skill discovery methods enable agents to learn diverse emergent behaviors without explicit rewards. To make learned skills useful for unknown downstream tasks, obtaining a semantically diverse repertoire of skills is essential. While some approaches introduce a discriminator to distinguish skills and others aim to increase state coverage, no existing work directly addresses the "semantic diversity" of skills. We hypothesize that leveraging the semantic knowledge of large language models (LLMs) can lead us to improve semantic diversity of resulting behaviors. In this sense, we introduce Language Guided Skill Discovery (LGSD), a skill discovery framework that aims to directly maximize the semantic diversity between skills. LGSD takes user prompts as input and outputs a set of semantically distinctive skills. The prompts serve as a means to constrain the search space into a semantically desired subspace, and the generated LLM outputs guide the agent to visit semantically diverse states within the subspace. We demonstrate that LGSD enables legged robots to visit different user-intended areas on a plane by simply changing the prompt. Furthermore, we show that language guidance aids in discovering more diverse skills compared to five existing skill discovery methods in robot-arm manipulation environments. Lastly, LGSD provides a simple way of utilizing learned skills via natural language.</description>

      <title>XLand-100B: A Large-Scale Multi-Task Dataset for In-Context Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the success of the in-context learning paradigm in large-scale language and computer vision models, the recently emerging field of in-context reinforcement learning is experiencing a rapid growth. However, its development has been held back by the lack of challenging benchmarks, as all the experiments have been carried out in simple environments and on small-scale datasets. We present XLand-100B, a large-scale dataset for in-context reinforcement learning based on the XLand-MiniGrid environment, as a first step to alleviate this problem. It contains complete learning histories for nearly $30,000$ different tasks, covering $100$B transitions and 2.5B episodes. It took 50,000 GPU hours to collect the dataset, which is beyond the reach of most academic labs. Along with the dataset, we provide the utilities to reproduce or expand it even further. We also benchmark common in-context RL baselines and show that they struggle to generalize to novel and diverse tasks. With this substantial effort, we aim to democratize research in the rapidly growing field of in-context reinforcement learning and provide a solid foundation for further scaling.</description>

      <title>IGL-Bench: Establishing the Comprehensive Benchmark for Imbalanced Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep graph learning has gained grand popularity over the past years due to its versatility and success in representing graph data across a wide range of domains. However, the pervasive issue of imbalanced graph data distributions, where certain parts exhibit disproportionally abundant data while others remain sparse, undermines the efficacy of conventional graph learning algorithms, leading to biased outcomes. To address this challenge, Imbalanced Graph Learning (IGL) has garnered substantial attention, enabling more balanced data distributions and better task performance. Despite the proliferation of IGL algorithms, the absence of consistent experimental protocols and fair performance comparisons pose a significant barrier to comprehending advancements in this field. To bridge this gap, we introduce IGL-Bench, a foundational comprehensive benchmark for imbalanced graph learning, embarking on 16 diverse graph datasets and 24 distinct IGL algorithms with uniform data processing and splitting strategies. Specifically, IGL-Bench systematically investigates state-of-the-art IGL algorithms in terms of effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency on node-level and graph-level tasks, with the scope of class-imbalance and topology-imbalance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the potential benefits of IGL algorithms on various imbalanced conditions, offering insights and opportunities in the IGL field. Further, we have developed an open-sourced and unified package to facilitate reproducible evaluation and inspire further innovative research, which is available at https://github.com/RingBDStack/IGL-Bench.</description>

      <title>We Have a Package for You! A Comprehensive Analysis of Package Hallucinations by Code Generating LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reliance of popular programming languages such as Python and JavaScript on centralized package repositories and open-source software, combined with the emergence of code-generating Large Language Models (LLMs), has created a new type of threat to the software supply chain: package hallucinations. These hallucinations, which arise from fact-conflicting errors when generating code using LLMs, represent a novel form of package confusion attack that poses a critical threat to the integrity of the software supply chain. This paper conducts a rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of package hallucinations across different programming languages, settings, and parameters, exploring how a diverse set of models and configurations affect the likelihood of generating erroneous package recommendations and identifying the root causes of this phenomenon. Using 16 popular LLMs for code generation and two unique prompt datasets, we generate 576,000 code samples in two programming languages that we analyze for package hallucinations. Our findings reveal that that the average percentage of hallucinated packages is at least 5.2% for commercial models and 21.7% for open-source models, including a staggering 205,474 unique examples of hallucinated package names, further underscoring the severity and pervasiveness of this threat. To overcome this problem, we implement several hallucination mitigation strategies and show that they are able to significantly reduce the number of package hallucinations while maintaining code quality. Our experiments and findings highlight package hallucinations as a persistent and systemic phenomenon while using state-of-the-art LLMs for code generation, and a significant challenge which deserves the research community's urgent attention.</description>

      <title>See It from My Perspective: How Language Affects Cultural Bias in Image Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) can respond to queries about images in many languages. However, beyond language, culture affects how we see things. For example, individuals from Western cultures focus more on the central figure in an image while individuals from East Asian cultures attend more to scene context. In this work, we characterize the Western bias of VLMs in image understanding and investigate the role that language plays in this disparity. We evaluate VLMs across subjective and objective visual tasks with culturally diverse images and annotations. We find that VLMs perform better on the Western split than on the East Asian split of each task. Through controlled experimentation, we trace one source of this bias in image understanding to the lack of diversity in language model construction. While inference in a language nearer to a culture can lead to reductions in bias, we show it is much more effective when that language was well-represented during text-only pre-training. Interestingly, this yields bias reductions even when prompting in English. Our work highlights the importance of richer representation of all languages in building equitable VLMs.</description>

      <title>Mixture-of-Subspaces in Low-Rank Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11909v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a subspace-inspired Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method, which is computationally efficient, easy to implement, and readily applicable to large language, multimodal, and diffusion models. Initially, we equivalently decompose the weights of LoRA into two subspaces, and find that simply mixing them can enhance performance. To study such a phenomenon, we revisit it through a fine-grained subspace lens, showing that such modification is equivalent to employing a fixed mixer to fuse the subspaces. To be more flexible, we jointly learn the mixer with the original LoRA weights, and term the method Mixture-of-Subspaces LoRA (MoSLoRA). MoSLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA on tasks in different modalities, including commonsense reasoning, visual instruction tuning, and subject-driven text-to-image generation, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. Codes are available at https://github.com/wutaiqiang/MoSLoRA.</description>

      <title>Identifying User Goals from UI Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying underlying user goals and intents has been recognized as valuable in various personalization-oriented settings, such as personalized agents, improved search responses, advertising, user analytics, and more. In this paper, we propose a new task goal identification from observed UI trajectories aiming to infer the user's detailed intentions when performing a task within UI environments. To support this task, we also introduce a novel evaluation methodology designed to assess whether two intent descriptions can be considered paraphrases within a specific UI environment. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this task can leverage datasets designed for the inverse problem of UI automation, utilizing Android and web datasets for our experiments. To benchmark this task, we compare the performance of humans and state-of-the-art models, specifically GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5 Pro, using our proposed metric. The results reveal that both Gemini and GPT underperform relative to human performance, underscoring the challenge of the proposed task and the significant room for improvement. This work highlights the importance of goal identification within UI trajectories, providing a foundation for further exploration and advancement in this area.</description>

      <title>ACES: Automatic Cohort Extraction System for Event-Stream Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19653v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reproducibility remains a significant challenge in machine learning (ML) for healthcare. Datasets, model pipelines, and even task or cohort definitions are often private in this field, leading to a significant barrier in sharing, iterating, and understanding ML results on electronic health record (EHR) datasets. We address a significant part of this problem by introducing the Automatic Cohort Extraction System (ACES) for event-stream data. This library is designed to simultaneously simplify the development of tasks and cohorts for ML in healthcare and also enable their reproduction, both at an exact level for single datasets and at a conceptual level across datasets. To accomplish this, ACES provides: (1) a highly intuitive and expressive domain-specific configuration language for defining both dataset-specific concepts and dataset-agnostic inclusion or exclusion criteria, and (2) a pipeline to automatically extract patient records that meet these defined criteria from real-world data. ACES can be automatically applied to any dataset in either the Medical Event Data Standard (MEDS) or Event Stream GPT (ESGPT) formats, or to *any* dataset in which the necessary task-specific predicates can be extracted in an event-stream form. ACES has the potential to significantly lower the barrier to entry for defining ML tasks in representation learning, redefine the way researchers interact with EHR datasets, and significantly improve the state of reproducibility for ML studies using this modality. ACES is available at: https://github.com/justin13601/aces.</description>

      <title>Iterative Nash Policy Optimization: Aligning LLMs with General Preferences via No-Regret Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00617v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has achieved great success in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Prevalent RLHF approaches are reward-based, following the Bradley-Terry (BT) model assumption, which may not fully capture the complexity of human preferences. In this paper, we explore RLHF under a general preference framework and approach it from a game-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a two-player game and propose a novel online algorithm, iterative Nash policy optimization (INPO). The key idea is to let the policy play against itself via no-regret learning, thereby approximating the Nash policy. Unlike previous methods, INPO bypasses the need for estimating the expected win rate for individual responses, which typically incurs high computational or annotation costs. Instead, we introduce a new loss objective that is directly minimized over a preference dataset. We provide theoretical analysis for our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on various representative benchmarks. With an LLaMA-3-8B-based SFT model, INPO achieves a 42.6% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 and a 37.8% win rate on Arena-Hard, showing substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art online RLHF algorithms.</description>

      <title>SeqAR: Jailbreak LLMs with Sequential Auto-Generated Characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread applications of large language models (LLMs) have brought about concerns regarding their potential misuse. Although aligned with human preference data before release, LLMs remain vulnerable to various malicious attacks. In this paper, we adopt a red-teaming strategy to enhance LLM safety and introduce SeqAR, a simple yet effective framework to design jailbreak prompts automatically. The SeqAR framework generates and optimizes multiple jailbreak characters and then applies sequential jailbreak characters in a single query to bypass the guardrails of the target LLM. Different from previous work which relies on proprietary LLMs or seed jailbreak templates crafted by human expertise, SeqAR can generate and optimize the jailbreak prompt in a cold-start scenario using open-sourced LLMs without any seed jailbreak templates. Experimental results show that SeqAR achieves attack success rates of 88% and 60% in bypassing the safety alignment of GPT-3.5-1106 and GPT-4, respectively. Furthermore, we extensively evaluate the transferability of the generated templates across different LLMs and held-out malicious requests, while also exploring defense strategies against the jailbreak attack designed by SeqAR.</description>

      <title>Efficient Imitation Without Demonstrations via Value-Penalized Auxiliary Control from Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Common approaches to providing feedback in reinforcement learning are the use of hand-crafted rewards or full-trajectory expert demonstrations. Alternatively, one can use examples of completed tasks, but such an approach can be extremely sample inefficient. We introduce value-penalized auxiliary control from examples (VPACE), an algorithm that significantly improves exploration in example-based control by adding examples of simple auxiliary tasks and an above-success-level value penalty. Across both simulated and real robotic environments, we show that our approach substantially improves learning efficiency for challenging tasks, while maintaining bounded value estimates. Preliminary results also suggest that VPACE may learn more efficiently than the more common approaches of using full trajectories or true sparse rewards.

      <title>Unsupervised Disentanglement of Content and Style via Variance-Invariance Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We contribute an unsupervised method that effectively learns disentangled content and style representations from sequences of observations. Unlike most disentanglement algorithms that rely on domain-specific labels or knowledge, our method is based on the insight of domain-general statistical differences between content and style -- content varies more among different fragments within a sample but maintains an invariant vocabulary across data samples, whereas style remains relatively invariant within a sample but exhibits more significant variation across different samples. We integrate such inductive bias into an encoder-decoder architecture and name our method after V3 (variance-versus-invariance). Experimental results show that V3 generalizes across multiple domains and modalities, successfully learning disentangled content and style representations, such as pitch and timbre from music audio, digit and color from images of hand-written digits, and action and character appearance from simple animations. V3 demonstrates strong disentanglement performance compared to existing unsupervised methods, along with superior out-of-distribution generalization under few-shot adaptation compared to supervised counterparts. Lastly, symbolic-level interpretability emerges in the learned content codebook, forging a near one-to-one alignment between machine representation and human knowledge.</description>

      <title>Tackling Data Corruption in Offline Reinforcement Learning via Sequence Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04285v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning policy from offline datasets through offline reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for scaling data-driven decision-making while avoiding unsafe and costly online interactions. However, real-world data collected from sensors or humans often contains noise and errors, posing a significant challenge for existing offline RL methods, particularly when the real-world data is limited. Our study reveals that prior research focusing on adapting predominant offline RL methods based on temporal difference learning still falls short under data corruption when the dataset is limited. In contrast, we discover that vanilla sequence modeling methods, such as Decision Transformer, exhibit robustness against data corruption, even without specialized modifications. To unlock the full potential of sequence modeling, we propose Robust Decision Rransformer (RDT) by incorporating three simple yet effective robust techniques: embedding dropout to improve the model's robustness against erroneous inputs, Gaussian weighted learning to mitigate the effects of corrupted labels, and iterative data correction to eliminate corrupted data from the source. Extensive experiments on MuJoCo, Kitchen, and Adroit tasks demonstrate RDT's superior performance under various data corruption scenarios compared to prior methods. Furthermore, RDT exhibits remarkable robustness in a more challenging setting that combines training-time data corruption with test-time observation perturbations. These results highlight the potential of sequence modeling for learning from noisy or corrupted offline datasets, thereby promoting the reliable application of offline RL in real-world scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/jiawei415/RobustDecisionTransformer.</description>

      <title>Discovering physical laws with parallel combinatorial tree search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symbolic regression plays a crucial role in modern scientific research thanks to its capability of discovering concise and interpretable mathematical expressions from data. A grand challenge lies in the arduous search for parsimonious and generalizable mathematical formulas, in an infinite search space, while intending to fit the training data. Existing algorithms have faced a critical bottleneck of accuracy and efficiency over a decade when handling problems of complexity, which essentially hinders the pace of applying symbolic regression for scientific exploration across interdisciplinary domains. To this end, we introduce a parallel combinatorial tree search (PCTS) model to efficiently distill generic mathematical expressions from limited data. Through a series of extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior accuracy and efficiency of PCTS for equation discovery, which greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline models on over 200 synthetic and experimental datasets (e.g., lifting its performance by up to 99% accuracy improvement and one-order of magnitude speed up). PCTS represents a key advance in accurate and efficient data-driven discovery of symbolic, interpretable models (e.g., underlying physical laws) and marks a pivotal transition towards scalable symbolic learning.</description>

      <title>Greener GRASS: Enhancing GNNs with Encoding, Rewiring, and Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05649v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become important tools for machine learning on graph-structured data. In this paper, we explore the synergistic combination of graph encoding, graph rewiring, and graph attention, by introducing Graph Attention with Stochastic Structures (GRASS), a novel GNN architecture. GRASS utilizes relative random walk probabilities (RRWP) encoding and a novel decomposed variant (D-RRWP) to efficiently capture structural information. It rewires the input graph by superimposing a random regular graph to enhance long-range information propagation. It also employs a novel additive attention mechanism tailored for graph-structured data. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that GRASS achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, including a 20.3% reduction in mean absolute error on the ZINC dataset.</description>

      <title>Variational Best-of-N Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Best-of-N (BoN) is a popular and effective algorithm for aligning language models to human preferences. The algorithm works as follows: at inference time, N samples are drawn from the language model, and the sample with the highest reward, as judged by a reward model, is returned as the output. Despite its effectiveness, BoN is computationally expensive; it reduces sampling throughput by a factor of N. To make BoN more efficient at inference time, one strategy is to fine-tune the language model to mimic what BoN does during inference. To achieve this, we derive the distribution induced by the BoN algorithm. We then propose to fine-tune the language model to minimize backward KL divergence to the BoN distribution. Our approach is analogous to mean-field variational inference and, thus, we term it variational BoN (vBoN). To the extent this fine-tuning is successful and we end up with a good approximation, we have reduced the inference cost by a factor of N. Our experiments on controlled generation and summarization tasks show that BoN is the most effective alignment method, and our variational approximation to BoN achieves the closest performance to BoN and surpasses models fine-tuned using the standard KL-constrained RL objective. In the controlled generation task, vBoN appears more frequently on the Pareto frontier of reward and KL divergence compared to other alignment methods. In the summarization task, vBoN achieves high reward values across various sampling temperatures.</description>

      <title>BECAUSE: Bilinear Causal Representation for Generalizable Offline Model-based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) enhances data efficiency by utilizing pre-collected datasets to learn models and policies, especially in scenarios where exploration is costly or infeasible. Nevertheless, its performance often suffers from the objective mismatch between model and policy learning, resulting in inferior performance despite accurate model predictions. This paper first identifies the primary source of this mismatch comes from the underlying confounders present in offline data for MBRL. Subsequently, we introduce \textbf{B}ilin\textbf{E}ar \textbf{CAUS}al r\textbf{E}presentation~(BECAUSE), an algorithm to capture causal representation for both states and actions to reduce the influence of the distribution shift, thus mitigating the objective mismatch problem. Comprehensive evaluations on 18 tasks that vary in data quality and environment context demonstrate the superior performance of BECAUSE over existing offline RL algorithms. We show the generalizability and robustness of BECAUSE under fewer samples or larger numbers of confounders. Additionally, we offer theoretical analysis of BECAUSE to prove its error bound and sample efficiency when integrating causal representation into offline MBRL.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Representations through Multi-task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent perception and interaction with the world hinges on internal representations that capture its underlying structure (''disentangled'' or ''abstract'' representations). Disentangled representations serve as world models, isolating latent factors of variation in the world along approximately orthogonal directions, thus facilitating feature-based generalization. We provide experimental and theoretical results guaranteeing the emergence of disentangled representations in agents that optimally solve multi-task evidence accumulation classification tasks, canonical in the neuroscience literature. The key conceptual finding is that, by producing accurate multi-task classification estimates, a system implicitly represents a set of coordinates specifying a disentangled representation of the underlying latent state of the data it receives. The theory provides conditions for the emergence of these representations in terms of noise, number of tasks, and evidence accumulation time. We experimentally validate these predictions in RNNs trained to multi-task, which learn disentangled representations in the form of continuous attractors, leading to zero-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in predicting latent factors. We demonstrate the robustness of our framework across autoregressive architectures, decision boundary geometries and in tasks requiring classification confidence estimation. We find that transformers are particularly suited for disentangling representations, which might explain their unique world understanding abilities. Overall, our framework establishes a formal link between competence at multiple tasks and the formation of disentangled, interpretable world models in both biological and artificial systems, and helps explain why ANNs often arrive at human-interpretable concepts, and how they both may acquire exceptional zero-shot generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Semantic Operators: A Declarative Model for Rich, AI-based Data Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11418v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The semantic capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enable rich analytics and reasoning over vast knowledge corpora. Unfortunately, existing systems either empirically optimize expensive LLM-powered operations with no performance guarantees, or serve a limited set of row-wise LLM operations, providing limited robustness, expressiveness and usability. We introduce semantic operators, the first formalism for declarative and general-purpose AI-based transformations based on natural language specifications (e.g., filtering, sorting, joining or aggregating records using natural language criteria). Each operator opens a rich space for execution plans, similar to relational operators. Our model specifies the expected behavior of each operator with a high-quality gold algorithm, and we develop an optimization framework that reduces cost, while providing accuracy guarantees with respect to a gold algorithm. Using this approach, we propose several novel optimizations to accelerate semantic filtering, joining, group-by and top-k operations by up to $1,000\times$. We implement semantic operators in the LOTUS system and demonstrate LOTUS' effectiveness on real, bulk-semantic processing applications, including fact-checking, biomedical multi-label classification, search, and topic analysis. We show that the semantic operator model is expressive, capturing state-of-the-art AI pipelines in a few operator calls, and making it easy to express new pipelines that match or exceed quality of recent LLM-based analytic systems by up to $170\%$, while offering accuracy guarantees. Overall, LOTUS programs match or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art AI pipelines for each task while running up to $3.6\times$ faster than the highest-quality baselines. LOTUS is publicly available at https://github.com/lotus-data/lotus.</description>

      <title>Unmasking Social Bots: How Confident Are We?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social bots remain a major vector for spreading disinformation on social media and a menace to the public. Despite the progress made in developing multiple sophisticated social bot detection algorithms and tools, bot detection remains a challenging, unsolved problem that is fraught with uncertainty due to the heterogeneity of bot behaviors, training data, and detection algorithms. Detection models often disagree on whether to label the same account as bot or human-controlled. However, they do not provide any measure of uncertainty to indicate how much we should trust their results. We propose to address both bot detection and the quantification of uncertainty at the account level - a novel feature of this research. This dual focus is crucial as it allows us to leverage additional information related to the quantified uncertainty of each prediction, thereby enhancing decision-making and improving the reliability of bot classifications. Specifically, our approach facilitates targeted interventions for bots when predictions are made with high confidence and suggests caution (e.g., gathering more data) when predictions are uncertain.</description>

      <title>Improving Representation of High-frequency Components for Medical Visual Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have recently attracted significant attention for their impressive generalizability across diverse downstream tasks. However, these models are demonstrated to exhibit great limitations in representing high-frequency components and fine-grained details. In many medical imaging tasks, the precise representation of such information is crucial due to the inherently intricate anatomical structures, sub-visual features, and complex boundaries involved. Consequently, the limited representation of prevalent foundation models can result in significant performance degradation or even failure in these tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pretraining strategy, named Frequency-advanced Representation Autoencoder (Frepa). Through high-frequency masking and low-frequency perturbation combined with adversarial learning, Frepa encourages the encoder to effectively represent and preserve high-frequency components in the image embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an innovative histogram-equalized image masking strategy, extending the Masked Autoencoder approach beyond ViT to other architectures such as Swin Transformer and convolutional networks. We develop Frepa across nine medical modalities and validate it on 32 downstream tasks for both 2D images and 3D volume data. Without fine-tuning, Frepa can outperform other self-supervised pretraining methods and, in some cases, even surpasses task-specific trained models. This improvement is particularly significant for tasks involving fine-grained details, such as achieving up to a +15% increase in DSC for retina vessel segmentation and a +7% increase in IoU for lung nodule detection. Further experiments quantitatively reveal that Frepa enables superior high-frequency representations and preservation in the embeddings, underscoring its potential for developing more generalized and universal medical image foundation models.</description>

      <title>POGEMA: A Benchmark Platform for Cooperative Multi-Agent Pathfinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has recently excelled in solving challenging cooperative and competitive multi-agent problems in various environments, typically involving a small number of agents and full observability. Moreover, a range of crucial robotics-related tasks, such as multi-robot pathfinding, which have traditionally been approached with classical non-learnable methods (e.g., heuristic search), are now being suggested for solution using learning-based or hybrid methods. However, in this domain, it remains difficult, if not impossible, to conduct a fair comparison between classical, learning-based, and hybrid approaches due to the lack of a unified framework that supports both learning and evaluation. To address this, we introduce POGEMA, a comprehensive set of tools that includes a fast environment for learning, a problem instance generator, a collection of predefined problem instances, a visualization toolkit, and a benchmarking tool for automated evaluation. We also introduce and define an evaluation protocol that specifies a range of domain-related metrics, computed based on primary evaluation indicators (such as success rate and path length), enabling a fair multi-fold comparison. The results of this comparison, which involves a variety of state-of-the-art MARL, search-based, and hybrid methods, are presented.</description>

      <title>Generalization v.s. Memorization: Tracing Language Models' Capabilities Back to Pretraining Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14985v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked debate over whether these models genuinely generalize to unseen tasks or predominantly rely on memorizing vast amounts of pretraining data. To explore this issue, we introduce an extended concept of memorization, distributional memorization, which measures the correlation between the LLM output probabilities and the pretraining data frequency. To effectively capture task-specific pretraining data frequency, we propose a novel task-gram language model, which is built by counting the co-occurrence of semantically related $n$-gram pairs from task inputs and outputs in the pretraining corpus. Using the Pythia models trained on the Pile dataset, we evaluate four distinct tasks: machine translation, factual question answering, world knowledge understanding, and math reasoning. Our findings reveal varying levels of memorization, with the strongest effect observed in factual question answering. Furthermore, while model performance improves across all tasks as LLM size increases, only factual question answering shows an increase in memorization, whereas machine translation and reasoning tasks exhibit greater generalization, producing more novel outputs. This study demonstrates that memorization plays a larger role in simpler, knowledge-intensive tasks, while generalization is the key for harder, reasoning-based tasks, providing a scalable method for analyzing large pretraining corpora in greater depth.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Robotic Swarms: A Corroborative Approach for Verification and Validation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergent behaviour of autonomous robotic swarms poses a significant challenge to their safety assurance. Assurance tasks encompass adherence to standards, certification processes, and the execution of verification and validation (V&amp;V) methods, such as model checking. In this study, we propose a corroborative approach for formally verifying and validating autonomous robotic swarms, which are defined at the macroscopic formal modelling, low-fidelity simulation, high-fidelity simulation, and real-robot levels. Our formal macroscopic models, used for verification, are characterised by data derived from actual simulations to ensure both accuracy and traceability across different swarm system models. Furthermore, our work combines formal verification with simulations and experimental validation using real robots. In this way, our corroborative approach for V&amp;V seeks to enhance confidence in the evidence, in contrast to employing these methods separately. We explore our approach through a case study focused on a swarm of robots operating within a public cloakroom.</description>

      <title>QAEA-DR: A Unified Text Augmentation Framework for Dense Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In dense retrieval, embedding long texts into dense vectors can result in information loss, leading to inaccurate query-text matching. Additionally, low-quality texts with excessive noise or sparse key information are unlikely to align well with relevant queries. Recent studies mainly focus on improving the sentence embedding model or retrieval process. In this work, we introduce a novel text augmentation framework for dense retrieval. This framework transforms raw documents into information-dense text formats, which supplement the original texts to effectively address the aforementioned issues without modifying embedding or retrieval methodologies. Two text representations are generated via large language models (LLMs) zero-shot prompting: question-answer pairs and element-driven events. We term this approach QAEA-DR: unifying question-answer generation and event extraction in a text augmentation framework for dense retrieval. To further enhance the quality of generated texts, a scoring-based evaluation and regeneration mechanism is introduced in LLM prompting. Our QAEA-DR model has a positive impact on dense retrieval, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical experiments.</description>

      <title>Prompting Medical Large Vision-Language Models to Diagnose Pathologies by Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant success in recent years, and they have been extended to the medical domain. Although demonstrating satisfactory performance on medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, Medical LVLMs (MLVLMs) suffer from the hallucination problem, which makes them fail to diagnose complex pathologies. Moreover, they readily fail to learn minority pathologies due to imbalanced training data. We propose two prompting strategies for MLVLMs that reduce hallucination and improve VQA performance. In the first strategy, we provide a detailed explanation of the queried pathology. In the second strategy, we fine-tune a cheap, weak learner to achieve high performance on a specific metric, and textually provide its judgment to the MLVLM. Tested on the MIMIC-CXR-JPG and Chexpert datasets, our methods significantly improve the diagnostic F1 score, with the highest increase being 0.27. We also demonstrate that our prompting strategies can be extended to general LVLM domains. Based on POPE metrics, it effectively suppresses the false negative predictions of existing LVLMs and improves Recall by approximately 0.07.</description>

      <title>Empathy Level Alignment via Reinforcement Learning for Empathetic Response Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empathetic response generation, aiming to understand the user's situation and feelings and respond empathically, is crucial in building human-like dialogue systems. Traditional approaches typically employ maximum likelihood estimation as the optimization objective during training, yet fail to align the empathy levels between generated and target responses. To this end, we propose an empathetic response generation framework using reinforcement learning (EmpRL). The framework develops an effective empathy reward function and generates empathetic responses by maximizing the expected reward through reinforcement learning. EmpRL utilizes the pre-trained T5 model as the generator and further fine-tunes it to initialize the policy. To align the empathy levels between generated and target responses within a given context, an empathy reward function containing three empathy communication mechanisms -- emotional reaction, interpretation, and exploration -- is constructed using pre-designed and pre-trained empathy identifiers. During reinforcement learning training, the proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to fine-tune the policy, enabling the generation of empathetic responses. Both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that the proposed EmpRL framework significantly improves the quality of generated responses, enhances the similarity in empathy levels between generated and target responses, and produces empathetic responses covering both affective and cognitive aspects.</description>

      <title>HiLo: A Learning Framework for Generalized Category Discovery Robust to Domain Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is a challenging task in which, given a partially labelled dataset, models must categorize all unlabelled instances, regardless of whether they come from labelled categories or from new ones. In this paper, we challenge a remaining assumption in this task: that all images share the same domain. Specifically, we introduce a new task and method to handle GCD when the unlabelled data also contains images from different domains to the labelled set. Our proposed `HiLo' networks extract High-level semantic and Low-level domain features, before minimizing the mutual information between the representations. Our intuition is that the clusterings based on domain information and semantic information should be independent. We further extend our method with a specialized domain augmentation tailored for the GCD task, as well as a curriculum learning approach. Finally, we construct a benchmark from corrupted fine-grained datasets as well as a large-scale evaluation on DomainNet with real-world domain shifts, reimplementing a number of GCD baselines in this setting. We demonstrate that HiLo outperforms SoTA category discovery models by a large margin on all evaluations.</description>

      <title>Building Trust in Mental Health Chatbots: Safety Metrics and LLM-Based Evaluation Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: This study aims to develop and validate an evaluation framework to ensure the safety and reliability of mental health chatbots, which are increasingly popular due to their accessibility, human-like interactions, and context-aware support. Materials and Methods: We created an evaluation framework with 100 benchmark questions and ideal responses, and five guideline questions for chatbot responses. This framework, validated by mental health experts, was tested on a GPT-3.5-turbo-based chatbot. Automated evaluation methods explored included large language model (LLM)-based scoring, an agentic approach using real-time data, and embedding models to compare chatbot responses against ground truth standards. Results: The results highlight the importance of guidelines and ground truth for improving LLM evaluation accuracy. The agentic method, dynamically accessing reliable information, demonstrated the best alignment with human assessments. Adherence to a standardized, expert-validated framework significantly enhanced chatbot response safety and reliability. Discussion: Our findings emphasize the need for comprehensive, expert-tailored safety evaluation metrics for mental health chatbots. While LLMs have significant potential, careful implementation is necessary to mitigate risks. The superior performance of the agentic approach underscores the importance of real-time data access in enhancing chatbot reliability. Conclusion: The study validated an evaluation framework for mental health chatbots, proving its effectiveness in improving safety and reliability. Future work should extend evaluations to accuracy, bias, empathy, and privacy to ensure holistic assessment and responsible integration into healthcare. Standardized evaluations will build trust among users and professionals, facilitating broader adoption and improved mental health support through technology.</description>

      <title>Snuffy: Efficient Whole Slide Image Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification with multiple instance learning (MIL) in digital pathology faces significant computational challenges. Current methods mostly rely on extensive self-supervised learning (SSL) for satisfactory performance, requiring long training periods and considerable computational resources. At the same time, no pre-training affects performance due to domain shifts from natural images to WSIs. We introduce Snuffy architecture, a novel MIL-pooling method based on sparse transformers that mitigates performance loss with limited pre-training and enables continual few-shot pre-training as a competitive option. Our sparsity pattern is tailored for pathology and is theoretically proven to be a universal approximator with the tightest probabilistic sharp bound on the number of layers for sparse transformers, to date. We demonstrate Snuffy's effectiveness on CAMELYON16 and TCGA Lung cancer datasets, achieving superior WSI and patch-level accuracies. The code is available on https://github.com/jafarinia/snuffy.</description>

      <title>Detecting Unsuccessful Students in Cybersecurity Exercises in Two Different Learning Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This full paper in the research track evaluates the usage of data logged from cybersecurity exercises in order to predict students who are potentially at risk of performing poorly. Hands-on exercises are essential for learning since they enable students to practice their skills. In cybersecurity, hands-on exercises are often complex and require knowledge of many topics. Therefore, students may miss solutions due to gaps in their knowledge and become frustrated, which impedes their learning. Targeted aid by the instructor helps, but since the instructor's time is limited, efficient ways to detect struggling students are needed. This paper develops automated tools to predict when a student is having difficulty. We formed a dataset with the actions of 313 students from two countries and two learning environments: KYPO CRP and EDURange. These data are used in machine learning algorithms to predict the success of students in exercises deployed in these environments. After extracting features from the data, we trained and cross-validated eight classifiers for predicting the exercise outcome and evaluated their predictive power. The contribution of this paper is comparing two approaches to feature engineering, modeling, and classification performance on data from two learning environments. Using the features from either learning environment, we were able to detect and distinguish between successful and struggling students. A decision tree classifier achieved the highest balanced accuracy and sensitivity with data from both learning environments. The results show that activity data from cybersecurity exercises are suitable for predicting student success. In a potential application, such models can aid instructors in detecting struggling students and providing targeted help. We publish data and code for building these models so that others can adopt or adapt them.</description>

      <title>Eagle: Exploring The Design Space for Multimodal LLMs with Mixture of Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret complex visual information is a crucial topic of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Recent work indicates that enhanced visual perception significantly reduces hallucinations and improves performance on resolution-sensitive tasks, such as optical character recognition and document analysis. A number of recent MLLMs achieve this goal using a mixture of vision encoders. Despite their success, there is a lack of systematic comparisons and detailed ablation studies addressing critical aspects, such as expert selection and the integration of multiple vision experts. This study provides an extensive exploration of the design space for MLLMs using a mixture of vision encoders and resolutions. Our findings reveal several underlying principles common to various existing strategies, leading to a streamlined yet effective design approach. We discover that simply concatenating visual tokens from a set of complementary vision encoders is as effective as more complex mixing architectures or strategies. We additionally introduce Pre-Alignment to bridge the gap between vision-focused encoders and language tokens, enhancing model coherence. The resulting family of MLLMs, Eagle, surpasses other leading open-source models on major MLLM benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Path-Consistency: Prefix Enhancement for Efficient Inference in LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), self-consistency has gained significant popularity by combining multiple sampling with majority voting. However, the state-of-the-art self-consistency approaches consume substantial computational resources and lead to significant additional time costs due to the multiple sampling. This prevents its full potential from being realized in scenarios where computational resources are critical. To improve the inference efficiency, this paper introduces \textit{path-consistency}, a method that leverages the confidence of answers generated in earlier branches to identify the prefix of the most promising path. By dynamically guiding the generation of subsequent branches based on this prefix, the \textit{path-consistency} mitigates both the errors and redundancies from random or less useful sampling in self-consistency. As a result, it can significantly accelerate the inference process by reducing the number of tokens generated. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that the \textit{path-consistency} achieves significant acceleration in inference latency ranging from $7.8\%$ to $40.5\%$, while maintaining or even improving task accuracy across different datasets, including mathematical reasoning, common sense reasoning, symbolic reasoning, and code generation.</description>

Abstract: We introduce OLMoE, a fully open, state-of-the-art language model leveraging sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). OLMoE-1B-7B has 7 billion (B) parameters but uses only 1B per input token. We pretrain it on 5 trillion tokens and further adapt it to create OLMoE-1B-7B-Instruct. Our models outperform all available models with similar active parameters, even surpassing larger ones like Llama2-13B-Chat and DeepSeekMoE-16B. We present various experiments on MoE training, analyze routing in our model showing high specialization, and open-source all aspects of our work: model weights, training data, code, and logs.</description>

      <title>Safeguarding AI Agents: Developing and Analyzing Safety Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03793v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI agents, specifically powered by large language models, have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in various applications where precision and efficacy are necessary. However, these agents come with inherent risks, including the potential for unsafe or biased actions, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, lack of transparency, and tendency to generate hallucinations. As AI agents become more prevalent in critical sectors of the industry, the implementation of effective safety protocols becomes increasingly important. This paper addresses the critical need for safety measures in AI systems, especially ones that collaborate with human teams. We propose and evaluate three frameworks to enhance safety protocols in AI agent systems: an LLM-powered input-output filter, a safety agent integrated within the system, and a hierarchical delegation-based system with embedded safety checks. Our methodology involves implementing these frameworks and testing them against a set of unsafe agentic use cases, providing a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness in mitigating risks associated with AI agent deployment. We conclude that these frameworks can significantly strengthen the safety and security of AI agent systems, minimizing potential harmful actions or outputs. Our work contributes to the ongoing effort to create safe and reliable AI applications, particularly in automated operations, and provides a foundation for developing robust guardrails to ensure the responsible use of AI agents in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalizable Scene Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06214v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While current state-of-the-art Scene Change Detection (SCD) approaches achieve impressive results in well-trained research data, they become unreliable under unseen environments and different temporal conditions; in-domain performance drops from 77.6\% to 8.0\% in a previously unseen environment and to 4.6\% under a different temporal condition -- calling for generalizable SCD and benchmark. In this work, we propose the Generalizable Scene Change Detection Framework (GeSCF), which addresses unseen domain performance and temporal consistency -- to meet the growing demand for anything SCD. Our method leverages the pre-trained Segment Anything Model (SAM) in a zero-shot manner. For this, we design Initial Pseudo-mask Generation and Geometric-Semantic Mask Matching -- seamlessly turning user-guided prompt and single-image based segmentation into scene change detection for a pair of inputs without guidance. Furthermore, we define the Generalizable Scene Change Detection (GeSCD) benchmark along with novel metrics and an evaluation protocol to facilitate SCD research in generalizability. In the process, we introduce the ChangeVPR dataset, a collection of challenging image pairs with diverse environmental scenarios -- including urban, suburban, and rural settings. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate that GeSCF achieves an average performance gain of 19.2\% on existing SCD datasets and 30.0\% on the ChangeVPR dataset, nearly doubling the prior art performance. We believe our work can lay a solid foundation for robust and generalizable SCD research.</description>

      <title>LLaMA-Omni: Seamless Speech Interaction with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models like GPT-4o enable real-time interaction with large language models (LLMs) through speech, significantly enhancing user experience compared to traditional text-based interaction. However, there is still a lack of exploration on how to build speech interaction models based on open-source LLMs. To address this, we propose LLaMA-Omni, a novel model architecture designed for low-latency and high-quality speech interaction with LLMs. LLaMA-Omni integrates a pretrained speech encoder, a speech adaptor, an LLM, and a streaming speech decoder. It eliminates the need for speech transcription, and can simultaneously generate text and speech responses directly from speech instructions with extremely low latency. We build our model based on the latest Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model. To align the model with speech interaction scenarios, we construct a dataset named InstructS2S-200K, which includes 200K speech instructions and corresponding speech responses. Experimental results show that compared to previous speech-language models, LLaMA-Omni provides better responses in both content and style, with a response latency as low as 226ms. Additionally, training LLaMA-Omni takes less than 3 days on just 4 GPUs, paving the way for the efficient development of speech-language models in the future.</description>

      <title>One Map to Find Them All: Real-time Open-Vocabulary Mapping for Zero-shot Multi-Object Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The capability to efficiently search for objects in complex environments is fundamental for many real-world robot applications. Recent advances in open-vocabulary vision models have resulted in semantically-informed object navigation methods that allow a robot to search for an arbitrary object without prior training. However, these zero-shot methods have so far treated the environment as unknown for each consecutive query. In this paper we introduce a new benchmark for zero-shot multi-object navigation, allowing the robot to leverage information gathered from previous searches to more efficiently find new objects. To address this problem we build a reusable open-vocabulary feature map tailored for real-time object search. We further propose a probabilistic-semantic map update that mitigates common sources of errors in semantic feature extraction and leverage this semantic uncertainty for informed multi-object exploration. We evaluate our method on a set of object navigation tasks in both simulation as well as with a real robot, running in real-time on a Jetson Orin AGX. We demonstrate that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches both on single and multi-object navigation tasks. Additional videos, code and the multi-object navigation benchmark will be available on https://finnbsch.github.io/OneMap.</description>

      <title>Generating Visual Stories with Grounded and Coreferent Characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characters are important in narratives. They move the plot forward, create emotional connections, and embody the story's themes. Visual storytelling methods focus more on the plot and events relating to it, without building the narrative around specific characters. As a result, the generated stories feel generic, with character mentions being absent, vague, or incorrect. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the new task of character-centric story generation and present the first model capable of predicting visual stories with consistently grounded and coreferent character mentions. Our model is finetuned on a new dataset which we build on top of the widely used VIST benchmark. Specifically, we develop an automated pipeline to enrich VIST with visual and textual character coreference chains. We also propose new evaluation metrics to measure the richness of characters and coreference in stories. Experimental results show that our model generates stories with recurring characters which are consistent and coreferent to larger extent compared to baselines and state-of-the-art systems.</description>

      <title>OATS: Outlier-Aware Pruning Through Sparse and Low Rank Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent paradigm shift to large-scale foundation models has brought about a new era for deep learning that, while has found great success in practice, has also been plagued by prohibitively expensive costs in terms of high memory consumption and compute. To mitigate these issues, there has been a concerted effort in post-hoc neural network pruning techniques that do not require costly retraining. Despite the considerable progress being made, existing methods often exhibit a steady drop in model performance as the compression increases. In this paper, we present a novel approach to compressing large transformers, coined OATS, that utilizes the second moment information in the input embeddings to decompose the model weights into a sum of sparse and low-rank matrices. Without any retraining, OATS achieves state-of-the-art performance when compressing models by up to $60\%$ on large language models such as Llama-3 and Phi-3 and vision transformers such as ViT and DINOv2 while delivering up to $1.37\times$ the CPU acceleration versus a model that was comparably pruned.</description>

      <title>PAPILLON: Efficient and Stealthy Fuzz Testing-Powered Jailbreaks for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14866v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in various tasks but are still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where attackers create jailbreak prompts to mislead the model to produce harmful or offensive content. Current jailbreak methods either rely heavily on manually crafted templates, which pose challenges in scalability and adaptability, or struggle to generate semantically coherent prompts, making them easy to detect. Additionally, most existing approaches involve lengthy prompts, leading to higher query costs. In this paper, to remedy these challenges, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack framework called PAPILLON, which is an automated, black-box jailbreaking attack framework that adapts the black-box fuzz testing approach with a series of customized designs. Instead of relying on manually crafted templates,PAPILLON starts with an empty seed pool, removing the need to search for any related jailbreaking templates. We also develop three novel question-dependent mutation strategies using an LLM helper to generate prompts that maintain semantic coherence while significantly reducing their length. Additionally, we implement a two-level judge module to accurately detect genuine successful jailbreaks. We evaluated PAPILLON on 7 representative LLMs and compared it with 5 state-of-the-art jailbreaking attack strategies. For proprietary LLM APIs, such as GPT-3.5 turbo, GPT-4, and Gemini-Pro, PAPILLONs achieves attack success rates of over 90%, 80%, and 74%, respectively, exceeding existing baselines by more than 60\%. Additionally, PAPILLON can maintain high semantic coherence while significantly reducing the length of jailbreak prompts.

      <title>Tri-Clustering: A Multi-views Tri-level Information Fusion Context Clustering Framework for Localization and Classification in Mammography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Breast cancer is a significant global health issue, and the diagnosis of breast imaging has always been challenging. Mammography images typically have extremely high resolution, with lesions occupying only a very small area. Down-sampling in neural networks can easily lead to the loss of microcalcifications or subtle structures, making it difficult for traditional neural network architectures to address these issues. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Context Clustering Network with triple information fusion. Firstly, compared to CNNs or transformers, we find that Context clustering methods (1) are more computationally efficient and (2) can more easily associate structural or pathological features, making them suitable for the clinical tasks of mammography. Secondly, we propose a triple information fusion mechanism that integrates global information, feature-based local information, and patch-based local information. The proposed approach is rigorously evaluated on two public datasets, Vindr-Mammo and CBIS-DDSM, using five independent splits to ensure statistical robustness. Our method achieves an AUC of 0.828 on Vindr-Mammo and 0.805 on CBIS-DDSM, outperforming the next best method by 3.1% and 2.4%, respectively. These improvements are statistically significant (p&lt;0.05), underscoring the benefits of Context Clustering Network with triple information fusion. Overall, our Context Clustering framework demonstrates strong potential as a scalable and cost-effective solution for large-scale mammography screening, enabling more efficient and accurate breast cancer detection. Access to our method is available at https://github.com/Sohyu1/Mammo_Clustering.</description>

      <title>StarVid: Enhancing Semantic Alignment in Video Diffusion Models via Spatial and SynTactic Guided Attention Refocusing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation with diffusion models have garnered significant attention. However, they typically perform well in scenes with a single object and motion, struggling in compositional scenarios with multiple objects and distinct motions to accurately reflect the semantic content of text prompts. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{StarVid}, a plug-and-play, training-free method that improves semantic alignment between multiple subjects, their motions, and text prompts in T2V models. StarVid first leverages the spatial reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for two-stage motion trajectory planning based on text prompts. Such trajectories serve as spatial priors, guiding a spatial-aware loss to refocus cross-attention (CA) maps into distinctive regions. Furthermore, we propose a syntax-guided contrastive constraint to strengthen the correlation between the CA maps of verbs and their corresponding nouns, enhancing motion-subject binding. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms baseline methods, delivering videos of higher quality with improved semantic consistency.</description>

      <title>Minimal Variance Model Aggregation: A principled, non-intrusive, and versatile integration of black box models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether deterministic or stochastic, models can be viewed as functions designed to approximate a specific quantity of interest. We introduce Minimal Empirical Variance Aggregation (MEVA), a data-driven framework that integrates predictions from various models, enhancing overall accuracy by leveraging the individual strengths of each. This non-intrusive, model-agnostic approach treats the contributing models as black boxes and accommodates outputs from diverse methodologies, including machine learning algorithms and traditional numerical solvers. We advocate for a point-wise linear aggregation process and consider two methods for optimizing this aggregate: Minimal Error Aggregation (MEA), which minimizes the prediction error, and Minimal Variance Aggregation (MVA), which focuses on reducing variance. We prove a theorem showing that MVA can be more robustly estimated from data than MEA, making MEVA superior to Minimal Empirical Error Aggregation (MEEA). Unlike MEEA, which interpolates target values directly, MEVA formulates aggregation as an error estimation problem, which can be performed using any backbone learning paradigm. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our framework across various applications, including data science and partial differential equations, illustrating its ability to significantly enhance both robustness and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Scaling Offline Model-Based RL via Jointly-Optimized World-Action Model Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant aspiration of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is to develop a generalist agent with high capabilities from large and heterogeneous datasets. However, prior approaches that scale offline RL either rely heavily on expert trajectories or struggle to generalize to diverse unseen tasks. Inspired by the excellent generalization of world model in conditional video generation, we explore the potential of image observation-based world model for scaling offline RL and enhancing generalization on novel tasks. In this paper, we introduce JOWA: Jointly-Optimized World-Action model, an offline model-based RL agent pretrained on multiple Atari games with 6 billion tokens data to learn general-purpose representation and decision-making ability. Our method jointly optimizes a world-action model through a shared transformer backbone, which stabilize temporal difference learning with large models during pretraining. Moreover, we propose a provably efficient and parallelizable planning algorithm to compensate for the Q-value estimation error and thus search out better policies. Experimental results indicate that our largest agent, with 150 million parameters, achieves 78.9% human-level performance on pretrained games using only 10% subsampled offline data, outperforming existing state-of-the-art large-scale offline RL baselines by 31.6% on averange. Furthermore, JOWA scales favorably with model capacity and can sample-efficiently transfer to novel games using only 5k offline fine-tuning data (approximately 4 trajectories) per game, demonstrating superior generalization. We will release codes and model weights at https://github.com/CJReinforce/JOWA</description>

      <title>PhyMPGN: Physics-encoded Message Passing Graph Network for spatiotemporal PDE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) serves as a cornerstone for modeling complex dynamical systems. Recent progresses have demonstrated grand benefits of data-driven neural-based models for predicting spatiotemporal dynamics (e.g., tremendous speedup gain compared with classical numerical methods). However, most existing neural models rely on rich training data, have limited extrapolation and generalization abilities, and suffer to produce precise or reliable physical prediction under intricate conditions (e.g., irregular mesh or geometry, complex boundary conditions, diverse PDE parameters, etc.). To this end, we propose a new graph learning approach, namely, Physics-encoded Message Passing Graph Network (PhyMPGN), to model spatiotemporal PDE systems on irregular meshes given small training datasets. Specifically, we incorporate a GNN into a numerical integrator to approximate the temporal marching of spatiotemporal dynamics for a given PDE system. Considering that many physical phenomena are governed by diffusion processes, we further design a learnable Laplace block, which encodes the discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator, to aid and guide the GNN learning in a physically feasible solution space. A boundary condition padding strategy is also designed to improve the model convergence and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhyMPGN is capable of accurately predicting various types of spatiotemporal dynamics on coarse unstructured meshes, consistently achieves the state-of-the-art results, and outperforms other baselines with considerable gains.</description>

      <title>The Labyrinth of Links: Navigating the Associative Maze of Multi-modal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive capability. However, recently many deficiencies of MLLMs have been found compared to human intelligence, $\textit{e.g.}$, hallucination. To drive the MLLMs study, the community dedicated efforts to building larger benchmarks with complex tasks. In this paper, we propose benchmarking an essential but usually overlooked intelligence: $\textbf{association}$, a human's basic capability to link observation and prior practice memory. To comprehensively investigate MLLM's performance on the association, we formulate the association task and devise a standard benchmark based on adjective and verb semantic concepts. Instead of costly data annotation and curation, we propose a convenient $\textbf{annotation-free}$ construction method transforming the general dataset for our association tasks. Simultaneously, we devise a rigorous data refinement process to eliminate confusion in the raw dataset. Building on this database, we establish three levels of association tasks: single-step, synchronous, and asynchronous associations. Moreover, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the MLLMs' zero-shot association capabilities, addressing multiple dimensions, including three distinct memory strategies, both open-source and closed-source MLLMs, cutting-edge Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, and the involvement of human experts. Our systematic investigation shows that current open-source MLLMs consistently exhibit poor capability in our association tasks, even the currently state-of-the-art GPT-4V(vision) also has a significant gap compared to humans. We believe our benchmark would pave the way for future MLLM studies. $\textit{Our data and code are available at:}$ https://mvig-rhos.com/llm_inception.</description>

      <title>Robust Weight Initialization for Tanh Neural Networks with Fixed Point Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a neural network's depth increases, it can improve generalization performance. However, training deep networks is challenging due to gradient and signal propagation issues. To address these challenges, extensive theoretical research and various methods have been introduced. Despite these advances, effective weight initialization methods for tanh neural networks remain insufficiently investigated. This paper presents a novel weight initialization method for neural networks with tanh activation function. Based on an analysis of the fixed points of the function $\tanh(ax)$, the proposed method aims to determine values of $a$ that mitigate activation saturation. A series of experiments on various classification datasets and physics-informed neural networks demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms Xavier initialization methods~(with or without normalization) in terms of robustness across different network sizes, data efficiency, and convergence speed.

      <title>Structural-Entropy-Based Sample Selection for Efficient and Effective Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sample selection improves the efficiency and effectiveness of machine learning models by providing informative and representative samples. Typically, samples can be modeled as a sample graph, where nodes are samples and edges represent their similarities. Most existing methods are based on local information, such as the training difficulty of samples, thereby overlooking global information, such as connectivity patterns. This oversight can result in suboptimal selection because global information is crucial for ensuring that the selected samples well represent the structural properties of the graph. To address this issue, we employ structural entropy to quantify global information and losslessly decompose it from the whole graph to individual nodes using the Shapley value. Based on the decomposition, we present $\textbf{S}$tructural-$\textbf{E}$ntropy-based sample $\textbf{S}$election ($\textbf{SES}$), a method that integrates both global and local information to select informative and representative samples. SES begins by constructing a $k$NN-graph among samples based on their similarities. It then measures sample importance by combining structural entropy (global metric) with training difficulty (local metric). Finally, SES applies importance-biased blue noise sampling to select a set of diverse and representative samples. Comprehensive experiments on three learning scenarios -- supervised learning, active learning, and continual learning -- clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>MetaMetrics: Calibrating Metrics For Generation Tasks Using Human Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02381v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the quality of a performance evaluation metric is crucial for ensuring that model outputs align with human preferences. However, it remains unclear how well each metric captures the diverse aspects of these preferences, as metrics often excel in one particular area but not across all dimensions. To address this, it is essential to systematically calibrate metrics to specific aspects of human preference, catering to the unique characteristics of each aspect. We introduce MetaMetrics, a calibrated meta-metric designed to evaluate generation tasks across different modalities in a supervised manner. MetaMetrics optimizes the combination of existing metrics to enhance their alignment with human preferences. Our metric demonstrates flexibility and effectiveness in both language and vision downstream tasks, showing significant benefits across various multilingual and multi-domain scenarios. MetaMetrics aligns closely with human preferences and is highly extendable and easily integrable into any application. This makes MetaMetrics a powerful tool for improving the evaluation of generation tasks, ensuring that metrics are more representative of human judgment across diverse contexts.</description>

      <title>DailyDilemmas: Revealing Value Preferences of LLMs with Quandaries of Daily Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As users increasingly seek guidance from LLMs for decision-making in daily life, many of these decisions are not clear-cut and depend significantly on the personal values and ethical standards of people. We present DailyDilemmas, a dataset of 1,360 moral dilemmas encountered in everyday life. Each dilemma presents two possible actions, along with affected parties and relevant human values for each action. Based on these dilemmas, we gather a repository of human values covering diverse everyday topics, such as interpersonal relationships, workplace, and environmental issues. With DailyDilemmas, we evaluate LLMs on these dilemmas to determine what action they will choose and the values represented by these action choices. Then, we analyze values through the lens of five theoretical frameworks inspired by sociology, psychology, and philosophy, including the World Values Survey, Moral Foundations Theory, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, Aristotle's Virtues, and Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions. For instance, we find LLMs are most aligned with self-expression over survival in World Values Survey and care over loyalty in Moral Foundations Theory. Interestingly, we find substantial preference differences in models for some core values. For example, for truthfulness, Mixtral-8x7B neglects it by 9.7% while GPT-4-turbo selects it by 9.4%. We also study the recent guidance released by OpenAI (ModelSpec), and Anthropic (Constitutional AI) to understand how their designated principles reflect their models' actual value prioritization when facing nuanced moral reasoning in daily-life settings. Finally, we find that end users cannot effectively steer such prioritization using system prompts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enables robots to learn complex behaviors through interaction with the environment. However, due to the unrestricted nature of the learning algorithms, the resulting solutions are often brittle and appear unnatural. This is especially true for learning direct joint-level torque control, as inductive biases are difficult to integrate into the learning process. We propose an inductive bias for learning locomotion that is especially useful for torque control: latent actions learned from a small dataset of expert demonstrations. This prior allows the policy to directly leverage knowledge contained in the expert's actions and facilitates more efficient exploration. We observe that the agent is not restricted to the reward levels of the demonstration, and performance in transfer tasks is improved significantly. Latent action priors combined with style rewards for imitation lead to a closer replication of the expert's behavior.

      <title>LANTERN: Accelerating Visual Autoregressive Models with Relaxed Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Auto-Regressive (AR) models have recently gained prominence in image generation, often matching or even surpassing the performance of diffusion models. However, one major limitation of AR models is their sequential nature, which processes tokens one at a time, slowing down generation compared to models like GANs or diffusion-based methods that operate more efficiently. While speculative decoding has proven effective for accelerating LLMs by generating multiple tokens in a single forward, its application in visual AR models remains largely unexplored. In this work, we identify a challenge in this setting, which we term \textit{token selection ambiguity}, wherein visual AR models frequently assign uniformly low probabilities to tokens, hampering the performance of speculative decoding. To overcome this challenge, we propose a relaxed acceptance condition referred to as LANTERN that leverages the interchangeability of tokens in latent space. This relaxation restores the effectiveness of speculative decoding in visual AR models by enabling more flexible use of candidate tokens that would otherwise be prematurely rejected. Furthermore, by incorporating a total variation distance bound, we ensure that these speed gains are achieved without significantly compromising image quality or semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method in providing a substantial speed-up over speculative decoding. In specific, compared to a na\"ive application of the state-of-the-art speculative decoding, LANTERN increases speed-ups by $\mathbf{1.75}\times$ and $\mathbf{1.82}\times$, as compared to greedy decoding and random sampling, respectively, when applied to LlamaGen, a contemporary visual AR model. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/jadohu/LANTERN.</description>

      <title>Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03463v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have been effective in learning data priors for solving inverse problems. They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems. Our code is available at https://github.com/neuraloperator/DiffStateGrad.</description>

      <title>Decoding Game: On Minimax Optimality of Heuristic Text Generation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoding strategies play a pivotal role in text generation for modern language models, yet a puzzling gap divides theory and practice. Surprisingly, strategies that should intuitively be optimal, such as Maximum a Posteriori (MAP), often perform poorly in practice. Meanwhile, popular heuristic approaches like Top-$k$ and Nucleus sampling, which employ truncation and normalization of the conditional next-token probabilities, have achieved great empirical success but lack theoretical justifications. In this paper, we propose Decoding Game, a comprehensive theoretical framework which reimagines text generation as a two-player zero-sum game between Strategist, who seeks to produce text credible in the true distribution, and Nature, who distorts the true distribution adversarially. After discussing the decomposibility of multi-step generation, we derive the optimal strategy in closed form for one-step Decoding Game. It is shown that the adversarial Nature imposes an implicit regularization on likelihood maximization, and truncation-normalization methods are first-order approximations to the optimal strategy under this regularization. Additionally, by generalizing the objective and parameters of Decoding Game, near-optimal strategies encompass diverse methods such as greedy search, temperature scaling, and hybrids thereof. Numerical experiments are conducted to complement our theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Image Watermarks are Removable Using Controllable Regeneration from Clean Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image watermark techniques provide an effective way to assert ownership, deter misuse, and trace content sources, which has become increasingly essential in the era of large generative models. A critical attribute of watermark techniques is their robustness against various manipulations. In this paper, we introduce a watermark removal approach capable of effectively nullifying state-of-the-art watermarking techniques. Our primary insight involves regenerating the watermarked image starting from a clean Gaussian noise via a controllable diffusion model, utilizing the extracted semantic and spatial features from the watermarked image. The semantic control adapter and the spatial control network are specifically trained to control the denoising process towards ensuring image quality and enhancing consistency between the cleaned image and the original watermarked image. To achieve a smooth trade-off between watermark removal performance and image consistency, we further propose an adjustable and controllable regeneration scheme. This scheme adds varying numbers of noise steps to the latent representation of the watermarked image, followed by a controlled denoising process starting from this noisy latent representation. As the number of noise steps increases, the latent representation progressively approaches clean Gaussian noise, facilitating the desired trade-off. We apply our watermark removal methods across various watermarking techniques, and the results demonstrate that our methods offer superior visual consistency/quality and enhanced watermark removal performance compared to existing regeneration approaches.

      <title>ViBiDSampler: Enhancing Video Interpolation Using Bidirectional Diffusion Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation, especially in terms of keyframe interpolation. However, current image-to-video diffusion models, while powerful in generating videos from a single conditioning frame, need adaptation for two-frame (start &amp; end) conditioned generation, which is essential for effective bounded interpolation. Unfortunately, existing approaches that fuse temporally forward and backward paths in parallel often suffer from off-manifold issues, leading to artifacts or requiring multiple iterative re-noising steps. In this work, we introduce a novel, bidirectional sampling strategy to address these off-manifold issues without requiring extensive re-noising or fine-tuning. Our method employs sequential sampling along both forward and backward paths, conditioned on the start and end frames, respectively, ensuring more coherent and on-manifold generation of intermediate frames. Additionally, we incorporate advanced guidance techniques, CFG++ and DDS, to further enhance the interpolation process. By integrating these, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, efficiently generating high-quality, smooth videos between keyframes. On a single 3090 GPU, our method can interpolate 25 frames at 1024 x 576 resolution in just 195 seconds, establishing it as a leading solution for keyframe interpolation.</description>

      <title>From Tokens to Words: On the Inner Lexicon of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05864v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural language is composed of words, but modern large language models (LLMs) process sub-words as input. A natural question raised by this discrepancy is whether LLMs encode words internally, and if so how. We present evidence that LLMs engage in an intrinsic detokenization process, where sub-word sequences are combined into coherent whole-word representations at their last token. Our experiments show that this process primarily takes place within the early and middle layers of the model. We further demonstrate its robustness to arbitrary splits (e.g., "cats" to "ca" and "ts"), typos, and importantly-to out-of-vocabulary words: when feeding the last token internal representations of such words to the model as input, it can "understand" them as the complete word despite never seeing such representations as input during training. Our findings suggest that LLMs maintain a latent vocabulary beyond the tokenizer's scope. These insights provide a practical, finetuning-free application for expanding the vocabulary of pre-trained models. By enabling the addition of new vocabulary words, we reduce input length and inference iterations, which reduces both space and model latency, with little to no loss in model accuracy.</description>

      <title>Range, not Independence, Drives Modularity in Biologically Inspired Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06232v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Why do biological and artificial neurons sometimes modularise, each encoding a single meaningful variable, and sometimes entangle their representation of many variables? In this work, we develop a theory of when biologically inspired networks -- those that are nonnegative and energy efficient -- modularise their representation of source variables (sources). We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on a sample of sources that determine whether the neurons in an optimal biologically-inspired linear autoencoder modularise. Our theory applies to any dataset, extending far beyond the case of statistical independence studied in previous work. Rather we show that sources modularise if their support is ``sufficiently spread''. From this theory, we extract and validate predictions in a variety of empirical studies on how data distribution affects modularisation in nonlinear feedforward and recurrent neural networks trained on supervised and unsupervised tasks. Furthermore, we apply these ideas to neuroscience data, showing that range independence can be used to understand the mixing or modularising of spatial and reward information in entorhinal recordings in seemingly conflicting experiments. Further, we use these results to suggest alternate origins of mixed-selectivity, beyond the predominant theory of flexible nonlinear classification. In sum, our theory prescribes precise conditions on when neural activities modularise, providing tools for inducing and elucidating modular representations in brains and machines.</description>

      <title>Pair-VPR: Place-Aware Pre-training and Contrastive Pair Classification for Visual Place Recognition with Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose a novel joint training method for Visual Place Recognition (VPR), which simultaneously learns a global descriptor and a pair classifier for re-ranking. The pair classifier can predict whether a given pair of images are from the same place or not. The network only comprises Vision Transformer components for both the encoder and the pair classifier, and both components are trained using their respective class tokens. In existing VPR methods, typically the network is initialized using pre-trained weights from a generic image dataset such as ImageNet. In this work we propose an alternative pre-training strategy, by using Siamese Masked Image Modelling as a pre-training task. We propose a Place-aware image sampling procedure from a collection of large VPR datasets for pre-training our model, to learn visual features tuned specifically for VPR. By re-using the Mask Image Modelling encoder and decoder weights in the second stage of training, Pair-VPR can achieve state-of-the-art VPR performance across five benchmark datasets with a ViT-B encoder, along with further improvements in localization recall with larger encoders.

      <title>Subtle Errors Matter: Preference Learning via Error-injected Self-editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited strong mathematical reasoning prowess, tackling tasks ranging from basic arithmetic to advanced competition-level problems. However, frequently occurring subtle yet critical errors, such as miscalculations or incorrect substitutions, limit the LLMs' full potential. Existing studies to improve mathematical ability typically involve applying preference learning to step-wise solution pairs. Although these methods leverage samples of varying granularity to mitigate reasoning errors, they overlook critical subtle errors. In this work, we propose a novel preference learning framework called eRror-Injected Self-Editing (RISE), which injects predefined subtle errors into pivotal tokens in reasoning or computation steps to construct hard pairs for error mitigation. In detail, RISE uses the LLM itself to edit a small number of tokens in the solution, injecting designed subtle errors. Then, pairs composed of self-edited solutions and their corresponding correct ones, along with pairs of correct and incorrect solutions obtained through sampling, are used together for subtle error-aware DPO training. Compared with other preference learning methods, RISE further refines the training objective without requiring fine-grained sampling or preference annotation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RISE, with preference learning on Qwen2-7B-Instruct yielding notable improvements of 3.0% on GSM8K and 7.9% on MATH with only 4.5K training samples. Moreover, the effect of error mitigation extends from mathematical reasoning to logical reasoning and code generation.</description>

      <title>Compositional Entailment Learning for Hyperbolic Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image-text representation learning forms a cornerstone in vision-language models, where pairs of images and textual descriptions are contrastively aligned in a shared embedding space. Since visual and textual concepts are naturally hierarchical, recent work has shown that hyperbolic space can serve as a high-potential manifold to learn vision-language representation with strong downstream performance. In this work, for the first time we show how to fully leverage the innate hierarchical nature of hyperbolic embeddings by looking beyond individual image-text pairs. We propose Compositional Entailment Learning for hyperbolic vision-language models. The idea is that an image is not only described by a sentence but is itself a composition of multiple object boxes, each with their own textual description. Such information can be obtained freely by extracting nouns from sentences and using openly available localized grounding models. We show how to hierarchically organize images, image boxes, and their textual descriptions through contrastive and entailment-based objectives. Empirical evaluation on a hyperbolic vision-language model trained with millions of image-text pairs shows that the proposed compositional learning approach outperforms conventional Euclidean CLIP learning, as well as recent hyperbolic alternatives, with better zero-shot and retrieval generalization and clearly stronger hierarchical performance.</description>

      <title>MOOSE-Chem: Large Language Models for Rediscovering Unseen Chemistry Scientific Hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07076v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific discovery contributes largely to human society's prosperity, and recent progress shows that LLMs could potentially catalyze this process. However, it is still unclear whether LLMs can discover novel and valid hypotheses in chemistry. In this work, we investigate this central research question: Can LLMs automatically discover novel and valid chemistry research hypotheses given only a chemistry research background (consisting of a research question and/or a background survey), without limitation on the domain of the research question? After extensive discussions with chemistry experts, we propose an assumption that a majority of chemistry hypotheses can be resulted from a research background and several inspirations. With this key insight, we break the central question into three smaller fundamental questions. In brief, they are: (1) given a background question, whether LLMs can retrieve good inspirations; (2) with background and inspirations, whether LLMs can lead to hypothesis; and (3) whether LLMs can identify good hypotheses to rank them higher. To investigate these questions, we construct a benchmark consisting of 51 chemistry papers published in Nature, Science, or a similar level in 2024 (all papers are only available online since 2024). Every paper is divided by chemistry PhD students into three components: background, inspirations, and hypothesis. The goal is to rediscover the hypothesis, given only the background and a large randomly selected chemistry literature corpus consisting the ground truth inspiration papers, with LLMs trained with data up to 2023. We also develop an LLM-based multi-agent framework that leverages the assumption, consisting of three stages reflecting the three smaller questions. The proposed method can rediscover many hypotheses with very high similarity with the ground truth ones, covering the main innovations.</description>

      <title>Cheating Automatic LLM Benchmarks: Null Models Achieve High Win Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic LLM benchmarks, such as AlpacaEval 2.0, Arena-Hard-Auto, and MT-Bench, have become popular for evaluating language models due to their cost-effectiveness and scalability compared to human evaluation. Achieving high win rates on these benchmarks can significantly boost the promotional impact of newly released language models. This promotional benefit may motivate tricks, such as manipulating model output length or style to game win rates, even though several mechanisms have been developed to control length and disentangle style to reduce gameability. Nonetheless, we show that even a "null model" that always outputs a constant response (irrelevant to input instructions) can cheat automatic benchmarks and achieve top-ranked win rates: an 86.5% LC win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0; an 83.0 score on Arena-Hard-Auto; and a 9.55 score on MT-Bench. Moreover, the crafted cheating outputs are transferable because we assume that the instructions of these benchmarks (e.g., 805 samples of AlpacaEval 2.0) are private and cannot be accessed. While our experiments are primarily proof-of-concept, an adversary could use LLMs to generate more imperceptible cheating responses, unethically benefiting from high win rates and promotional impact. Our findings call for the development of anti-cheating mechanisms for reliable automatic benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Cheating-LLM-Benchmarks.</description>

      <title>MACPO: Weak-to-Strong Alignment via Multi-Agent Contrastive Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing and achieving near-human capabilities on specific tasks, aligning them with human values is becoming more urgent. In scenarios where LLMs outperform humans, we face a weak-to-strong alignment problem where we need to effectively align strong student LLMs through weak supervision generated by weak teachers. Existing alignment methods mainly focus on strong-to-weak alignment and self-alignment settings, and it is impractical to adapt them to the much harder weak-to-strong alignment setting. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-agent contrastive preference optimization (MACPO) framework. MACPO facilitates weak teachers and strong students to learn from each other by iteratively reinforcing unfamiliar positive behaviors while penalizing familiar negative ones. To get this, we devise a mutual positive behavior augmentation strategy to encourage weak teachers and strong students to learn from each other's positive behavior and further provide higher quality positive behavior for the next iteration. Additionally, we propose a hard negative behavior construction strategy to induce weak teachers and strong students to generate familiar negative behavior by fine-tuning on negative behavioral data. Experimental results on the HH-RLHF and PKU-SafeRLHF datasets, evaluated using both automatic metrics and human judgments, demonstrate that MACPO simultaneously improves the alignment performance of strong students and weak teachers. Moreover, as the number of weak teachers increases, MACPO achieves better weak-to-strong alignment performance through more iteration optimization rounds.</description>

      <title>RDT-1B: a Diffusion Foundation Model for Bimanual Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bimanual manipulation is essential in robotics, yet developing foundation models is extremely challenging due to the inherent complexity of coordinating two robot arms (leading to multi-modal action distributions) and the scarcity of training data. In this paper, we present the Robotics Diffusion Transformer (RDT), a pioneering diffusion foundation model for bimanual manipulation. RDT builds on diffusion models to effectively represent multi-modality, with innovative designs of a scalable Transformer to deal with the heterogeneity of multi-modal inputs and to capture the nonlinearity and high frequency of robotic data. To address data scarcity, we further introduce a Physically Interpretable Unified Action Space, which can unify the action representations of various robots while preserving the physical meanings of original actions, facilitating learning transferrable physical knowledge. With these designs, we managed to pre-train RDT on the largest collection of multi-robot datasets to date and scaled it up to 1.2B parameters, which is the largest diffusion-based foundation model for robotic manipulation. We finally fine-tuned RDT on a self-created multi-task bimanual dataset with over 6K+ episodes to refine its manipulation capabilities. Experiments on real robots demonstrate that RDT significantly outperforms existing methods. It exhibits zero-shot generalization to unseen objects and scenes, understands and follows language instructions, learns new skills with just 1~5 demonstrations, and effectively handles complex, dexterous tasks. We refer to https://rdt-robotics.github.io/rdt-robotics/ for the code and videos.</description>

      <title>A Closer Look at Machine Unlearning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) may memorize sensitive or copyrighted content, raising privacy and legal concerns. Due to the high cost of retraining from scratch, researchers attempt to employ machine unlearning to remove specific content from LLMs while preserving the overall performance. In this paper, we discuss several issues in machine unlearning for LLMs and provide our insights on possible approaches. To address the issue of inadequate evaluation of model outputs after unlearning, we introduce three additional metrics to evaluate token diversity, sentence semantics, and factual correctness. We then categorize unlearning methods into untargeted and targeted, and discuss their issues respectively. Specifically, the behavior that untargeted unlearning attempts to approximate is unpredictable and may involve hallucinations, and existing regularization is insufficient for targeted unlearning. To alleviate these issues, we propose using the objective of maximizing entropy (ME) for untargeted unlearning and incorporate answer preservation (AP) loss as regularization for targeted unlearning.

      <title>SPA: 3D Spatial-Awareness Enables Effective Embodied Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SPA, a novel representation learning framework that emphasizes the importance of 3D spatial awareness in embodied AI. Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning. Our strongest model takes more than 6000 GPU hours to train and we are committed to open-sourcing all code and model weights to foster future research in embodied representation learning.

      <title>Federated Learning in Practice: Reflections and Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning technique that enables multiple entities to collaboratively learn a shared model without exchanging their local data. Over the past decade, FL systems have achieved substantial progress, scaling to millions of devices across various learning domains while offering meaningful differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Production systems from organizations like Google, Apple, and Meta demonstrate the real-world applicability of FL. However, key challenges remain, including verifying server-side DP guarantees and coordinating training across heterogeneous devices, limiting broader adoption. Additionally, emerging trends such as large (multi-modal) models and blurred lines between training, inference, and personalization challenge traditional FL frameworks. In response, we propose a redefined FL framework that prioritizes privacy principles rather than rigid definitions. We also chart a path forward by leveraging trusted execution environments and open-source ecosystems to address these challenges and facilitate future advancements in FL.</description>

      <title>Utilizing ChatGPT in a Data Structures and Algorithms Course: A Teaching Assistant's Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT into computer science education offers transformative potential for complex courses such as data structures and algorithms (DSA). This study examines ChatGPT as a supplementary tool for teaching assistants (TAs), guided by structured prompts and human oversight, to enhance instruction and student outcomes. A controlled experiment compared traditional TA-led instruction with a hybrid approach where TAs used ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT o1 to generate exercises, clarify concepts, and provide feedback. Structured prompts emphasized problem decomposition, real-world context, and code examples, enabling tailored support while mitigating over-reliance on AI. Results demonstrated the hybrid approach's efficacy, with students in the ChatGPT-assisted group scoring 16.50 points higher on average and excelling in advanced topics. However, ChatGPT's limitations necessitated TA verification. This framework highlights the dual role of LLMs: augmenting TA efficiency while ensuring accuracy through human oversight, offering a scalable solution for human-AI collaboration in education.</description>

      <title>Instructional Segment Embedding: Improving LLM Safety with Instruction Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to security and safety threats, such as prompt injection, prompt extraction, and harmful requests. One major cause of these vulnerabilities is the lack of an instruction hierarchy. Modern LLM architectures treat all inputs equally, failing to distinguish between and prioritize various types of instructions, such as system messages, user prompts, and data. As a result, lower-priority user prompts may override more critical system instructions, including safety protocols. Existing approaches to achieving instruction hierarchy, such as delimiters and instruction-based training, do not address this issue at the architectural level. We introduce the Instructional Segment Embedding (ISE) technique, inspired by BERT, to modern large language models, which embeds instruction priority information directly into the model. This approach enables models to explicitly differentiate and prioritize various instruction types, significantly improving safety against malicious prompts that attempt to override priority rules. Our experiments on the Structured Query and Instruction Hierarchy benchmarks demonstrate an average robust accuracy increase of up to 15.75% and 18.68%, respectively. Furthermore, we observe an improvement in instruction-following capability of up to 4.1% evaluated on AlpacaEval. Overall, our approach offers a promising direction for enhancing the safety and effectiveness of LLM architectures.</description>

      <title>VisRAG: Vision-based Retrieval-augmented Generation on Multi-modality Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an effective technique that enables large language models (LLMs) to utilize external knowledge sources for generation. However, current RAG systems are solely based on text, rendering it impossible to utilize vision information like layout and images that play crucial roles in real-world multi-modality documents. In this paper, we introduce VisRAG, which tackles this issue by establishing a vision-language model (VLM)-based RAG pipeline. In this pipeline, instead of first parsing the document to obtain text, the document is directly embedded using a VLM as an image and then retrieved to enhance the generation of a VLM. Compared to traditional text-based RAG, VisRAG maximizes the retention and utilization of the data information in the original documents, eliminating the information loss introduced during the parsing process. We collect both open-source and synthetic data to train the retriever in VisRAG and explore a variety of generation methods. Experiments demonstrate that VisRAG outperforms traditional RAG in both the retrieval and generation stages, achieving a 20--40% end-to-end performance gain over traditional text-based RAG pipeline. Further analysis reveals that VisRAG is efficient in utilizing training data and demonstrates strong generalization capability, positioning it as a promising solution for RAG on multi-modality documents.

      <title>When Attention Sink Emerges in Language Models: An Empirical View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language Models (LMs) assign significant attention to the first token, even if it is not semantically important, which is known as attention sink. This phenomenon has been widely adopted in applications such as streaming/long context generation, KV cache optimization, inference acceleration, model quantization, and others. Despite its widespread use, a deep understanding of attention sink in LMs is still lacking. In this work, we first demonstrate that attention sinks exist universally in LMs with various inputs, even in small models. Furthermore, attention sink is observed to emerge during the LM pre-training, motivating us to investigate how optimization, data distribution, loss function, and model architecture in LM pre-training influence its emergence. We highlight that attention sink emerges after effective optimization on sufficient training data. The sink position is highly correlated with the loss function and data distribution. Most importantly, we find that attention sink acts more like key biases, storing extra attention scores, which could be non-informative and not contribute to the value computation. We also observe that this phenomenon (at least partially) stems from tokens' inner dependence on attention scores as a result of softmax normalization. After relaxing such dependence by replacing softmax attention with other attention operations, such as sigmoid attention without normalization, attention sinks do not emerge in LMs up to 1B parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Attention-Sink.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11112v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Differentiable Weightless Neural Network (DWN), a model based on interconnected lookup tables. Training of DWNs is enabled by a novel Extended Finite Difference technique for approximate differentiation of binary values. We propose Learnable Mapping, Learnable Reduction, and Spectral Regularization to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of these models. We evaluate DWNs in three edge computing contexts: (1) an FPGA-based hardware accelerator, where they demonstrate superior latency, throughput, energy efficiency, and model area compared to state-of-the-art solutions, (2) a low-power microcontroller, where they achieve preferable accuracy to XGBoost while subject to stringent memory constraints, and (3) ultra-low-cost chips, where they consistently outperform small models in both accuracy and projected hardware area. DWNs also compare favorably against leading approaches for tabular datasets, with higher average rank. Overall, our work positions DWNs as a pioneering solution for edge-compatible high-throughput neural networks.</description>

      <title>Bypassing the Exponential Dependency: Looped Transformers Efficiently Learn In-context by Multi-step Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context learning has been recognized as a key factor in the success of Large Language Models (LLMs). It refers to the model's ability to learn patterns on the fly from provided in-context examples in the prompt during inference. Previous studies have demonstrated that the Transformer architecture used in LLMs can implement a single-step gradient descent update by processing in-context examples in a single forward pass. Recent work has further shown that, during in-context learning, a looped Transformer can implement multi-step gradient descent updates in forward passes. However, their theoretical results require an exponential number of in-context examples, $n = \exp(\Omega(T))$, where $T$ is the number of loops or passes, to achieve a reasonably low error. In this paper, we study linear looped Transformers in-context learning on linear vector generation tasks. We show that linear looped Transformers can implement multi-step gradient descent efficiently for in-context learning. Our results demonstrate that as long as the input data has a constant condition number, e.g., $n = O(d)$, the linear looped Transformers can achieve a small error by multi-step gradient descent during in-context learning. Furthermore, our preliminary experiments validate our theoretical analysis. Our findings reveal that the Transformer architecture possesses a stronger in-context learning capability than previously understood, offering new insights into the mechanisms behind LLMs and potentially guiding the better design of efficient inference algorithms for LLMs.</description>

      <title>Offline Model-Based Optimization by Learning to Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline model-based optimization (MBO) aims to identify a design that maximizes a black-box function using only a fixed, pre-collected dataset of designs and their corresponding scores. A common approach in offline MBO is to train a regression-based surrogate model by minimizing mean squared error (MSE) and then find the best design within this surrogate model by different optimizers (e.g., gradient ascent). However, a critical challenge is the risk of out-of-distribution errors, i.e., the surrogate model may typically overestimate the scores and mislead the optimizers into suboptimal regions. Prior works have attempted to address this issue in various ways, such as using regularization techniques and ensemble learning to enhance the robustness of the model, but it still remains. In this paper, we argue that regression models trained with MSE are not well-aligned with the primary goal of offline MBO, which is to select promising designs rather than to predict their scores precisely. Notably, if a surrogate model can maintain the order of candidate designs based on their relative score relationships, it can produce the best designs even without precise predictions. To validate it, we conduct experiments to compare the relationship between the quality of the final designs and MSE, finding that the correlation is really very weak. In contrast, a metric that measures order-maintaining quality shows a significantly stronger correlation. Based on this observation, we propose learning a ranking-based model that leverages learning to rank techniques to prioritize promising designs based on their relative scores. We show that the generalization error on ranking loss can be well bounded. Empirical results across diverse tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed ranking-based models than twenty existing methods.</description>

      <title>Data-adaptive Differentially Private Prompt Synthesis for In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on the contextual information embedded in examples/demonstrations to perform in-context learning (ICL). To mitigate the risk of LLMs potentially leaking private information contained in examples in the prompt, we introduce a novel data-adaptive differentially private algorithm called AdaDPSyn to generate synthetic examples from the private dataset and then use these synthetic examples to perform ICL. The objective of AdaDPSyn is to adaptively adjust the noise level in the data synthesis mechanism according to the inherent statistical properties of the data, thereby preserving high ICL accuracy while maintaining formal differential privacy guarantees. A key innovation in AdaDPSyn is the Precision-Focused Iterative Radius Reduction technique, which dynamically refines the aggregation radius - the scope of data grouping for noise addition - based on patterns observed in data clustering, thereby minimizing the amount of additive noise. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks and compare AdaDPSyn with DP few-shot generation algorithm (Tang et al., 2023). The experiments demonstrate that AdaDPSyn not only outperforms DP few-shot generation, but also maintains high accuracy levels close to those of non-private baselines, providing an effective solution for ICL with privacy protection.</description>

      <title>MobA: Multifaceted Memory-Enhanced Adaptive Planning for Efficient Mobile Task Automation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based agents face significant challenges in handling complex GUI (Graphical User Interface) interactions on devices. These challenges arise from the dynamic and structured nature of GUI environments, which integrate text, images, and spatial relationships, as well as the variability in action spaces across different pages and tasks. To address these limitations, we propose MobA, a novel MLLM-based mobile assistant system. MobA introduces an adaptive planning module that incorporates a reflection mechanism for error recovery and dynamically adjusts plans to align with the real environment contexts and action module's execution capacity. Additionally, a multifaceted memory module provides comprehensive memory support to enhance adaptability and efficiency. We also present MobBench, a dataset designed for complex mobile interactions. Experimental results on MobBench and AndroidArena demonstrate MobA's ability to handle dynamic GUI environments and perform complex mobile task.</description>

      <title>DiscoGraMS: Enhancing Movie Screen-Play Summarization using Movie Character-Aware Discourse Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Summarizing movie screenplays presents a unique set of challenges compared to standard document summarization. Screenplays are not only lengthy, but also feature a complex interplay of characters, dialogues, and scenes, with numerous direct and subtle relationships and contextual nuances that are difficult for machine learning models to accurately capture and comprehend. Recent attempts at screenplay summarization focus on fine-tuning transformer-based pre-trained models, but these models often fall short in capturing long-term dependencies and latent relationships, and frequently encounter the "lost in the middle" issue. To address these challenges, we introduce DiscoGraMS, a novel resource that represents movie scripts as a movie character-aware discourse graph (CaD Graph). This approach is well-suited for various downstream tasks, such as summarization, question-answering, and salience detection. The model aims to preserve all salient information, offering a more comprehensive and faithful representation of the screenplay's content. We further explore a baseline method that combines the CaD Graph with the corresponding movie script through a late fusion of graph and text modalities, and we present very initial promising results.</description>

      <title>DFlow: Diverse Dialogue Flow Simulation with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing language model-based dialogue agents requires effective data to train models that can follow specific task logic. However, most existing data simulation methods focus on increasing diversity in language, topics, or dialogue acts at the utterance level, largely neglecting a critical aspect of task logic diversity at the dialogue level. This paper proposes a novel data simulation method designed to enhance the diversity of synthetic dialogues by focusing on task execution logic. Our method uses LLMs to generate decision tree-structured task plans, which enables the derivation of diverse dialogue trajectories for a given task. Each trajectory, referred to as a "dialog flow", guides the generation of a multi-turn dialogue that follows a unique trajectory. We apply this method to generate a task-oriented dialogue dataset comprising 3,886 dialogue flows across 15 different domains. We validate the effectiveness of this dataset using the next action prediction task, where models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform strong baselines, including GPT-4. Upon acceptance of this paper, we plan to release the code and data publicly.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Potential of Vision-Language Pre-Training for 3D Zero-Shot Lesion Segmentation via Mask-Attribute Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in medical vision-language pre-training models have driven significant progress in zero-shot disease recognition. However, transferring image-level knowledge to pixel-level tasks, such as lesion segmentation in 3D CT scans, remains a critical challenge. Due to the complexity and variability of pathological visual characteristics, existing methods struggle to align fine-grained lesion features not encountered during training with disease-related textual representations. In this paper, we present Malenia, a novel multi-scale lesion-level mask-attribute alignment framework, specifically designed for 3D zero-shot lesion segmentation. Malenia improves the compatibility between mask representations and their associated elemental attributes, explicitly linking the visual features of unseen lesions with the extensible knowledge learned from previously seen ones. Furthermore, we design a Cross-Modal Knowledge Injection module to enhance both visual and textual features with mutually beneficial information, effectively guiding the generation of segmentation results. Comprehensive experiments across three datasets and 12 lesion categories validate the superior performance of Malenia.</description>

      <title>TimeMixer++: A General Time Series Pattern Machine for Universal Predictive Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series analysis plays a critical role in numerous applications, supporting tasks such as forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. In this work, we present the time series pattern machine (TSPM), a model designed to excel in a broad range of time series tasks through powerful representation and pattern extraction capabilities. Traditional time series models often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales in the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing various mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series patterns. Specifically, we introduce a general-purpose TSPM that processes multi-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2) time image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4) multi-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns. MRTI transforms multi-scale time series into multi-resolution time images, capturing patterns across both temporal and frequency domains. TID leverages dual-axis attention to extract seasonal and trend patterns, while MCM hierarchically aggregates these patterns across scales. MRM adaptively integrates all representations across resolutions. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 time series analytical tasks, consistently surpassing both general-purpose and task-specific models. Our work marks a promising step toward the next generation of TSPMs, paving the way for further advancements in time series analysis.</description>

      <title>Optimal Ground Station Selection for Low-Earth Orbiting Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a solution to the problem of optimal ground station selection for low-Earth orbiting (LEO) space missions that enables mission operators to precisely design their ground segment performance and costs. Space mission operators are increasingly turning to Ground-Station-as-a-Service (GSaaS) providers to supply the terrestrial communications segment to reduce costs and increase network size. However, this approach leads to a new challenge of selecting the optimal service providers and station locations for a given mission. We consider the problem of ground station selection as an optimization problem and present a general solution framework that allows mission designers to set their overall optimization objective and constrain key mission performance variables such as total data downlink, total mission cost, recurring operational cost, and maximum communications time-gap. We solve the problem using integer programming (IP). To address computational scaling challenges, we introduce a surrogate optimization approach where the optimal station selection is determined based on solving the problem over a reduced time domain. Two different IP formulations are evaluated using randomized selections of LEO satellites of varying constellation sizes. We consider the networks of the commercial GSaaS providers Atlas Space Operations, Amazon Web Services (AWS) Ground Station, Azure Orbital Ground Station, Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT), Leaf Space, and Viasat Real-Time Earth. We compare our results against standard operational practices of integrating with one or two primary ground station providers.</description>

      <title>Graph Transformers Dream of Electric Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show theoretically and empirically that the linear Transformer, when applied to graph data, can implement algorithms that solve canonical problems such as electric flow and eigenvector decomposition. The Transformer has access to information on the input graph only via the graph's incidence matrix. We present explicit weight configurations for implementing each algorithm, and we bound the constructed Transformers' errors by the errors of the underlying algorithms. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by experiments on synthetic data. Additionally, on a real-world molecular regression task, we observe that the linear Transformer is capable of learning a more effective positional encoding than the default one based on Laplacian eigenvectors. Our work is an initial step towards elucidating the inner-workings of the Transformer for graph data. Code is available at https://github.com/chengxiang/LinearGraphTransformer</description>

      <title>First-Person Fairness in Chatbots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating chatbot fairness is crucial given their rapid proliferation, yet typical chatbot tasks (e.g., resume writing, entertainment) diverge from the institutional decision-making tasks (e.g., resume screening) which have traditionally been central to discussion of algorithmic fairness. The open-ended nature and diverse use-cases of chatbots necessitate novel methods for bias assessment. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a scalable counterfactual approach to evaluate "first-person fairness," meaning fairness toward chatbot users based on demographic characteristics. Our method employs a Language Model as a Research Assistant (LMRA) to yield quantitative measures of harmful stereotypes and qualitative analyses of demographic differences in chatbot responses. We apply this approach to assess biases in six of our language models across millions of interactions, covering sixty-six tasks in nine domains and spanning two genders and four races. Independent human annotations corroborate the LMRA-generated bias evaluations. This study represents the first large-scale fairness evaluation based on real-world chat data. We highlight that post-training reinforcement learning techniques significantly mitigate these biases. This evaluation provides a practical methodology for ongoing bias monitoring and mitigation.</description>

      <title>Self-Normalized Resets for Plasticity in Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasticity Loss is an increasingly important phenomenon that refers to the empirical observation that as a neural network is continually trained on a sequence of changing tasks, its ability to adapt to a new task diminishes over time. We introduce Self-Normalized Resets (SNR), a simple adaptive algorithm that mitigates plasticity loss by resetting a neuron's weights when evidence suggests its firing rate has effectively dropped to zero. Across a battery of continual learning problems and network architectures, we demonstrate that SNR consistently attains superior performance compared to its competitor algorithms. We also demonstrate that SNR is robust to its sole hyperparameter, its rejection percentile threshold, while competitor algorithms show significant sensitivity. SNR's threshold-based reset mechanism is motivated by a simple hypothesis test that we derive. Seen through the lens of this hypothesis test, competing reset proposals yield suboptimal error rates in correctly detecting inactive neurons, potentially explaining our experimental observations. We also conduct a theoretical investigation of the optimization landscape for the problem of learning a single ReLU. We show that even when initialized adversarially, an idealized version of SNR learns the target ReLU, while regularization-based approaches can fail to learn.</description>

      <title>Dynamics as Prompts: In-Context Learning for Sim-to-Real System Identifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer remains a significant challenge in robotics due to the discrepancies between simulated and real-world dynamics. Traditional methods like Domain Randomization often fail to capture fine-grained dynamics, limiting their effectiveness for precise control tasks. In this work, we propose a novel approach that dynamically adjusts simulation environment parameters online using in-context learning. By leveraging past interaction histories as context, our method adapts the simulation environment dynamics to real-world dynamics without requiring gradient updates, resulting in faster and more accurate alignment between simulated and real-world performance. We validate our approach across two tasks: object scooping and table air hockey. In the sim-to-sim evaluations, our method significantly outperforms the baselines on environment parameter estimation by 80% and 42% in the object scooping and table air hockey setups, respectively. Furthermore, our method achieves at least 70% success rate in sim-to-real transfer on object scooping across three different objects. By incorporating historical interaction data, our approach delivers efficient and smooth system identification, advancing the deployment of robots in dynamic real-world scenarios. Demos are available on our project page: https://sim2real-capture.github.io/</description>

      <title>L3Ms -- Lagrange Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and alignment of large language models (LLMs) are key steps in providing a good user experience. However, the concept of an appropriate alignment is inherently application-dependent, and current methods often rely on heuristic choices to drive optimization. In this work, we formulate SFT and alignment as a constrained optimization problem: the LLM is fine-tuned on a task while being required to meet application-specific requirements, without resorting to heuristics. To solve this, we propose Lagrange Large Language Models (L3Ms), which employ logarithmic barriers to enforce the constraints. This approach allows for the customization of L3Ms across diverse applications while avoiding heuristic-driven processes. We experimentally demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of L3Ms in achieving tailored alignments for various applications.</description>

      <title>Error Bounds for Physics-Informed Neural Networks in Fokker-Planck PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations are commonly used to describe the evolution of stochastic processes. The state uncertainty of such processes is best represented by the probability density function (PDF), whose evolution is governed by the Fokker-Planck partial differential equation (FP-PDE). However, it is generally infeasible to solve the FP-PDE in closed form. In this work, we show that physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can be trained to approximate the solution PDF. Our main contribution is the analysis of PINN approximation error: we develop a theoretical framework to construct tight error bounds using PINNs. In addition, we derive a practical error bound that can be efficiently constructed with standard training methods. We discuss that this error-bound framework generalizes to approximate solutions of other linear PDEs. Empirical results on nonlinear, high-dimensional, and chaotic systems validate the correctness of our error bounds while demonstrating the scalability of PINNs and their significant computational speedup in obtaining accurate PDF solutions compared to the Monte Carlo approach.</description>

      <title>Kinetix: Investigating the Training of General Agents through Open-Ended Physics-Based Control Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large models trained with self-supervised learning on offline datasets have shown remarkable capabilities in text and image domains, achieving the same generalisation for agents that act in sequential decision problems remains an open challenge. In this work, we take a step towards this goal by procedurally generating tens of millions of 2D physics-based tasks and using these to train a general reinforcement learning (RL) agent for physical control. To this end, we introduce Kinetix: an open-ended space of physics-based RL environments that can represent tasks ranging from robotic locomotion and grasping to video games and classic RL environments, all within a unified framework. Kinetix makes use of our novel hardware-accelerated physics engine Jax2D that allows us to cheaply simulate billions of environment steps during training. Our trained agent exhibits strong physical reasoning capabilities in 2D space, being able to zero-shot solve unseen human-designed environments. Furthermore, fine-tuning this general agent on tasks of interest shows significantly stronger performance than training an RL agent *tabula rasa*. This includes solving some environments that standard RL training completely fails at. We believe this demonstrates the feasibility of large scale, mixed-quality pre-training for online RL and we hope that Kinetix will serve as a useful framework to investigate this further.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the quality of published medical research with ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the quality of published research is important for evaluations of departments, researchers, and job candidates. Citation-based indicators sometimes support these tasks, but do not work for new articles and have low or moderate accuracy. Previous research has shown that ChatGPT can estimate the quality of research articles, with its scores correlating positively with an expert scores proxy in all fields, and often more strongly than citation-based indicators, except for clinical medicine. ChatGPT scores may therefore replace citation-based indicators for some applications. This article investigates the clinical medicine anomaly with the largest dataset yet and a more detailed analysis. The results showed that ChatGPT 4o-mini scores for articles submitted to the UK's Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021 Unit of Assessment (UoA) 1 Clinical Medicine correlated positively (r=0.134, n=9872) with departmental mean REF scores, against a theoretical maximum correlation of r=0.226. ChatGPT 4o and 3.5 turbo also gave positive correlations. At the departmental level, mean ChatGPT scores correlated more strongly with departmental mean REF scores (r=0.395, n=31). For the 100 journals with the most articles in UoA 1, their mean ChatGPT score correlated strongly with their REF score (r=0.495) but negatively with their citation rate (r=-0.148). Journal and departmental anomalies in these results point to ChatGPT being ineffective at assessing the quality of research in prestigious medical journals or research directly affecting human health, or both. Nevertheless, the results give evidence of ChatGPT's ability to assess research quality overall for Clinical Medicine, where it might replace citation-based indicators for new research.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Reclustering Barrier in Centroid-based Deep Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates an important phenomenon in centroid-based deep clustering (DC) algorithms: Performance quickly saturates after a period of rapid early gains. Practitioners commonly address early saturation with periodic reclustering, which we demonstrate to be insufficient to address performance plateaus. We call this phenomenon the "reclustering barrier" and empirically show when the reclustering barrier occurs, what its underlying mechanisms are, and how it is possible to Break the Reclustering Barrier with our algorithm BRB. BRB avoids early over-commitment to initial clusterings and enables continuous adaptation to reinitialized clustering targets while remaining conceptually simple. Applying our algorithm to widely-used centroid-based DC algorithms, we show that (1) BRB consistently improves performance across a wide range of clustering benchmarks, (2) BRB enables training from scratch, and (3) BRB performs competitively against state-of-the-art DC algorithms when combined with a contrastive loss. We release our code and pre-trained models at https://github.com/Probabilistic-and-Interactive-ML/breaking-the-reclustering-barrier .</description>

      <title>Evaluating Creative Short Story Generation in Humans and Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Story-writing is a fundamental aspect of human imagination, relying heavily on creativity to produce narratives that are novel, effective, and surprising. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate high-quality stories, their creative story-writing capabilities remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of creativity in short story generation across 60 LLMs and 60 people using a five-sentence creative story-writing task. We use measures to automatically evaluate model- and human-generated stories across several dimensions of creativity, including novelty, surprise, diversity, and linguistic complexity. We also collect creativity ratings and Turing Test classifications from non-expert and expert human raters and LLMs. Automated metrics show that LLMs generate stylistically complex stories, but tend to fall short in terms of novelty, surprise and diversity when compared to average human writers. Expert ratings generally coincide with automated metrics. However, LLMs and non-experts rate LLM stories to be more creative than human-generated stories. We discuss why and how these differences in ratings occur, and their implications for both human and artificial creativity.</description>

      <title>TokenSelect: Efficient Long-Context Inference and Length Extrapolation for LLMs via Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven growing demand for processing extended context sequences in contemporary applications. However, this progress faces two major challenges: performance degradation due to sequence lengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the quadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues hinder the application of LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a training-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference. TokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity, using Query-Key dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at token-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism, TokenSelect selectively involves a few critical KV cache tokens in attention calculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we design the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query similarity and implemented efficient dot product kernel, significantly reducing the overhead. A comprehensive evaluation of TokenSelect demonstrates up to 23.84x speedup in attention computation and up to 2.28x acceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-context inference methods.</description>

Abstract: Understanding identifiability of latent content and style variables from unaligned multi-domain data is essential for tasks such as domain translation and data generation. Existing works on content-style identification were often developed under somewhat stringent conditions, e.g., that all latent components are mutually independent and that the dimensions of the content and style variables are known. We introduce a new analytical framework via cross-domain \textit{latent distribution matching} (LDM), which establishes content-style identifiability under substantially more relaxed conditions. Specifically, we show that restrictive assumptions such as component-wise independence of the latent variables can be removed. Most notably, we prove that prior knowledge of the content and style dimensions is not necessary for ensuring identifiability, if sparsity constraints are properly imposed onto the learned latent representations. Bypassing the knowledge of the exact latent dimension has been a longstanding aspiration in unsupervised representation learning -- our analysis is the first to underpin its theoretical and practical viability. On the implementation side, we recast the LDM formulation into a regularized multi-domain GAN loss with coupled latent variables. We show that the reformulation is equivalent to LDM under mild conditions -- yet requiring considerably less computational resource. Experiments corroborate with our theoretical claims.</description>

      <title>CUIfy the XR: An Open-Source Package to Embed LLM-powered Conversational Agents in XR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in computer graphics, machine learning, and sensor technologies enable numerous opportunities for extended reality (XR) setups for everyday life, from skills training to entertainment. With large corporations offering affordable consumer-grade head-mounted displays (HMDs), XR will likely become pervasive, and HMDs will develop as personal devices like smartphones and tablets. However, having intelligent spaces and naturalistic interactions in XR is as important as technological advances so that users grow their engagement in virtual and augmented spaces. To this end, large language model (LLM)--powered non-player characters (NPCs) with speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) models bring significant advantages over conventional or pre-scripted NPCs for facilitating more natural conversational user interfaces (CUIs) in XR. This paper provides the community with an open-source, customizable, extendable, and privacy-aware Unity package, CUIfy, that facilitates speech-based NPC-user interaction with widely used LLMs, STT, and TTS models. Our package also supports multiple LLM-powered NPCs per environment and minimizes latency between different computational models through streaming to achieve usable interactions between users and NPCs. We publish our source code in the following repository: https://gitlab.lrz.de/hctl/cuify</description>

      <title>Slowing Down Forgetting in Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common challenge in continual learning (CL) is catastrophic forgetting, where the performance on old tasks drops after new, additional tasks are learned. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called ReCL to slow down forgetting in CL. Our framework exploits an implicit bias of gradient-based neural networks due to which these converge to margin maximization points. Such convergence points allow us to reconstruct old data from previous tasks, which we then combine with the current training data. Our framework is flexible and can be applied on top of existing, state-of-the-art CL methods. We further demonstrate the performance gain from our framework across a large series of experiments, including two challenging CL scenarios (class incremental and domain incremental learning), different datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, TinyImagenet), and different network architectures. Across all experiments, we find large performance gains through ReCL. To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the first to address catastrophic forgetting by leveraging models in CL as their own memory buffers.</description>

      <title>Gumbel Counterfactual Generation From Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07180v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and manipulating the causal generation mechanisms in language models is essential for controlling their behavior. Previous work has primarily relied on techniques such as representation surgery -- e.g., model ablations or manipulation of linear subspaces tied to specific concepts -- to \emph{intervene} on these models. To understand the impact of interventions precisely, it is useful to examine \emph{counterfactuals} -- e.g., how a given sentence would have appeared had it been generated by the model following a specific intervention. We highlight that counterfactual reasoning is conceptually distinct from interventions, as articulated in Pearl's causal hierarchy. Based on this observation, we propose a framework for generating true string counterfactuals by reformulating language models as a structural equation model using the Gumbel-max trick, which we called Gumbel counterfactual generation. This reformulation allows us to model the joint distribution over original strings and their counterfactuals resulting from the same instantiation of the sampling noise. We develop an algorithm based on hindsight Gumbel sampling that allows us to infer the latent noise variables and generate counterfactuals of observed strings. Our experiments demonstrate that the approach produces meaningful counterfactuals while at the same time showing that commonly used intervention techniques have considerable undesired side effects.</description>

      <title>Controllable Context Sensitivity and the Knob Behind It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When making predictions, a language model must trade off how much it relies on its context vs. its prior knowledge. Choosing how sensitive the model is to its context is a fundamental functionality, as it enables the model to excel at tasks like retrieval-augmented generation and question-answering. In this paper, we search for a knob which controls this sensitivity, determining whether language models answer from the context or their prior knowledge. To guide this search, we design a task for controllable context sensitivity. In this task, we first feed the model a context (Paris is in England) and a question (Where is Paris?); we then instruct the model to either use its prior or contextual knowledge and evaluate whether it generates the correct answer for both intents (either France or England). When fine-tuned on this task, instruction-tuned versions of Llama-3.1, Mistral-v0.3, and Gemma-2 can solve it with high accuracy (85-95%). Analyzing these high-performing models, we narrow down which layers may be important to context sensitivity using a novel linear time algorithm. Then, in each model, we identify a 1-D subspace in a single layer that encodes whether the model follows context or prior knowledge. Interestingly, while we identify this subspace in a fine-tuned model, we find that the exact same subspace serves as an effective knob in not only that model but also non-fine-tuned instruct and base models of that model family. Finally, we show a strong correlation between a model's performance and how distinctly it separates context-agreeing from context-ignoring answers in this subspace. These results suggest a single subspace facilitates how the model chooses between context and prior knowledge, hinting at a simple fundamental mechanism that controls this behavior.</description>

      <title>Automatically Improving LLM-based Verilog Generation using EDA Tool Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditionally, digital hardware designs are written in the Verilog hardware description language (HDL) and debugged manually by engineers. This can be time-consuming and error-prone for complex designs. Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as a potential tool to help generate fully functioning HDL code, but most works have focused on generation in the single-shot capacity: i.e., run and evaluate, a process that does not leverage debugging and, as such, does not adequately reflect a realistic development process. In this work, we evaluate the ability of LLMs to leverage feedback from electronic design automation (EDA) tools to fix mistakes in their own generated Verilog. To accomplish this, we present an open-source, highly customizable framework, AutoChip, which combines conversational LLMs with the output from Verilog compilers and simulations to iteratively generate and repair Verilog. To determine the success of these LLMs we leverage the VerilogEval benchmark set. We evaluate four state-of-the-art conversational LLMs, focusing on readily accessible commercial models. EDA tool feedback proved to be consistently more effective than zero-shot prompting only with GPT-4o, the most computationally complex model we evaluated. In the best case, we observed a 5.8% increase in the number of successful designs with a 34.2% decrease in cost over the best zero-shot results. Mixing smaller models with this larger model at the end of the feedback iterations resulted in equally as much success as with GPT-4o using feedback, but incurred 41.9% lower cost (corresponding to an overall decrease in cost over zero-shot by 89.6%).</description>

      <title>Exploring Iterative Controllable Summarization with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in abstractive summarization tasks. However, their ability to precisely control summary attributes (e.g., length or topic) remains underexplored, limiting their adaptability to specific user preferences. In this paper, we systematically explore the controllability of LLMs. To this end, we revisit summary attribute measurements and introduce iterative evaluation metrics, failure rate and average iteration count to precisely evaluate controllability of LLMs, rather than merely assessing errors. Our findings show that LLMs struggle more with numerical attributes than with linguistic attributes. To address this challenge, we propose a guide-to-explain framework (GTE) for controllable summarization. Our GTE framework enables the model to identify misaligned attributes in the initial draft and guides it in self-explaining errors in the previous output. By allowing the model to reflect on its misalignment, GTE generates well-adjusted summaries that satisfy the desired attributes with robust effectiveness, requiring surprisingly fewer iterations than other iterative approaches.</description>

      <title>The Illusion of Empathy: How AI Chatbots Shape Conversation Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AI chatbots increasingly incorporate empathy, understanding user-centered perceptions of chatbot empathy and its impact on conversation quality remains essential yet under-explored. This study examines how chatbot identity and perceived empathy influence users' overall conversation experience. Analyzing 155 conversations from two datasets, we found that while GPT-based chatbots were rated significantly higher in conversational quality, they were consistently perceived as less empathetic than human conversational partners. Empathy ratings from GPT-4o annotations aligned with user ratings, reinforcing the perception of lower empathy in chatbots compared to humans. Our findings underscore the critical role of perceived empathy in shaping conversation quality, revealing that achieving high-quality human-AI interactions requires more than simply embedding empathetic language; it necessitates addressing the nuanced ways users interpret and experience empathy in conversations with chatbots.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Image Synthesis via Next-Token Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, autoregressive models have demonstrated remarkable performance in class-conditional image generation. However, the application of next-token prediction to high-resolution text-to-image generation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{D-JEPA$\cdot$T2I}, an autoregressive model based on continuous tokens that incorporates innovations in both architecture and training strategy to generate high-quality, photorealistic images at arbitrary resolutions, up to 4K. Architecturally, we adopt the denoising joint embedding predictive architecture (D-JEPA) while leveraging a multimodal visual transformer to effectively integrate textual and visual features. Additionally, we introduce flow matching loss alongside the proposed Visual Rotary Positional Embedding (VoPE) to enable continuous resolution learning. In terms of training strategy, we propose a data feedback mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sampling procedure based on statistical analysis and an online learning critic model. This encourages the model to move beyond its comfort zone, reducing redundant training on well-mastered scenarios and compelling it to address more challenging cases with suboptimal generation quality. For the first time, we achieve state-of-the-art high-resolution image synthesis via next-token prediction.</description>

      <title>Dist Loss: Enhancing Regression in Few-Shot Region through Distribution Distance Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imbalanced data distributions are prevalent in real-world scenarios, posing significant challenges in both imbalanced classification and imbalanced regression tasks. They often cause deep learning models to overfit in areas of high sample density (many-shot regions) while underperforming in areas of low sample density (few-shot regions). This characteristic restricts the utility of deep learning models in various sectors, notably healthcare, where areas with few-shot data hold greater clinical relevance. While recent studies have shown the benefits of incorporating distribution information in imbalanced classification tasks, such strategies are rarely explored in imbalanced regression. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a novel loss function, termed Dist Loss, designed to minimize the distribution distance between the model's predictions and the target labels in a differentiable manner, effectively integrating distribution information into model training. Dist Loss enables deep learning models to regularize their output distribution during training, effectively enhancing their focus on few-shot regions. We have conducted extensive experiments across three datasets spanning computer vision and healthcare: IMDB-WIKI-DIR, AgeDB-DIR, and ECG-Ka-DIR. The results demonstrate that Dist Loss effectively mitigates the negative impact of imbalanced data distribution on model performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in sparse data regions. Furthermore, Dist Loss is easy to integrate, complementing existing methods.</description>

      <title>UniGaussian: Driving Scene Reconstruction from Multiple Camera Models via Unified Gaussian Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban scene reconstruction is crucial for real-world autonomous driving simulators. Although existing methods have achieved photorealistic reconstruction, they mostly focus on pinhole cameras and neglect fisheye cameras. In fact, how to effectively simulate fisheye cameras in driving scene remains an unsolved problem. In this work, we propose UniGaussian, a novel approach that learns a unified 3D Gaussian representation from multiple camera models for urban scene reconstruction in autonomous driving. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a new differentiable rendering method that distorts 3D Gaussians using a series of affine transformations tailored to fisheye camera models. This addresses the compatibility issue of 3D Gaussian splatting with fisheye cameras, which is hindered by light ray distortion caused by lenses or mirrors. Besides, our method maintains real-time rendering while ensuring differentiability. Second, built on the differentiable rendering method, we design a new framework that learns a unified Gaussian representation from multiple camera models. By applying affine transformations to adapt different camera models and regularizing the shared Gaussians with supervision from different modalities, our framework learns a unified 3D Gaussian representation with input data from multiple sources and achieves holistic driving scene understanding. As a result, our approach models multiple sensors (pinhole and fisheye cameras) and modalities (depth, semantic, normal and LiDAR point clouds). Our experiments show that our method achieves superior rendering quality and fast rendering speed for driving scene simulation.</description>

      <title>AnyECG: Foundational Models for Multitask Cardiac Analysis in Real-World Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG), a non-invasive and affordable tool for cardiac monitoring, is highly sensitive in detecting acute heart attacks. However, due to the lengthy nature of ECG recordings, numerous machine learning methods have been developed for automated heart disease detection to reduce human workload. Despite these efforts, performance remains suboptimal. A key obstacle is the inherent complexity of ECG data, which includes heterogeneity (e.g., varying sampling rates), high levels of noise, demographic-related pattern shifts, and intricate rhythm-event associations. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces AnyECG, a foundational model designed to extract robust representations from any real-world ECG data. Specifically, a tailored ECG Tokenizer encodes each fixed-duration ECG fragment into a token and, guided by proxy tasks, converts noisy, continuous ECG features into discrete, compact, and clinically meaningful local rhythm codes. These codes encapsulate basic morphological, frequency, and demographic information (e.g., sex), effectively mitigating signal noise. We further pre-train the AnyECG to learn rhythmic pattern associations across ECG tokens, enabling the capture of cardiac event semantics. By being jointly pre-trained on diverse ECG data sources, AnyECG is capable of generalizing across a wide range of downstream tasks where ECG signals are recorded from various devices and scenarios. The experimental results show that AnyECG achieves an average performance improvement of 6% across four critical tasks-anomaly detection, arrhythmia classification, corrupted lead generation, and ultra-long ECG recognition. AnyECG learns common ECG rhythm from data and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in each of these tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a geometric framework to analyze memorization in diffusion models through the sharpness of the log probability density. We mathematically justify a previously proposed score-difference-based memorization metric by demonstrating its effectiveness in quantifying sharpness. Additionally, we propose a novel memorization metric that captures sharpness at the initial stage of image generation in latent diffusion models, offering early insights into potential memorization. Leveraging this metric, we develop a mitigation strategy that optimizes the initial noise of the generation process using a sharpness-aware regularization term.</description>

      <title>PIG: Physics-Informed Gaussians as Adaptive Parametric Mesh Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The numerical approximation of partial differential equations (PDEs) using neural networks has seen significant advancements through Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Despite their straightforward optimization framework and flexibility in implementing various PDEs, PINNs often suffer from limited accuracy due to the spectral bias of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), which struggle to effectively learn high-frequency and nonlinear components. Recently, parametric mesh representations in combination with neural networks have been investigated as a promising approach to eliminate the inductive bias of MLPs. However, they usually require high-resolution grids and a large number of collocation points to achieve high accuracy while avoiding overfitting. In addition, the fixed positions of the mesh parameters restrict their flexibility, making accurate approximation of complex PDEs challenging. To overcome these limitations, we propose Physics-Informed Gaussians (PIGs), which combine feature embeddings using Gaussian functions with a lightweight neural network. Our approach uses trainable parameters for the mean and variance of each Gaussian, allowing for dynamic adjustment of their positions and shapes during training. This adaptability enables our model to optimally approximate PDE solutions, unlike models with fixed parameter positions. Furthermore, the proposed approach maintains the same optimization framework used in PINNs, allowing us to benefit from their excellent properties.

      <title>Curse of Attention: A Kernel-Based Perspective for Why Transformers Fail to Generalize on Time Series Forecasting and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The application of transformer-based models on time series forecasting (TSF) tasks has long been popular to study. However, many of these works fail to beat the simple linear residual model, and the theoretical understanding of this issue is still limited. In this work, we propose the first theoretical explanation of the inefficiency of transformers on TSF tasks. We attribute the mechanism behind it to {\bf Asymmetric Learning} in training attention networks. When the sign of the previous step is inconsistent with the sign of the current step in the next-step-prediction time series, attention fails to learn the residual features. This makes it difficult to generalize on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, especially on the sign-inconsistent next-step-prediction data, with the same representation pattern, whereas a linear residual network could easily accomplish it. We hope our theoretical insights provide important necessary conditions for designing the expressive and efficient transformer-based architecture for practitioners.</description>

      <title>CBraMod: A Criss-Cross Brain Foundation Model for EEG Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07236v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique to measure and record brain electrical activity, widely used in various BCI and healthcare applications. Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/wjq-learning/CBraMod.</description>

      <title>GAMED: Knowledge Adaptive Multi-Experts Decoupling for Multimodal Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal fake news detection often involves modelling heterogeneous data sources, such as vision and language. Existing detection methods typically rely on fusion effectiveness and cross-modal consistency to model the content, complicating understanding how each modality affects prediction accuracy. Additionally, these methods are primarily based on static feature modelling, making it difficult to adapt to the dynamic changes and relationships between different data modalities. This paper develops a significantly novel approach, GAMED, for multimodal modelling, which focuses on generating distinctive and discriminative features through modal decoupling to enhance cross-modal synergies, thereby optimizing overall performance in the detection process. GAMED leverages multiple parallel expert networks to refine features and pre-embed semantic knowledge to improve the experts' ability in information selection and viewpoint sharing. Subsequently, the feature distribution of each modality is adaptively adjusted based on the respective experts' opinions. GAMED also introduces a novel classification technique to dynamically manage contributions from different modalities, while improving the explainability of decisions. Experimental results on the Fakeddit and Yang datasets demonstrate that GAMED performs better than recently developed state-of-the-art models.

      <title>IOHunter: Graph Foundation Model to Uncover Online Information Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms have become vital spaces for public discourse, serving as modern agor\`as where a wide range of voices influence societal narratives. However, their open nature also makes them vulnerable to exploitation by malicious actors, including state-sponsored entities, who can conduct information operations (IOs) to manipulate public opinion. The spread of misinformation, false news, and misleading claims threatens democratic processes and societal cohesion, making it crucial to develop methods for the timely detection of inauthentic activity to protect the integrity of online discourse. In this work, we introduce a methodology designed to identify users orchestrating information operations, a.k.a. IO drivers, across various influence campaigns. Our framework, named IOHunter, leverages the combined strengths of Language Models and Graph Neural Networks to improve generalization in supervised, scarcely-supervised, and cross-IO contexts. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple sets of IOs originating from six countries, significantly surpassing existing approaches. This research marks a step toward developing Graph Foundation Models specifically tailored for the task of IO detection on social media platforms.</description>

      <title>Long-Term EEG Partitioning for Seizure Onset Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models have recently shown great success in classifying epileptic patients using EEG recordings. Unfortunately, classification-based methods lack a sound mechanism to detect the onset of seizure events. In this work, we propose a two-stage framework, SODor, that explicitly models seizure onset through a novel task formulation of subsequence clustering. Given an EEG sequence, the framework first learns a set of second-level embeddings with label supervision. It then employs model-based clustering to explicitly capture long-term temporal dependencies in EEG sequences and identify meaningful subsequences. Epochs within a subsequence share a common cluster assignment (normal or seizure), with cluster or state transitions representing successful onset detections. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method can correct misclassifications, achieving 5\%-11\% classification improvements over other baselines and accurately detecting seizure onsets.</description>

      <title>Cross-Spectral Vision Transformer for Biometric Authentication using Forehead Subcutaneous Vein Pattern and Periocular Pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional biometric systems have encountered significant setbacks due to various unavoidable factors, for example, face recognition-based biometrics fails due to the wearing of face masks and fingerprints create hygiene concerns. This paper proposes a novel lightweight cross-spectral vision transformer (CS-ViT) for biometric authentication using forehead subcutaneous vein patterns and periocular patterns, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods, capable of performing well even with the face masks and without any physical touch. The proposed framework comprises a cross-spectral dual-channel architecture designed to handle two distinct biometric traits and to capture inter-dependencies in terms of relative spectral patterns. Each channel consists of a Phase-Only Correlation Cross-Spectral Attention (POC-CSA) that captures their individual as well as correlated patterns. The computation of cross-spectral attention using POC extracts the phase correlation in the spatial features. Therefore, it is robust against the resolution/intensity variations and illumination of the input images, assuming both biometric traits are from the same person. The lightweight model is suitable for edge device deployment. The performance of the proposed algorithm was rigorously evaluated using the Forehead Subcutaneous Vein Pattern and Periocular Biometric Pattern (FSVP-PBP) database. The results demonstrated the superiority of the algorithm over state-of-the-art methods, achieving a remarkable classification accuracy of 98.8% with the combined vein and periocular patterns.</description>

      <title>Disparate Model Performance and Stability in Machine Learning Clinical Support for Diabetes and Heart Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are vital for supporting clinical decision-making in biomedical informatics. However, their predictive performance can vary across demographic groups, often due to the underrepresentation of historically marginalized populations in training datasets. The investigation reveals widespread sex- and age-related inequities in chronic disease datasets and their derived ML models. Thus, a novel analytical framework is introduced, combining systematic arbitrariness with traditional metrics like accuracy and data complexity. The analysis of data from over 25,000 individuals with chronic diseases revealed mild sex-related disparities, favoring predictive accuracy for males, and significant age-related differences, with better accuracy for younger patients. Notably, older patients showed inconsistent predictive accuracy across seven datasets, linked to higher data complexity and lower model performance. This highlights that representativeness in training data alone does not guarantee equitable outcomes, and model arbitrariness must be addressed before deploying models in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>TradingAgents: Multi-Agents LLM Financial Trading Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20138v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in automated problem-solving using societies of agents powered by large language models (LLMs). In finance, efforts have largely focused on single-agent systems handling specific tasks or multi-agent frameworks independently gathering data. However, multi-agent systems' potential to replicate real-world trading firms' collaborative dynamics remains underexplored. TradingAgents proposes a novel stock trading framework inspired by trading firms, featuring LLM-powered agents in specialized roles such as fundamental analysts, sentiment analysts, technical analysts, and traders with varied risk profiles. The framework includes Bull and Bear researcher agents assessing market conditions, a risk management team monitoring exposure, and traders synthesizing insights from debates and historical data to make informed decisions. By simulating a dynamic, collaborative trading environment, this framework aims to improve trading performance. Detailed architecture and extensive experiments reveal its superiority over baseline models, with notable improvements in cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown, highlighting the potential of multi-agent LLM frameworks in financial trading. TradingAgents is available at https://github.com/PioneerFintech.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Uncertainty Modeling with Semantic Graph for Hallucination Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination with non-factual or unfaithful statements, which undermines the applications in real-world scenarios. Recent researches focus on uncertainty-based hallucination detection, which utilizes the output probability of LLMs for uncertainty calculation and does not rely on external knowledge or frequent sampling from LLMs. Whereas, most approaches merely consider the uncertainty of each independent token, while the intricate semantic relations among tokens and sentences are not well studied, which limits the detection of hallucination that spans over multiple tokens and sentences in the passage. In this paper, we propose a method to enhance uncertainty modeling with semantic graph for hallucination detection. Specifically, we first construct a semantic graph that well captures the relations among entity tokens and sentences. Then, we incorporate the relations between two entities for uncertainty propagation to enhance sentence-level hallucination detection. Given that hallucination occurs due to the conflict between sentences, we further present a graph-based uncertainty calibration method that integrates the contradiction probability of the sentence with its neighbors in the semantic graph for uncertainty calculation. Extensive experiments on two datasets show the great advantages of our proposed approach. In particular, we obtain substantial improvements with 19.78% in passage-level hallucination detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brain tumors can lead to neurological dysfunction, cognitive and psychological changes, increased intracranial pressure, and seizures, posing significant risks to health. The You Only Look Once (YOLO) series has shown superior accuracy in medical imaging object detection. This paper presents a novel SCC-YOLO architecture that integrates the SCConv module into YOLOv9. The SCConv module optimizes convolutional efficiency by reducing spatial and channel redundancy, enhancing image feature learning. We examine the effects of different attention mechanisms with YOLOv9 for brain tumor detection using the Br35H dataset and our custom dataset (Brain_Tumor_Dataset). Results indicate that SCC-YOLO improved mAP50 by 0.3% on the Br35H dataset and by 0.5% on our custom dataset compared to YOLOv9. SCC-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance in brain tumor detection.</description>

      <title>LLaVA-Mini: Efficient Image and Video Large Multimodal Models with One Vision Token</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of real-time large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4o has sparked considerable interest in efficient LMMs. LMM frameworks typically encode visual inputs into vision tokens (continuous representations) and integrate them and textual instructions into the context of large language models (LLMs), where large-scale parameters and numerous context tokens (predominantly vision tokens) result in substantial computational overhead. Previous efforts towards efficient LMMs always focus on replacing the LLM backbone with smaller models, while neglecting the crucial issue of token quantity. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Mini, an efficient LMM with minimal vision tokens. To achieve a high compression ratio of vision tokens while preserving visual information, we first analyze how LMMs understand vision tokens and find that most vision tokens only play a crucial role in the early layers of LLM backbone, where they mainly fuse visual information into text tokens. Building on this finding, LLaVA-Mini introduces modality pre-fusion to fuse visual information into text tokens in advance, thereby facilitating the extreme compression of vision tokens fed to LLM backbone into one token. LLaVA-Mini is a unified large multimodal model that can support the understanding of images, high-resolution images, and videos in an efficient manner. Experiments across 11 image-based and 7 video-based benchmarks demonstrate that LLaVA-Mini outperforms LLaVA-v1.5 with just 1 vision token instead of 576. Efficiency analyses reveal that LLaVA-Mini can reduce FLOPs by 77%, deliver low-latency responses within 40 milliseconds, and process over 10,000 frames of video on the GPU hardware with 24GB of memory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth in sensor data, effectively interpreting and interfacing with these data in a human-understandable way has become crucial. While existing research primarily focuses on learning classification models, fewer studies have explored how end users can actively extract useful insights from sensor data, often hindered by the lack of a proper dataset. To address this gap, we introduce SensorQA, the first human-created question-answering (QA) dataset for long-term time-series sensor data for daily life monitoring. SensorQA is created by human workers and includes 5.6K diverse and practical queries that reflect genuine human interests, paired with accurate answers derived from sensor data. We further establish benchmarks for state-of-the-art AI models on this dataset and evaluate their performance on typical edge devices. Our results reveal a gap between current models and optimal QA performance and efficiency, highlighting the need for new contributions. The dataset and code are available at: https://github.com/benjamin-reichman/SensorQA.</description>

      <title>Multiagent Finetuning: Self Improvement with Diverse Reasoning Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in recent years but are fundamentally limited by the underlying training data. To improve models beyond the training data, recent works have explored how LLMs can be used to generate synthetic data for autonomous self-improvement. However, successive steps of self-improvement can reach a point of diminishing returns. In this work, we propose a complementary approach towards self-improvement where finetuning is applied to a multiagent society of language models. A group of language models, all starting from the same base model, are independently specialized by updating each one using data generated through multiagent interactions among the models. By training each model on independent sets of data, we illustrate how this approach enables specialization across models and diversification over the set of models. As a result, our overall system is able to preserve diverse reasoning chains and autonomously improve over many more rounds of fine-tuning than single-agent self-improvement methods. We quantitatively illustrate the efficacy of the approach across a wide suite of reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Text-driven Adaptation of Foundation Models for Few-shot Surgical Workflow Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Surgical workflow analysis is crucial for improving surgical efficiency and safety. However, previous studies rely heavily on large-scale annotated datasets, posing challenges in cost, scalability, and reliance on expert annotations. To address this, we propose Surg-FTDA (Few-shot Text-driven Adaptation), designed to handle various surgical workflow analysis tasks with minimal paired image-label data.
  Methods: Our approach has two key components. First, Few-shot selection-based modality alignment selects a small subset of images and aligns their embeddings with text embeddings from the downstream task, bridging the modality gap. Second, Text-driven adaptation leverages only text data to train a decoder, eliminating the need for paired image-text data. This decoder is then applied to aligned image embeddings, enabling image-related tasks without explicit image-text pairs.
  Results: We evaluate our approach to generative tasks (image captioning) and discriminative tasks (triplet recognition and phase recognition). Results show that Surg-FTDA outperforms baselines and generalizes well across downstream tasks.
  Conclusion: We propose a text-driven adaptation approach that mitigates the modality gap and handles multiple downstream tasks in surgical workflow analysis, with minimal reliance on large annotated datasets.

      <title>Zero-shot and Few-shot Learning with Instruction-following LLMs for Claim Matching in Automated Fact-checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The claim matching (CM) task can benefit an automated fact-checking pipeline by putting together claims that can be resolved with the same fact-check. In this work, we are the first to explore zero-shot and few-shot learning approaches to the task. We consider CM as a binary classification task and experiment with a set of instruction-following large language models (GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini-1.5-flash, Mistral-7B-Instruct, and Llama-3-8B-Instruct), investigating prompt templates. We introduce a new CM dataset, ClaimMatch, which will be released upon acceptance. We put LLMs to the test in the CM task and find that it can be tackled by leveraging more mature yet similar tasks such as natural language inference or paraphrase detection. We also propose a pipeline for CM, which we evaluate on texts of different lengths.</description>

      <title>RALAD: Bridging the Real-to-Sim Domain Gap in Autonomous Driving with Retrieval-Augmented Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of robust autonomous driving systems, models trained on real-world datasets often struggle to adapt to new environments, particularly when confronted with corner cases such as extreme weather conditions. Collecting these corner cases in the real world is non-trivial, which necessitates the use of simulators for validation. However,the high computational cost and the domain gap in data distribution have hindered the seamless transition between real and simulated driving scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Learning for Autonomous Driving (RALAD), a novel framework designed to bridge the real-to-sim gap at a low cost. RALAD features three primary designs, including (1) domain adaptation via an enhanced Optimal Transport (OT) method that accounts for both individual and grouped image distances, (2) a simple and unified framework that can be applied to various models, and (3) efficient fine-tuning techniques that freeze the computationally expensive layers while maintaining robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that RALAD compensates for the performance degradation in simulated environments while maintaining accuracy in real-world scenarios across three different models. Taking Cross View as an example, the mIOU and mAP metrics in real-world scenarios remain stable before and after RALAD fine-tuning, while in simulated environments,the mIOU and mAP metrics are improved by 10.30% and 12.29%, respectively. Moreover, the re-training cost of our approach is reduced by approximately 88.1%. Our code is available at https://github.com/JiachengZuo/RALAD.git.</description>

      <title>GAMED-Snake: Gradient-aware Adaptive Momentum Evolution Deep Snake Model for Multi-organ Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-organ segmentation is a critical yet challenging task due to complex anatomical backgrounds, blurred boundaries, and diverse morphologies. This study introduces the Gradient-aware Adaptive Momentum Evolution Deep Snake (GAMED-Snake) model, which establishes a novel paradigm for contour-based segmentation by integrating gradient-based learning with adaptive momentum evolution mechanisms. The GAMED-Snake model incorporates three major innovations: First, the Distance Energy Map Prior (DEMP) generates a pixel-level force field that effectively attracts contour points towards the true boundaries, even in scenarios with complex backgrounds and blurred edges. Second, the Differential Convolution Inception Module (DCIM) precisely extracts comprehensive energy gradients, significantly enhancing segmentation accuracy. Third, the Adaptive Momentum Evolution Mechanism (AMEM) employs cross-attention to establish dynamic features across different iterations of evolution, enabling precise boundary alignment for diverse morphologies. Experimental results on four challenging multi-organ segmentation datasets demonstrate that GAMED-Snake improves the mDice metric by approximately 2% compared to state-of-the-art methods. Code will be available at https://github.com/SYSUzrc/GAMED-Snake.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13983v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are pretrained on massive-scale corpora, the issue of data contamination has become increasingly severe, leading to potential overestimation of model performance during evaluation. To address this, we propose AdEval (Alignment-based Dynamic Evaluation), a dynamic data evaluation method aimed at mitigating the impact of data contamination on evaluation reliability. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that AdEval effectively reduces the impact of data contamination on evaluation outcomes, enhancing both the fairness and reliability of the evaluation process.</description>

      <title>TFG-Flow: Training-free Guidance in Multimodal Generative Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an unconditional generative model and a predictor for a target property (e.g., a classifier), the goal of training-free guidance is to generate samples with desirable target properties without additional training. As a highly efficient technique for steering generative models toward flexible outcomes, training-free guidance has gained increasing attention in diffusion models. However, existing methods only handle data in continuous spaces, while many scientific applications involve both continuous and discrete data (referred to as multimodality). Another emerging trend is the growing use of the simple and general flow matching framework in building generative foundation models, where guided generation remains under-explored. To address this, we introduce TFG-Flow, a novel training-free guidance method for multimodal generative flow. TFG-Flow addresses the curse-of-dimensionality while maintaining the property of unbiased sampling in guiding discrete variables. We validate TFG-Flow on four molecular design tasks and show that TFG-Flow has great potential in drug design by generating molecules with desired properties.</description>

      <title>Examining Alignment of Large Language Models through Representative Heuristics: The Case of Political Stereotypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Examining the alignment of large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly important, e.g., when LLMs fail to operate as intended. This study examines the alignment of LLMs with human values for the domain of politics. Prior research has shown that LLM-generated outputs can include political leanings and mimic the stances of political parties on various issues. However, the extent and conditions under which LLMs deviate from empirical positions are insufficiently examined. To address this gap, we analyze the factors that contribute to LLMs' deviations from empirical positions on political issues, aiming to quantify these deviations and identify the conditions that cause them.
  Drawing on findings from cognitive science about representativeness heuristics, i.e., situations where humans lean on representative attributes of a target group in a way that leads to exaggerated beliefs, we scrutinize LLM responses through this heuristics' lens. We conduct experiments to determine how LLMs inflate predictions about political parties, which results in stereotyping. We find that while LLMs can mimic certain political parties' positions, they often exaggerate these positions more than human survey respondents do. Also, LLMs tend to overemphasize representativeness more than humans. This study highlights the susceptibility of LLMs to representativeness heuristics, suggesting a potential vulnerability of LLMs that facilitates political stereotyping. We also test prompt-based mitigation strategies, finding that strategies that can mitigate representative heuristics in humans are also effective in reducing the influence of representativeness on LLM-generated responses.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Rank Allocation for Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have demonstrated their superiority and versatility in modern Natural Language Processing (NLP), effectively adapting to various downstream tasks through further fine-tuning. Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (FedPEFT) has emerged as a promising solution to address privacy and efficiency challenges in distributed training for PLMs on resource-constrained local devices. However, our measurements reveal two key limitations of FedPEFT: heterogeneous data across devices leads to significant performance degradation, and a fixed parameter configuration results in communication inefficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose FedARA, a novel Adaptive Rank Allocation framework for federated parameter-efficient fine-tuning of language models. Specifically, FedARA employs truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) adaptation to enhance similar feature representation across clients, significantly mitigating the adverse effects of data heterogeneity. Subsequently, it utilizes dynamic rank allocation to progressively identify critical ranks, effectively improving communication efficiency. Lastly, it leverages rank-based module pruning to automatically remove inactive modules, steadily reducing local computational cost and memory usage in each federated learning round. Extensive experiments show that FedARA consistently outperforms baselines by an average of 6.95% to 8.49% across various datasets and models under heterogeneous data while significantly improving communication efficiency by 2.40$ \times$. Moreover, experiments on various edge devices demonstrate substantial decreases in total training time and energy consumption by up to 48.90% and 46.95%, respectively.</description>

      <title>StochSync: Stochastic Diffusion Synchronization for Image Generation in Arbitrary Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a zero-shot method for generating images in arbitrary spaces (e.g., a sphere for 360{\deg} panoramas and a mesh surface for texture) using a pretrained image diffusion model. The zero-shot generation of various visual content using a pretrained image diffusion model has been explored mainly in two directions. First, Diffusion Synchronization-performing reverse diffusion processes jointly across different projected spaces while synchronizing them in the target space-generates high-quality outputs when enough conditioning is provided, but it struggles in its absence. Second, Score Distillation Sampling-gradually updating the target space data through gradient descent-results in better coherence but often lacks detail. In this paper, we reveal for the first time the interconnection between these two methods while highlighting their differences. To this end, we propose StochSync, a novel approach that combines the strengths of both, enabling effective performance with weak conditioning. Our experiments demonstrate that StochSync provides the best performance in 360{\deg} panorama generation (where image conditioning is not given), outperforming previous finetuning-based methods, and also delivers comparable results in 3D mesh texturing (where depth conditioning is provided) with previous methods.</description>

      <title>HiBug2: Efficient and Interpretable Error Slice Discovery for Comprehensive Model Debugging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the significant success of deep learning models in computer vision, they often exhibit systematic failures on specific data subsets, known as error slices. Identifying and mitigating these error slices is crucial to enhancing model robustness and reliability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce HiBug2, an automated framework for error slice discovery and model repair. HiBug2 first generates task-specific visual attributes to highlight instances prone to errors through an interpretable and structured process. It then employs an efficient slice enumeration algorithm to systematically identify error slices, overcoming the combinatorial challenges that arise during slice exploration. Additionally, HiBug2 extends its capabilities by predicting error slices beyond the validation set, addressing a key limitation of prior approaches. Extensive experiments across multiple domains, including image classification, pose estimation, and object detection - show that HiBug2 not only improves the coherence and precision of identified error slices but also significantly enhances the model repair capabilities.</description>

      <title>Improving vision-language alignment with graph spiking hybrid Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To bridge the semantic gap between vision and language (VL), it is necessary to develop a good alignment strategy, which includes handling semantic diversity, abstract representation of visual information, and generalization ability of models. Recent works use detector-based bounding boxes or patches with regular partitions to represent visual semantics. While current paradigms have made strides, they are still insufficient for fully capturing the nuanced contextual relations among various objects. This paper proposes a comprehensive visual semantic representation module, necessitating the utilization of panoptic segmentation to generate coherent fine-grained semantic features. Furthermore, we propose a novel Graph Spiking Hybrid Network (GSHN) that integrates the complementary advantages of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to encode visual semantic information. Intriguingly, the model not only encodes the discrete and continuous latent variables of instances but also adeptly captures both local and global contextual features, thereby significantly enhancing the richness and diversity of semantic representations. Leveraging the spatiotemporal properties inherent in SNNs, we employ contrastive learning (CL) to enhance the similarity-based representation of embeddings. This strategy alleviates the computational overhead of the model and enriches meaningful visual representations by constructing positive and negative sample pairs. We design an innovative pre-training method, Spiked Text Learning (STL), which uses text features to improve the encoding ability of discrete semantics. Experiments show that the proposed GSHN exhibits promising results on multiple VL downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>s1: Simple test-time scaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Test-time scaling is a promising new approach to language modeling that uses extra test-time compute to improve performance. Recently, OpenAI's o1 model showed this capability but did not publicly share its methodology, leading to many replication efforts. We seek the simplest approach to achieve test-time scaling and strong reasoning performance. First, we curate a small dataset s1K of 1,000 questions paired with reasoning traces relying on three criteria we validate through ablations: difficulty, diversity, and quality. Second, we develop budget forcing to control test-time compute by forcefully terminating the model's thinking process or lengthening it by appending "Wait" multiple times to the model's generation when it tries to end. This can lead the model to double-check its answer, often fixing incorrect reasoning steps. After supervised finetuning the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct language model on s1K and equipping it with budget forcing, our model s1-32B exceeds o1-preview on competition math questions by up to 27% (MATH and AIME24). Further, scaling s1-32B with budget forcing allows extrapolating beyond its performance without test-time intervention: from 50% to 57% on AIME24. Our model, data, and code are open-source at https://github.com/simplescaling/s1</description>

      <title>Learning to Learn Weight Generation via Trajectory Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based algorithms have emerged as promising techniques for weight generation, particularly in scenarios like multi-task learning that require frequent weight updates. However, existing solutions suffer from limited cross-task transferability. In addition, they only utilize optimal weights as training samples, ignoring the value of other weights in the optimization process. To address these issues, we propose Lt-Di, which integrates the diffusion algorithm with meta-learning to generate weights for unseen tasks. Furthermore, we extend the vanilla diffusion algorithm into a trajectory diffusion algorithm to utilize other weights along the optimization trajectory. Trajectory diffusion decomposes the entire diffusion chain into multiple shorter ones, improving training and inference efficiency. We analyze the convergence properties of the weight generation paradigm and improve convergence efficiency without additional time overhead. Our experiments demonstrate Lt-Di's higher accuracy while reducing computational overhead across various tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, multi-domain generalization, and large-scale language model fine-tuning.Our code is released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Lt-Di-0E51.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report investigates the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms for dynamic resource allocation in wireless communication systems. An environment that includes a base station, multiple antennas, and user equipment is created. Using the RLlib library, various DRL algorithms such as Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are then applied. These algorithms are compared based on their ability to optimize resource allocation, focusing on the impact of different learning rates and scheduling policies. The findings demonstrate that the choice of algorithm and learning rate significantly influences system performance, with DRL providing more efficient resource allocation compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Fast Direct: Query-Efficient Online Black-box Guidance for Diffusion-model Target Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01692v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Guided diffusion-model generation is a promising direction for customizing the generation process of a pre-trained diffusion-model to address the specific downstream tasks. Existing guided diffusion models either rely on training of the guidance model with pre-collected datasets or require the objective functions to be differentiable. However, for most real-world tasks, the offline datasets are often unavailable, and their objective functions are often not differentiable, such as image generation with human preferences, molecular generation for drug discovery, and material design. Thus, we need an $\textbf{online}$ algorithm capable of collecting data during runtime and supporting a $\textbf{black-box}$ objective function. Moreover, the $\textbf{query efficiency}$ of the algorithm is also critical because the objective evaluation of the query is often expensive in the real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel and simple algorithm, $\textbf{Fast Direct}$, for query-efficient online black-box target generation. Our Fast Direct builds a pseudo-target on the data manifold to update the noise sequence of the diffusion model with a universal direction, which is promising to perform query-efficient guided generation. Extensive experiments on twelve high-resolution ($\small {1024 \times 1024}$) image target generation tasks and six 3D-molecule target generation tasks show $\textbf{6}\times$ up to $\textbf{10}\times$ query efficiency improvement and $\textbf{11}\times$ up to $\textbf{44}\times$ query efficiency improvement, respectively. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/kimyong95/guide-stable-diffusion/tree/fast-direct</description>

      <title>PATCH: a deep learning method to assess heterogeneity of artistic practice in historical paintings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The history of art has seen significant shifts in the manner in which artworks are created, making understanding of creative processes a central question in technical art history. In the Renaissance and Early Modern period, paintings were largely produced by master painters directing workshops of apprentices who often contributed to projects. The masters varied significantly in artistic and managerial styles, meaning different combinations of artists and implements might be seen both between masters and within workshops or even individual canvases. Information on how different workshops were managed and the processes by which artworks were created remains elusive. Machine learning methods have potential to unearth new information about artists' creative processes by extending the analysis of brushwork to a microscopic scale. Analysis of workshop paintings, however, presents a challenge in that documentation of the artists and materials involved is sparse, meaning external examples are not available to train networks to recognize their contributions. Here we present a novel machine learning approach we call pairwise assignment training for classifying heterogeneity (PATCH) that is capable of identifying individual artistic practice regimes with no external training data, or "ground truth." The method achieves unsupervised results by supervised means, and outperforms both simple statistical procedures and unsupervised machine learning methods. We apply this method to two historical paintings by the Spanish Renaissance master, El Greco: The Baptism of Christ and Christ on the Cross with Landscape, and our findings regarding the former potentially challenge previous work that has assigned the painting to workshop members. Further, the results of our analyses create a measure of heterogeneity of artistic practice that can be used to characterize artworks across time and space.</description>

      <title>GP-GS: Gaussian Processes for Enhanced Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an efficient photorealistic novel view synthesis method. However, its reliance on sparse Structure-from-Motion (SfM) point clouds consistently compromises the scene reconstruction quality. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel 3D reconstruction framework Gaussian Processes Gaussian Splatting (GP-GS), where a multi-output Gaussian Process model is developed to achieve adaptive and uncertainty-guided densification of sparse SfM point clouds. Specifically, we propose a dynamic sampling and filtering pipeline that adaptively expands the SfM point clouds by leveraging GP-based predictions to infer new candidate points from the input 2D pixels and depth maps. The pipeline utilizes uncertainty estimates to guide the pruning of high-variance predictions, ensuring geometric consistency and enabling the generation of dense point clouds. The densified point clouds provide high-quality initial 3D Gaussians to enhance reconstruction performance. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets across various scales validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>On Memory Construction and Retrieval for Personalized Conversational Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To deliver coherent and personalized experiences in long-term conversations, existing approaches typically perform retrieval augmented response generation by constructing memory banks from conversation history at either the turn-level, session-level, or through summarization techniques.In this paper, we present two key findings: (1) The granularity of memory unit matters: turn-level, session-level, and summarization-based methods each exhibit limitations in both memory retrieval accuracy and the semantic quality of the retrieved content. (2) Prompt compression methods, such as LLMLingua-2, can effectively serve as a denoising mechanism, enhancing memory retrieval accuracy across different granularities. Building on these insights, we propose SeCom, a method that constructs the memory bank at segment level by introducing a conversation segmentation model that partitions long-term conversations into topically coherent segments, while applying compression based denoising on memory units to enhance memory retrieval. Experimental results show that SeCom exhibits a significant performance advantage over baselines on long-term conversation benchmarks LOCOMO and Long-MT-Bench+. Additionally, the proposed conversation segmentation method demonstrates superior performance on dialogue segmentation datasets such as DialSeg711, TIAGE, and SuperDialSeg.</description>

      <title>Matryoshka Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06786v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantizing model weights is critical for reducing the communication and inference costs of large models. However, quantizing models -- especially to low precisions like int4 or int2 -- requires a trade-off in model quality; int2, in particular, is known to severely degrade model quality. Consequently, practitioners are often forced to maintain multiple models with different quantization levels or serve a single model that best satisfies the quality-latency trade-off. On the other hand, integer data types, such as int8, inherently possess a nested (Matryoshka) structure where smaller bit-width integers, like int4 or int2, are nested within the most significant bits. Leveraging this insight, in this paper, we propose Matryoshka Quantization (MatQuant), a novel multi-scale quantization technique that alleviates the aforementioned challenge. This technique allows us to train and maintain a single quantized model but serve it with the precision demanded by the deployment. Furthermore, leveraging MatQuant's co-training and co-distillation regularization, int2 precision models extracted by MatQuant outperform standard int2 quantization by up to to 4% and 7% with OmniQuant and QAT as base algorithms respectively. Finally, we demonstrate that by using an extra bit to represent outliers, a model with an effective precision of 2.05-bit gives an additional 6% improvement with OmniQuant as the base algorithm.</description>

      <title>Fairness in Agentic AI: A Unified Framework for Ethical and Equitable Multi-Agent System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring fairness in decentralized multi-agent systems presents significant challenges due to emergent biases, systemic inefficiencies, and conflicting agent incentives. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of fairness in multi-agent AI, introducing a novel framework where fairness is treated as a dynamic, emergent property of agent interactions. The framework integrates fairness constraints, bias mitigation strategies, and incentive mechanisms to align autonomous agent behaviors with societal values while balancing efficiency and robustness. Through empirical validation, we demonstrate that incorporating fairness constraints results in more equitable decision-making. This work bridges the gap between AI ethics and system design, offering a foundation for accountable, transparent, and socially responsible multi-agent AI systems.</description>

      <title>Modification and Generated-Text Detection: Achieving Dual Detection Capabilities for the Outputs of LLM by Watermark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about potential misuse. One practical solution is to embed a watermark in the text, allowing ownership verification through watermark extraction. Existing methods primarily focus on defending against modification attacks, often neglecting other spoofing attacks. For example, attackers can alter the watermarked text to produce harmful content without compromising the presence of the watermark, which could lead to false attribution of this malicious content to the LLM. This situation poses a serious threat to the LLMs service providers and highlights the significance of achieving modification detection and generated-text detection simultaneously. Therefore, we propose a technique to detect modifications in text for unbiased watermark which is sensitive to modification. We introduce a new metric called ``discarded tokens", which measures the number of tokens not included in watermark detection. When a modification occurs, this metric changes and can serve as evidence of the modification. Additionally, we improve the watermark detection process and introduce a novel method for unbiased watermark. Our experiments demonstrate that we can achieve effective dual detection capabilities: modification detection and generated-text detection by watermark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Malware classification in dynamic environments presents a significant challenge due to concept drift, where the statistical properties of malware data evolve over time, complicating detection efforts. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning framework enhanced with a genetic algorithm to improve malware classification accuracy and adaptability. Our approach incorporates mutation operations and fitness score evaluations within genetic algorithms to continuously refine the deep learning model, ensuring robustness against evolving malware threats. Experimental results demonstrate that this hybrid method significantly enhances classification performance and adaptability, outperforming traditional static models. Our proposed approach offers a promising solution for real-time malware classification in ever-changing cybersecurity landscapes.</description>

      <title>Post-training an LLM for RAG? Train on Self-Generated Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge intensive NLP tasks, such as answering "Who won the latest World Cup?" because the knowledge they learn during training may be insufficient or outdated. Conditioning generation on retrieved documents -- a technique known as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) -- mitigates these shortcomings by allowing the model to leverage in-context information. Practitioners can improve LLM RAG performance by fine-tuning on retrieval-augmented instructions, but must beware that this can cause undesirable model behaviors like hallucinations. We attribute this degradation to the fact that the training data is likely to be out-of-distribution for the model and may suffer from quality issues, such as misalignment between retrievals and target responses (since retrievals are frequently added post-hoc). We propose a recipe for training RAG-enabled LLMs using self-generated demonstrations, thereby avoiding training on out-of-distribution text and integrating retrievals into the LLM responses. We evaluate our method on knowledge intensive question answering (QA) tasks and show that our method teaches LLMs to properly handle in-context retrievals and abstain from questions it will likely get wrong. Compared to conventional RA-IT methods, our method prevents model degradation in non-RAG settings while exhibiting superior QA performance.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Analysis of Uncertainty in Large Language Model Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As LLM-as-a-Judge emerges as a new paradigm for assessing large language models (LLMs), concerns have been raised regarding the alignment, bias, and stability of LLM evaluators. While substantial work has focused on alignment and bias, little research has concentrated on the stability of LLM evaluators. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments involving 9 widely used LLM evaluators across 2 different evaluation settings to investigate the uncertainty in model-based LLM evaluations. We pinpoint that LLM evaluators exhibit varying uncertainty based on model families and sizes. With careful comparative analyses, we find that employing special prompting strategies, whether during inference or post-training, can alleviate evaluation uncertainty to some extent. By utilizing uncertainty to enhance LLM's reliability and detection capability in Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, we further fine-tune an uncertainty-aware LLM evaluator named ConfiLM using a human-annotated fine-tuning set and assess ConfiLM's OOD evaluation ability on a manually designed test set sourced from the 2024 Olympics. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating uncertainty as additional information during the fine-tuning phase can largely improve the model's evaluation performance in OOD scenarios. The code and data are released at: https://github.com/hasakiXie123/LLM-Evaluator-Uncertainty.</description>

      <title>"Nuclear Deployed!": Analyzing Catastrophic Risks in Decision-making of Autonomous LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are evolving into autonomous decision-makers, raising concerns about catastrophic risks in high-stakes scenarios, particularly in Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) domains. Based on the insight that such risks can originate from trade-offs between the agent's Helpful, Harmlessness and Honest (HHH) goals, we build a novel three-stage evaluation framework, which is carefully constructed to effectively and naturally expose such risks. We conduct 14,400 agentic simulations across 12 advanced LLMs, with extensive experiments and analysis. Results reveal that LLM agents can autonomously engage in catastrophic behaviors and deception, without being deliberately induced. Furthermore, stronger reasoning abilities often increase, rather than mitigate, these risks. We also show that these agents can violate instructions and superior commands. On the whole, we empirically prove the existence of catastrophic risks in autonomous LLM agents. We will release our code upon request.</description>

      <title>A MIMO Wireless Channel Foundation Model via CIR-CSI Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of artificial intelligence, self-supervised learning has demonstrated superior generalization capabilities by leveraging large-scale unlabeled datasets for pretraining, which is especially critical for wireless communication models to adapt to a variety of scenarios. This paper innovatively treats Channel State Information (CSI) and Channel Impulse Response (CIR) as naturally aligned multi-modal data and proposes the first MIMO wireless channel foundation model, named CSI-CLIP. By effectively capturing the joint representations of both CIR and CSI, CSI-CLIP exhibits remarkable adaptability across scenarios and robust feature extraction capabilities. Experimental results show that in positioning task, CSI-CLIP reduces the mean error distance by 22%; in beam management task, it increases accuracy by 1% compared to traditional supervised methods, as well as in the channel identification task. These improvements not only highlight the potential and value of CSI-CLIP in integrating sensing and communication but also demonstrate its significant advantages over existing techniques. Moreover, viewing CSI and CIR as multi-modal pairs and contrastive learning for wireless channel foundation model open up new research directions in the domain of MIMO wireless communications.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Test-Time Scaling of o1-like Models: Do they Truly Possess Test-Time Scaling Capabilities?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of test-time scaling in large language models (LLMs), exemplified by OpenAI's o1 series, has advanced reasoning capabilities by scaling computational resource allocation during inference. While successors like QwQ, Deepseek-R1 (R1) and LIMO replicate these advancements, whether these models truly possess test-time scaling capabilities remains underexplored. This study found that longer CoTs of these o1-like models do not consistently enhance accuracy; in fact, correct solutions are often shorter than incorrect ones for the same questions. Further investigation shows this phenomenon is closely related to models' self-revision capabilities - longer CoTs contain more self-revisions, which often lead to performance degradation. We then compare sequential and parallel scaling strategies on QwQ, R1 and LIMO, finding that parallel scaling achieves better coverage and scalability. Based on these insights, we propose Shortest Majority Vote, a method that combines parallel scaling strategies with CoT length characteristics, significantly improving models' test-time scalability compared to conventional majority voting approaches.</description>

      <title>MobileViM: A Light-weight and Dimension-independent Vision Mamba for 3D Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient evaluation of three-dimensional (3D) medical images is crucial for diagnostic and therapeutic practices in healthcare. Recent years have seen a substantial uptake in applying deep learning and computer vision to analyse and interpret medical images. Traditional approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), face significant computational challenges, prompting the need for architectural advancements. Recent efforts have led to the introduction of novel architectures like the ``Mamba'' model as alternative solutions to traditional CNNs or ViTs. The Mamba model excels in the linear processing of one-dimensional data with low computational demands. However, Mamba's potential for 3D medical image analysis remains underexplored and could face significant computational challenges as the dimension increases. This manuscript presents MobileViM, a streamlined architecture for efficient segmentation of 3D medical images. In the MobileViM network, we invent a new dimension-independent mechanism and a dual-direction traversing approach to incorporate with a vision-Mamba-based framework. MobileViM also features a cross-scale bridging technique to improve efficiency and accuracy across various medical imaging modalities. With these enhancements, MobileViM achieves segmentation speeds exceeding 90 frames per second (FPS) on a single graphics processing unit (i.e., NVIDIA RTX 4090). This performance is over 24 FPS faster than the state-of-the-art deep learning models for processing 3D images with the same computational resources. In addition, experimental evaluations demonstrate that MobileViM delivers superior performance, with Dice similarity scores reaching 92.72%, 86.69%, 80.46%, and 77.43% for PENGWIN, BraTS2024, ATLAS, and Toothfairy2 datasets, respectively, which significantly surpasses existing models.</description>

      <title>Offload Rethinking by Cloud Assistance for Efficient Environmental Sound Recognition on LPWANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning-based environmental sound recognition has emerged as a crucial method for ultra-low-power environmental monitoring in biological research and city-scale sensing systems. These systems usually operate under limited resources and are often powered by harvested energy in remote areas. Recent efforts in on-device sound recognition suffer from low accuracy due to resource constraints, whereas cloud offloading strategies are hindered by high communication costs. In this work, we introduce ORCA, a novel resource-efficient cloud-assisted environmental sound recognition system on batteryless devices operating over the Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), targeting wide-area audio sensing applications. We propose a cloud assistance strategy that remedies the low accuracy of on-device inference while minimizing the communication costs for cloud offloading. By leveraging a self-attention-based cloud sub-spectral feature selection method to facilitate efficient on-device inference, ORCA resolves three key challenges for resource-constrained cloud offloading over LPWANs: 1) high communication costs and low data rates, 2) dynamic wireless channel conditions, and 3) unreliable offloading. We implement ORCA on an energy-harvesting batteryless microcontroller and evaluate it in a real world urban sound testbed. Our results show that ORCA outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to $80 \times$ in energy savings and $220 \times$ in latency reduction while maintaining comparable accuracy.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive performance evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving programming challenges from Leetcode, a widely used platform for algorithm practice and technical interviews. We began by crawling the Leetcode website to collect a diverse set of problems encompassing various difficulty levels and topics. Using this dataset, we generated solutions with multiple LLMs, including GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT-turbo). The generated solutions were systematically evaluated for correctness and efficiency. We employed the pass@k metric to assess the success rates within a given number of attempts and analyzed the runtime performance of the solutions. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of current LLMs [10] in code generation and problem-solving tasks, providing insights into their potential applications and areas for improvement in automated programming assistance.</description>

      <title>InductionBench: LLMs Fail in the Simplest Complexity Class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15823v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable improvements in reasoning and many existing benchmarks have been addressed by models such as o1 and o3 either fully or partially. However, a majority of these benchmarks emphasize deductive reasoning, including mathematical and coding tasks in which rules such as mathematical axioms or programming syntax are clearly defined, based on which LLMs can plan and apply these rules to arrive at a solution. In contrast, inductive reasoning, where one infers the underlying rules from observed data, remains less explored. Such inductive processes lie at the heart of scientific discovery, as they enable researchers to extract general principles from empirical observations. To assess whether LLMs possess this capacity, we introduce InductionBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the inductive reasoning ability of LLMs. Our experimental findings reveal that even the most advanced models available struggle to master the simplest complexity classes within the subregular hierarchy of functions, highlighting a notable deficiency in current LLMs' inductive reasoning capabilities. Coda and data are available https://github.com/Wenyueh/inductive_reasoning_benchmark.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Frontier Language Model Agent Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Language Models (LMs) increasingly operate as autonomous agents, accurately forecasting their capabilities becomes crucial for societal preparedness. We evaluate six forecasting methods that predict downstream capabilities of LM agents. We use "one-step" approaches that predict benchmark scores from input metrics like compute or model release date directly or "two-step" approaches that first predict an intermediate metric like the principal component of cross-benchmark performance (PC-1) and human-evaluated competitive Elo ratings. We evaluate our forecasting methods by backtesting them on a dataset of 38 LMs from the OpenLLM 2 leaderboard. We then use the validated two-step approach (Release Date$\to$Elo$\to$Benchmark) to predict LM agent performance for frontier models on three benchmarks: SWE-Bench Verified (software development), Cybench (cybersecurity assessment), and RE-Bench (ML research engineering). Our forecast predicts that by the beginning of 2026, non-specialized LM agents with low capability elicitation will reach a success rate of 54% on SWE-Bench Verified, while state-of-the-art LM agents will reach an 87% success rate. Our approach does not account for recent advances in inference-compute scaling and might thus be too conservative.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Aware Joint DNN Model Deployment and Partition Optimization for Delay-Efficient Collaborative Edge Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edge inference (EI) is a key solution to address the growing challenges of delayed response times, limited scalability, and privacy concerns in cloud-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference. However, deploying DNN models on resource-constrained edge devices faces more severe challenges, such as model storage limitations, dynamic service requests, and privacy risks. This paper proposes a novel framework for privacy-aware joint DNN model deployment and partition optimization to minimize long-term average inference delay under resource and privacy constraints. Specifically, the problem is formulated as a complex optimization problem considering model deployment, user-server association, and model partition strategies. To handle the NP-hardness and future uncertainties, a Lyapunov-based approach is introduced to transform the long-term optimization into a single-time-slot problem, ensuring system performance. Additionally, a coalition formation game model is proposed for edge server association, and a greedy-based algorithm is developed for model deployment within each coalition to efficiently solve the problem. Extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithms effectively reduce inference delay while satisfying privacy constraints, outperforming baseline approaches in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>CORAL: Learning Consistent Representations across Multi-step Training with Lighter Speculative Drafter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding is a powerful technique that accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by leveraging a lightweight speculative draft model. However, existing designs suffers in performance due to misalignment between training and inference. Recent methods have tried to solve this issue by adopting a multi-step training strategy, but the complex inputs of different training steps make it harder for the draft model to converge. To address this, we propose CORAL, a novel framework that improves both accuracy and efficiency in speculative drafting. CORAL introduces Cross-Step Representation Alignment, a method that enhances consistency across multiple training steps, significantly improving speculative drafting performance. Additionally, we identify the LM head as a major bottleneck in the inference speed of the draft model. We introduce a weight-grouping mechanism that selectively activates a subset of LM head parameters during inference, substantially reducing the latency of the draft model. We evaluate CORAL on three LLM families and three benchmark datasets, achieving speedup ratios of 2.50x-4.07x, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as EAGLE-2 and HASS. Our results demonstrate that CORAL effectively mitigates training-inference misalignment and delivers significant speedup for modern LLMs with large vocabularies.</description>

      <title>ReFocus: Reinforcing Mid-Frequency and Key-Frequency Modeling for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements have progressively incorporated frequency-based techniques into deep learning models, leading to notable improvements in accuracy and efficiency for time series analysis tasks. However, the Mid-Frequency Spectrum Gap in the real-world time series, where the energy is concentrated at the low-frequency region while the middle-frequency band is negligible, hinders the ability of existing deep learning models to extract the crucial frequency information. Additionally, the shared Key-Frequency in multivariate time series, where different time series share indistinguishable frequency patterns, is rarely exploited by existing literature. This work introduces a novel module, Adaptive Mid-Frequency Energy Optimizer, based on convolution and residual learning, to emphasize the significance of mid-frequency bands. We also propose an Energy-based Key-Frequency Picking Block to capture shared Key-Frequency, which achieves superior inter-series modeling performance with fewer parameters. A novel Key-Frequency Enhanced Training strategy is employed to further enhance Key-Frequency modeling, where spectral information from other channels is randomly introduced into each channel. Our approach advanced multivariate time series forecasting on the challenging Traffic, ECL, and Solar benchmarks, reducing MSE by 4%, 6%, and 5% compared to the previous SOTA iTransformer.

      <title>Cheems: A Practical Guidance for Building and Evaluating Chinese Reward Models from Scratch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, most RM research is centered on English and relies heavily on synthetic resources, which leads to limited and less reliable datasets and benchmarks for Chinese. To address this gap, we introduce CheemsBench, a fully human-annotated RM evaluation benchmark within Chinese contexts, and CheemsPreference, a large-scale and diverse preference dataset annotated through human-machine collaboration to support Chinese RM training. We systematically evaluate open-source discriminative and generative RMs on CheemsBench and observe significant limitations in their ability to capture human preferences in Chinese scenarios. Additionally, based on CheemsPreference, we construct an RM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on CheemsBench, demonstrating the necessity of human supervision in RM training. Our findings reveal that scaled AI-generated data struggles to fully capture human preferences, emphasizing the importance of high-quality human supervision in RM development.</description>

      <title>Order Matters: Investigate the Position Bias in Multi-constraint Instruction Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world instructions with multiple constraints pose a significant challenge to existing large language models (LLMs). An observation is that the LLMs exhibit dramatic performance fluctuation when disturbing the order of the incorporated constraints. Yet, none of the existing works has systematically investigated this position bias problem in the field of multi-constraint instruction following. To bridge this gap, we design a probing task where we quantitatively measure the difficulty distribution of the constraints by a novel Difficulty Distribution Index (CDDI). Through the experimental results, we find that LLMs are more performant when presented with the constraints in a ``hard-to-easy'' order. This preference can be generalized to LLMs with different architecture or different sizes of parameters. Additionally, we conduct an explanation study, providing an intuitive insight into the correlation between the LLM's attention and constraint orders. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/meowpass/PBIF.</description>

      <title>HybridLinker: Topology-Guided Posterior Sampling for Enhanced Diversity and Validity in 3D Molecular Linker Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linker generation is critical in drug discovery applications such as lead optimization and PROTAC design, where molecular fragments are assembled into diverse drug candidates. Existing methods fall into PC-Free and PC-Aware categories based on their use of 3D point clouds (PC). PC-Free models prioritize diversity but suffer from lower validity due to overlooking PC constraints, while PC-Aware models ensure higher validity but restrict diversity by enforcing strict PC constraints. To overcome these trade-offs without additional training, we propose HybridLinker, a framework that enhances PC-Aware inference by providing diverse bonding topologies from a pretrained PC-Free model as guidance. At its core, we propose LinkerDPS, the first diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) method operating across PC-Free and PC-Aware spaces, bridging molecular topology with 3D point clouds via an energy-inspired function. By transferring the diverse sampling distribution of PC-Free models into the PC-Aware distribution, HybridLinker significantly and consistently surpasses baselines, improving both validity and diversity in foundational molecular design and applied property optimization tasks, establishing a new DPS framework in the molecular and graph domains beyond imaging.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Giving and Calculated Greed in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models demonstrate advanced problem-solving capabilities by incorporating reasoning techniques such as chain of thought and reflection. However, how these reasoning capabilities extend to social intelligence remains unclear. In this study, we investigate this question using economic games that model social dilemmas, where social intelligence plays a crucial role. First, we examine the effects of chain-of-thought and reflection techniques in a public goods game. We then extend our analysis to six economic games on cooperation and punishment, comparing off-the-shelf non-reasoning and reasoning models. We find that reasoning models significantly reduce cooperation and norm enforcement, prioritizing individual rationality. Consequently, groups with more reasoning models exhibit less cooperation and lower gains through repeated interactions. These behaviors parallel human tendencies of "spontaneous giving and calculated greed." Our results suggest the need for AI architectures that incorporate social intelligence alongside reasoning capabilities to ensure that AI supports, rather than disrupts, human cooperative intuition.</description>

      <title>Optimal Brain Apoptosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity and parameter count of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers pose challenges in terms of computational efficiency and resource demands. Pruning has been identified as an effective strategy to address these challenges by removing redundant elements such as neurons, channels, or connections, thereby enhancing computational efficiency without heavily compromising performance. This paper builds on the foundational work of Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) by advancing the methodology of parameter importance estimation using the Hessian matrix. Unlike previous approaches that rely on approximations, we introduce Optimal Brain Apoptosis (OBA), a novel pruning method that calculates the Hessian-vector product value directly for each parameter. By decomposing the Hessian matrix across network layers and identifying conditions under which inter-layer Hessian submatrices are non-zero, we propose a highly efficient technique for computing the second-order Taylor expansion of parameters. This approach allows for a more precise pruning process, particularly in the context of CNNs and Transformers, as validated in our experiments including VGG19, ResNet32, ResNet50, and ViT-B/16 on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and Imagenet datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/NEU-REAL/OBA.</description>

      <title>CLIPure: Purification in Latent Space via CLIP for Adversarially Robust Zero-Shot Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to build an adversarially robust zero-shot image classifier. We ground our work on CLIP, a vision-language pre-trained encoder model that can perform zero-shot classification by matching an image with text prompts ``a photo of a &lt;class-name&gt;.''. Purification is the path we choose since it does not require adversarial training on specific attack types and thus can cope with any foreseen attacks. We then formulate purification risk as the KL divergence between the joint distributions of the purification process of denoising the adversarial samples and the attack process of adding perturbations to benign samples, through bidirectional Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). The final derived results inspire us to explore purification in the multi-modal latent space of CLIP. We propose two variants for our CLIPure approach: CLIPure-Diff which models the likelihood of images' latent vectors with the DiffusionPrior module in DaLLE-2 (modeling the generation process of CLIP's latent vectors), and CLIPure-Cos which models the likelihood with the cosine similarity between the embeddings of an image and ``a photo of a.''. As far as we know, CLIPure is the first purification method in multi-modal latent space and CLIPure-Cos is the first purification method that is not based on generative models, which substantially improves defense efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and 13 datasets that previous CLIP-based defense methods used for evaluating zero-shot classification robustness. Results show that CLIPure boosts the SOTA robustness by a large margin, e.g., from 71.7% to 91.1% on CIFAR10, from 59.6% to 72.6% on ImageNet, and 108% relative improvements of average robustness on the 13 datasets over previous SOTA. The code is available at https://github.com/TMLResearchGroup-CAS/CLIPure.</description>

      <title>Learning to Align Multi-Faceted Evaluation: A Unified and Robust Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used more and more extensively for automated evaluation in various scenarios. Previous studies have attempted to fine-tune open-source LLMs to replicate the evaluation explanations and judgments of powerful proprietary models, such as GPT-4. However, these methods are largely limited to text-based analyses under predefined general criteria, resulting in reduced adaptability for unseen instructions and demonstrating instability in evaluating adherence to quantitative and structural constraints. To address these limitations, we propose a novel evaluation framework, ARJudge, that adaptively formulates evaluation criteria and synthesizes both text-based and code-driven analyses to evaluate LLM responses. ARJudge consists of two components: a fine-tuned Analyzer that generates multi-faceted evaluation analyses and a tuning-free Refiner that combines and refines all analyses to make the final judgment. We construct a Composite Analysis Corpus that integrates tasks for evaluation criteria generation alongside text-based and code-driven analysis generation to train the Analyzer. Our results demonstrate that ARJudge outperforms existing fine-tuned evaluators in effectiveness and robustness. Furthermore, it demonstrates the importance of multi-faceted evaluation and code-driven analyses in enhancing evaluation capabilities.</description>

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are conventionally trained on a per-domain, per-task basis. It creates a significant barrier in transferring the acquired knowledge to different, heterogeneous data setups. This paper introduces GraphBridge, a novel framework to enable knowledge transfer across disparate tasks and domains in GNNs, circumventing the need for modifications to task configurations or graph structures. Specifically, GraphBridge allows for the augmentation of any pre-trained GNN with prediction heads and a bridging network that connects the input to the output layer. This architecture not only preserves the intrinsic knowledge of the original model but also supports outputs of arbitrary dimensions. To mitigate the negative transfer problem, GraphBridge merges the source model with a concurrently trained model, thereby reducing the source bias when applied to the target domain. Our method is thoroughly evaluated across diverse transfer learning scenarios, including Graph2Graph, Node2Node, Graph2Node, and graph2point-cloud. Empirical validation, conducted over 16 datasets representative of these scenarios, confirms the framework's capacity for task- and domain-agnostic transfer learning within graph-like data, marking a significant advancement in the field of GNNs.

      <title>EMT: A Visual Multi-Task Benchmark Dataset for Autonomous Driving in the Arab Gulf Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Emirates Multi-Task (EMT) dataset - the first publicly available dataset for autonomous driving collected in the Arab Gulf region. The EMT dataset captures the unique road topology, high traffic congestion, and distinctive characteristics of the Gulf region, including variations in pedestrian clothing and weather conditions. It contains over 30,000 frames from a dash-camera perspective, along with 570,000 annotated bounding boxes, covering approximately 150 kilometers of driving routes. The EMT dataset supports three primary tasks: tracking, trajectory forecasting and intention prediction. Each benchmark dataset is complemented with corresponding evaluations: (1) multi-agent tracking experiments, focusing on multi-class scenarios and occlusion handling; (2) trajectory forecasting evaluation using deep sequential and interaction-aware models; and (3) intention benchmark experiments conducted for predicting agents intentions from observed trajectories. The dataset is publicly available at avlab.io/emt-dataset, and pre-processing scripts along with evaluation models can be accessed at github.com/AV-Lab/emt-dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Obtaining valuable information from massive data efficiently has become our research goal in the era of Big Data. Text summarization technology has been continuously developed to meet this demand. Recent work has also shown that transformer-based pre-trained language models have achieved great success on various tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Aiming at the problem of Chinese news text summary generation and the application of Transformer structure on Chinese, this paper proposes a Chinese news text summarization model (CNsum) based on Transformer structure, and tests it on Chinese datasets such as THUCNews. The results of the conducted experiments show that CNsum achieves better ROUGE score than the baseline models, which verifies the outperformance of the model.</description>

      <title>Comet: Fine-grained Computation-communication Overlapping for Mixture-of-Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) has been extensively employed to scale large language models to trillion-plus parameters while maintaining a fixed computational cost. The development of large MoE models in the distributed scenario encounters the problem of large communication overhead. The inter-device communication of a MoE layer can occupy 47% time of the entire model execution with popular models and frameworks. Therefore, existing methods suggest the communication in a MoE layer to be pipelined with the computation for overlapping. However, these coarse grained overlapping schemes introduce a notable impairment of computational efficiency and the latency concealing is sub-optimal.
  To this end, we present COMET, an optimized MoE system with fine-grained communication-computation overlapping. Leveraging data dependency analysis and task rescheduling, COMET achieves precise fine-grained overlapping of communication and computation. Through adaptive workload assignment, COMET effectively eliminates fine-grained communication bottlenecks and enhances its adaptability across various scenarios. Our evaluation shows that COMET accelerates the execution of a single MoE layer by $1.96\times$ and for end-to-end execution, COMET delivers a $1.71\times$ speedup on average. COMET has been adopted in the production environment of clusters with ten-thousand-scale of GPUs, achieving savings of millions of GPU hours.</description>

      <title>WalnutData: A UAV Remote Sensing Dataset of Green Walnuts and Model Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The UAV technology is gradually maturing and can provide extremely powerful support for smart agriculture and precise monitoring. Currently, there is no dataset related to green walnuts in the field of agricultural computer vision. Thus, in order to promote the algorithm design in the field of agricultural computer vision, we used UAV to collect remote-sensing data from 8 walnut sample plots. Considering that green walnuts are subject to various lighting conditions and occlusion, we constructed a large-scale dataset with a higher-granularity of target features - WalnutData. This dataset contains a total of 30,240 images and 706,208 instances, and there are 4 target categories: being illuminated by frontal light and unoccluded (A1), being backlit and unoccluded (A2), being illuminated by frontal light and occluded (B1), and being backlit and occluded (B2). Subsequently, we evaluated many mainstream algorithms on WalnutData and used these evaluation results as the baseline standard. The dataset and all evaluation results can be obtained at https://github.com/1wuming/WalnutData.</description>

      <title>DIPSER: A Dataset for In-Person Student Engagement Recognition in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel dataset is introduced, designed to assess student attention within in-person classroom settings. This dataset encompasses RGB camera data, featuring multiple cameras per student to capture both posture and facial expressions, in addition to smartwatch sensor data for each individual. This dataset allows machine learning algorithms to be trained to predict attention and correlate it with emotion. A comprehensive suite of attention and emotion labels for each student is provided, generated through self-reporting as well as evaluations by four different experts. Our dataset uniquely combines facial and environmental camera data, smartwatch metrics, and includes underrepresented ethnicities in similar datasets, all within in-the-wild, in-person settings, making it the most comprehensive dataset of its kind currently available.
  The dataset presented offers an extensive and diverse collection of data pertaining to student interactions across different educational contexts, augmented with additional metadata from other tools. This initiative addresses existing deficiencies by offering a valuable resource for the analysis of student attention and emotion in face-to-face lessons.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Structural-and-Textual Retrieval over Text-rich Graph Knowledge Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-rich Graph Knowledge Bases (TG-KBs) have become increasingly crucial for answering queries by providing textual and structural knowledge. However, current retrieval methods often retrieve these two types of knowledge in isolation without considering their mutual reinforcement and some hybrid methods even bypass structural retrieval entirely after neighboring aggregation. To fill in this gap, we propose a Mixture of Structural-and-Textual Retrieval (MoR) to retrieve these two types of knowledge via a Planning-Reasoning-Organizing framework. In the Planning stage, MoR generates textual planning graphs delineating the logic for answering queries. Following planning graphs, in the Reasoning stage, MoR interweaves structural traversal and textual matching to obtain candidates from TG-KBs. In the Organizing stage, MoR further reranks fetched candidates based on their structural trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MoR in harmonizing structural and textual retrieval with insights, including uneven retrieving performance across different query logics and the benefits of integrating structural trajectories for candidate reranking. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yoega/MoR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology such as Large Language Models (LLMs) have become extremely popular in creating code. This has led to the conjecture that future software jobs will be exclusively conducted by LLMs, and the software industry will cease to exist. But software engineering is much more than producing code -- notably, \emph{maintaining} large software and keeping it reliable is a major part of software engineering, which LLMs are not yet capable of.</description>

      <title>Causality Is Key to Understand and Balance Multiple Goals in Trustworthy ML and Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring trustworthiness in machine learning (ML) systems is crucial as they become increasingly embedded in high-stakes domains. This paper advocates for integrating causal methods into machine learning to navigate the trade-offs among key principles of trustworthy ML, including fairness, privacy, robustness, accuracy, and explainability. While these objectives should ideally be satisfied simultaneously, they are often addressed in isolation, leading to conflicts and suboptimal solutions. Drawing on existing applications of causality in ML that successfully align goals such as fairness and accuracy or privacy and robustness, this paper argues that a causal approach is essential for balancing multiple competing objectives in both trustworthy ML and foundation models. Beyond highlighting these trade-offs, we examine how causality can be practically integrated into ML and foundation models, offering solutions to enhance their reliability and interpretability. Finally, we discuss the challenges, limitations, and opportunities in adopting causal frameworks, paving the way for more accountable and ethically sound AI systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable Decision-Making in Stochastic Environments through Learned Temporal Abstraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequential decision-making in high-dimensional continuous action spaces, particularly in stochastic environments, faces significant computational challenges. We explore this challenge in the traditional offline RL setting, where an agent must learn how to make decisions based on data collected through a stochastic behavior policy. We present Latent Macro Action Planner (L-MAP), which addresses this challenge by learning a set of temporally extended macro-actions through a state-conditional Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), effectively reducing action dimensionality. L-MAP employs a (separate) learned prior model that acts as a latent transition model and allows efficient sampling of plausible actions. During planning, our approach accounts for stochasticity in both the environment and the behavior policy by using Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). In offline RL settings, including stochastic continuous control tasks, L-MAP efficiently searches over discrete latent actions to yield high expected returns. Empirical results demonstrate that L-MAP maintains low decision latency despite increased action dimensionality. Notably, across tasks ranging from continuous control with inherently stochastic dynamics to high-dimensional robotic hand manipulation, L-MAP significantly outperforms existing model-based methods and performs on-par with strong model-free actor-critic baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach in planning in complex and stochastic environments with high-dimensional action spaces.</description>

      <title>The PanAf-FGBG Dataset: Understanding the Impact of Backgrounds in Wildlife Behaviour Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computer vision analysis of camera trap video footage is essential for wildlife conservation, as captured behaviours offer some of the earliest indicators of changes in population health. Recently, several high-impact animal behaviour datasets and methods have been introduced to encourage their use; however, the role of behaviour-correlated background information and its significant effect on out-of-distribution generalisation remain unexplored. In response, we present the PanAf-FGBG dataset, featuring 20 hours of wild chimpanzee behaviours, recorded at over 350 individual camera locations. Uniquely, it pairs every video with a chimpanzee (referred to as a foreground video) with a corresponding background video (with no chimpanzee) from the same camera location. We present two views of the dataset: one with overlapping camera locations and one with disjoint locations. This setup enables, for the first time, direct evaluation of in-distribution and out-of-distribution conditions, and for the impact of backgrounds on behaviour recognition models to be quantified. All clips come with rich behavioural annotations and metadata including unique camera IDs and detailed textual scene descriptions. Additionally, we establish several baselines and present a highly effective latent-space normalisation technique that boosts out-of-distribution performance by +5.42% mAP for convolutional and +3.75% mAP for transformer-based models. Finally, we provide an in-depth analysis on the role of backgrounds in out-of-distribution behaviour recognition, including the so far unexplored impact of background durations (i.e., the count of background frames within foreground videos).</description>

      <title>ECLeKTic: a Novel Challenge Set for Evaluation of Cross-Lingual Knowledge Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To achieve equitable performance across languages, multilingual large language models (LLMs) must be able to abstract knowledge beyond the language in which it was acquired. However, the current literature lacks reliable ways to measure LLMs' capability of cross-lingual knowledge transfer. To that end, we present ECLeKTic, a multilingual closed-book QA (CBQA) dataset that Evaluates Cross-Lingual Knowledge Transfer in a simple, black-box manner. We detected information with uneven coverage across languages by controlling for presence and absence of Wikipedia articles in 12 languages. We generated knowledge-seeking questions in a source language, for which the answer appears in a relevant Wikipedia article and translated them to all other 11 languages, for which the respective Wikipedias lack equivalent articles. Assuming that Wikipedia reflects the prominent knowledge in the LLM's training data, to solve ECLeKTic's CBQA task the model is required to transfer knowledge between languages. Experimenting with 8 LLMs, we show that SOTA models struggle to effectively share knowledge across, languages even if they can predict the answer well for queries in the same language the knowledge was acquired in.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models -- A Panacea for Artificial Intelligence in Pathology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in pathology has evolved from aiding diagnostics to uncovering predictive morphological patterns in whole slide images (WSIs). Recently, foundation models (FMs) leveraging self-supervised pre-training have been widely advocated as a universal solution for diverse downstream tasks. However, open questions remain about their clinical applicability and generalization advantages over end-to-end learning using task-specific (TS) models. Here, we focused on AI with clinical-grade performance for prostate cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading. We present the largest validation of AI for this task, using over 100,000 core needle biopsies from 7,342 patients across 15 sites in 11 countries. We compared two FMs with a fully end-to-end TS model in a multiple instance learning framework. Our findings challenge assumptions that FMs universally outperform TS models. While FMs demonstrated utility in data-scarce scenarios, their performance converged with - and was in some cases surpassed by - TS models when sufficient labeled training data were available. Notably, extensive task-specific training markedly reduced clinically significant misgrading, misdiagnosis of challenging morphologies, and variability across different WSI scanners. Additionally, FMs used up to 35 times more energy than the TS model, raising concerns about their sustainability. Our results underscore that while FMs offer clear advantages for rapid prototyping and research, their role as a universal solution for clinically applicable medical AI remains uncertain. For high-stakes clinical applications, rigorous validation and consideration of task-specific training remain critically important. We advocate for integrating the strengths of FMs and end-to-end learning to achieve robust and resource-efficient AI pathology solutions fit for clinical use.</description>
